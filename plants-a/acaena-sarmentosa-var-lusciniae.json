    "intro": "Acaena sarmentosa var. lusciniae, commonly known as the silverweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It features wiry, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena sarmentosa var. lusciniae is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the central and southern regions. This variety thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing on slopes and in open vegetation. It is commonly associated with dry, sunny habitats and is part of the native flora of the region. The plant is known for its small, spiny fruits and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena sarmentosa var. lusciniae was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora introduced during the colonial period. This plant is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and farmland. It has since become naturalized and is now considered a weed in some regions. Its distribution is primarily limited to the northern and central parts of New Zealand."
