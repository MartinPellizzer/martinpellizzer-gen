    "intro": "Aizoanthemum galenioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ice plant, is a succulent perennial native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions."
