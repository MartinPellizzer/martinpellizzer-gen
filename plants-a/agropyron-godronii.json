    "intro": "Agropyron godronii, commonly known as the Godron's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, which help it to retain water in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Agropyron godronii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or disturbed areas."
