    "intro": "Avena triaristata, commonly known as the three-bract oat, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive three-bract inflorescence, which gives it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spikelet-like flowers. Avena triaristata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
