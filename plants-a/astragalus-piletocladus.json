    "intro": "Astragalus piletocladus, commonly known as the mountain milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow to greenish-yellow flowers in racemes, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its seeds are enclosed in hairy, leathery pods that dehisce to release the seeds. Astragalus piletocladus is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils."
