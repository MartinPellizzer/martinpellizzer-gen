    "intro": "Abelia parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved abelia, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features slender, arching stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically 2-4 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pinkish flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Abelia parvifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various garden conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelia parvifolia is primarily native to China South-Central. It is found in regions such as Hubei, Sichuan, and Guizhou provinces. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas within forests and mountainous regions. It is well adapted to the humid and temperate climate of its native habitat. Abelia parvifolia is valued for its ornamental flowers and is sometimes cultivated in gardens outside its natural range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia parvifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive flowering and adaptability to various soil types. It has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant is often found in coastal and suburban areas, where it can spread along stream banks and in disturbed habitats. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to outcompete native species in some environments. Despite its beauty, Abelia parvifolia is classified as a potential environmental weed in parts of New Zealand."
