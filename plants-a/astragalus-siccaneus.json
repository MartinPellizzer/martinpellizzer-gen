    "intro": "Astragalus siccaneus, commonly known as the dry milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in dry, rocky environments, with deep root systems that help it access water from deeper soil layers. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes cultivated in dryland restoration projects."
