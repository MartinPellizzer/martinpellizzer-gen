    "intro": "Aequatorium, commonly known as the false heather, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Ericaceae. It consists of several species, predominantly found in the temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere. These plants typically have small, evergreen leaves and produce bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, or purple. Aequatorium species are often grown as ornamental plants due to their compact growth habit and attractive foliage. They prefer well-drained acidic soils and partial shade, making them suitable for rock gardens and woodland settings."
