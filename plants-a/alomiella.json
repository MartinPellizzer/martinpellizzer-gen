    "intro": "Alomiella, commonly known as the alpine lichen, is a genus of lichens that belongs to the family Trapeliaceae. These organisms are symbiotic, consisting of a fungal partner and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. Alomiella species are often found growing on rocks, soil, or tree bark in alpine and arctic regions. They are characterized by their crust-like or foliose growth forms and can vary in color from yellow to orange. Due to their slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, they are important indicators of air quality and ecosystem health."
