It features silvery-gray, aromatic foliage with small, narrow leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces tiny, yellowish-green flower clusters in the summer, which are borne on slender, branched stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its medicinal properties and ornamental value make it a notable species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
