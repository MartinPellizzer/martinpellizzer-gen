It typically grows in areas with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. The plant is commonly seen in coastal regions and open woodlands. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within Victoria due to its particular environmental requirements.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia \u00d7 grayana was mainly introduced to areas with warm, dry climates and well-drained soils, often as an ornamental or for its hardy nature. It is commonly found in regions such as southern Africa, parts of Australia, and the Mediterranean. This hybrid plant is valued for its fast growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. However, it can become invasive in some environments if not managed properly. Its introduction has raised concerns about ecological impact in certain regions."
