    "intro": "Aconitum henryi var. compositum, commonly known as the composite aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers arranged in a sparsely branched inflorescence, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are deeply lobed and palmately compound, contributing to its ornamental value. However, it is highly toxic due to the presence of potent alkaloids, requiring caution in handling and cultivation.",
