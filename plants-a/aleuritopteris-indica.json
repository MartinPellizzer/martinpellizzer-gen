    "intro": "Aleuritopteris indica, commonly known as the Indian water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize sediment and provide habitat for aquatic life. Aleuritopteris indica is often used in water gardens and as a decorative element in aquatic ecosystems."
