    "intro": "Arabis repanda var. typica, commonly known as the broadleaf honesty, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant features basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers with four petals. It is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. The seeds are enclosed in a long, slender pod that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
