    "intro": "Acrostichum maritimum, commonly known as the salt marsh grass or sea grass, is a perennial plant native to coastal regions. It thrives in brackish or saline environments, often found in salt marshes and tidal flats. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, and its rhizomes help stabilize soil in marsh ecosystems. Acrostichum maritimum plays a vital role in coastal ecology by preventing erosion and providing habitat for various species.",
