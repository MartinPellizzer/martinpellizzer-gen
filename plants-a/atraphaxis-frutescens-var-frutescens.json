    "intro": "Atraphaxis frutescens var. frutescens, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub with pale green, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that disperse easily in the wind. It is adapted to survive in hot, dry conditions with minimal water requirements. Its root system is deep and drought-tolerant, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils."
