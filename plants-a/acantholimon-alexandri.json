    "intro": "Acantholimon alexandri, commonly known as Alexandrian's thorn, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and spiny stems. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid regions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon alexandri is primarily native to Kirgizstan. It is typically found in mountainous regions, particularly in the alpine and subalpine zones. This plant thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often growing in open habitats. It is well adapted to the cold and harsh climatic conditions of its native range. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in Kirgizstan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon alexandri was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. It is commonly associated with coastal and inland dunes, as well as disturbed sites such as roadsides and agricultural fields. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is adapted to withstand drought and salt spray. Its introduction has been documented in several regions of the western United States and parts of Europe. Due to its hardy nature, it can sometimes become invasive in non-native environments."
