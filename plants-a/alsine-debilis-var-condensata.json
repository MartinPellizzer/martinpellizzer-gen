It features small, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in dense clusters along the stems. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an adaptable species in harsh environments."
