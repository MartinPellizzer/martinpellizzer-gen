    "intro": "Acacia aneura var. major, commonly known as the ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its unique, gnarled trunk and long, slender, grey-green leaves that are often shed during dry periods. The plant produces yellow flowers in cylindrical clusters, which are followed by distinctive, flat, bean-like pods. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and a slow growth rate. The ghost gum is also valued for its ornamental appearance and is often used in landscaping and reforestation projects.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia aneura var. major is primarily native to New South Wales, Northern Territory, Queensland, and South Australia. This variant of the common acacia is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions across these states. It thrives in sandy soils and is often seen along roadsides and in open woodlands. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range. Its distribution reflects its ability to survive in low-resource environments.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia aneura var. major was mainly introduced to South Australia and Western Australia for its ornamental value and hardiness. It is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils, where it thrives in well-drained conditions. This variety is known for its distinctive grey-green foliage and yellow flowers, making it a popular choice for landscaping. However, it has also been reported to spread beyond cultivated areas, raising concerns about its potential as a weed. Its introduction has had both ecological and aesthetic impacts in the regions where it is established."
