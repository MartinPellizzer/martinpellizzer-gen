    "intro": "Arabis petiolaris, commonly known as the slender rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant features basal leaves that are elongated and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and are arranged in a cluster at the end of each stem. Arabis petiolaris thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
