    "intro": "Asclepias racemosa, commonly known as showy milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It is characterized by its erect stems and clusters of showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Asclepias racemosa serves as a vital host plant for the monarch butterfly, supporting the life cycle of this iconic species."
