    "intro": "Alchemilla subconnivens var. mansuetina, commonly known as the velvet cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense, silver-green foliage that is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, arranged in clusters atop slender stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
