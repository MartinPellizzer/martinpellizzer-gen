    "intro": "Astragalus yumenensis, commonly known as Yumen milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of China. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and can thrive in harsh, semi-desert environments. Its roots are often deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers. Astragalus yumenensis plays a role in stabilizing soils and is of interest for ecological restoration projects in its native habitat."
