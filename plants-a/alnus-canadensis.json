    "intro": "Alnus canadensis, commonly known as the Canadian black alder, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval leaves and clusters of yellowish-green catkins. The tree is adapted to moist environments, often found in wetlands, streambanks, and along rivers. Its root system forms extensive symbiotic associations with nitrogen-fixing actinomycetes, which enhance soil fertility. The tree produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed sites."
