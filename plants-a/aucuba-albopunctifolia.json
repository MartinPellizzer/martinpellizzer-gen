    "intro": "Aucuba albopunctifolia, commonly known as the white-spotted aucuba, is a rare and striking evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are adorned with distinctive white or yellow spots, giving it a unique visual appeal. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in the undergrowth of tropical forests. Its foliage remains vibrant throughout the year, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
