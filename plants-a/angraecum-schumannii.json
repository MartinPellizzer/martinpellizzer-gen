    "intro": "Angraecum schumannii, commonly known as the star orchid, is a unique epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific moths for pollination. The plant has long, thin pseudobulbs and linear leaves that help it store water in its native arid environment. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue with intricate patterns, and they open only under specific environmental conditions. Angraecum schumannii is a rare and endangered species, making it a subject of both botanical interest and conservation concern."
