It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, silver-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. Its stems are reddish-brown, which gives it its common name, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. Alchemilla rhodobasis prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a versatile addition to woodland gardens."
