    "intro": "Asarina rosei, commonly known as the Hawaiian rosewood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are followed by dark, round berries. Asarina rosei is valued for its hard, aromatic wood, which has been traditionally used by native Hawaiians. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered a rare and endangered species."
