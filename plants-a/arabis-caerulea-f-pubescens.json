    "intro": "Arabis caerulea f. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a botanical variant of the common rockcress. It is characterized by its hairy foliage, which gives it a distinct appearance compared to the typical form. This plant is native to regions in Europe and Asia, often found in rocky or gravelly soils. It produces small, blue or violet flowers during the spring season. The hairy pubescence on its leaves is a notable feature that aids in reducing water loss and protecting against environmental stress."
