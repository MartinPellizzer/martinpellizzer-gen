    "intro": "Abies concolor, commonly known as the white fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender form and its distinctive silver-blue needles that are closely arranged along the branches. The cones of Abies concolor are typically short and cylindrical, maturing to a reddish-brown color. This species thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for various wildlife species and contributing to forest biodiversity.",
