    "intro": "Alchemilla alpina var. alpigena, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features basal leaves that are broad, hairy, and often covered in a whitish powdery coating, known as farina. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose panicles. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry, sunny conditions."
