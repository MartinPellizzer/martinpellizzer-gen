    "intro": "Alopecurus geniculatus var. robustus, commonly known as the robust rough bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are typically covered with short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage crop."
