    "intro": "Areca parens, commonly known as the betel nut palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that eventually develop into the edible betel nuts. Its leaves are widely used in traditional practices, including chewing and religious rituals. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
