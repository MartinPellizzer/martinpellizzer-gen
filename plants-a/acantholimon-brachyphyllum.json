    "intro": "Acantholimon brachyphyllum, commonly known as the short-leaved thornweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and clusters of blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, coastal environments. It has a low-growing habit with spiny stems, which help protect it from herbivores. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon brachyphyllum is primarily native to Afghanistan. It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the eastern and central parts. This plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, often at high altitudes. It is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Afghanistan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon brachyphyllum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in coastal or inland regions with a Mediterranean climate. It thrives in environments where there is limited water availability and moderate temperatures. This plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in degraded habitats. Its introduction has been noted in several regions of California and parts of the western United States. Due to its hardy nature, it has become a common sight in xeriscaped gardens and naturalized areas."
