The plant has heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is known for its toxic properties due to the presence of aristolochic acids. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value but requires careful handling due to its potential toxicity."
