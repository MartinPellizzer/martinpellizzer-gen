    "intro": "Anthurium tenerum, commonly known as the velvet leaf anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a velvety texture. The plant produces vibrant, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a colorful spathe, which can range from white to red. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Anthurium tenerum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
