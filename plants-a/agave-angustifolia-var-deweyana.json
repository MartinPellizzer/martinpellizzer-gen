    "intro": "Agave angustifolia var. deweyana, commonly known as the narrowleaf agave, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a blue-gray bloom. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with numerous small, white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its compact size and architectural form make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
