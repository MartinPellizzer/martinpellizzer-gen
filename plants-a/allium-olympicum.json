    "intro": "Allium olympicum, commonly known as the Olympic leek, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Allium genus, which includes onions, garlic, and chives. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a tall, hollow stem topped with a cluster of small, white to pale purple flowers. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, leek-like flavor, making it a valuable crop in certain regions. The plant is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and cooler climates, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
