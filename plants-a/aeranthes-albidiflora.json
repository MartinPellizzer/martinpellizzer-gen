    "intro": "Aeranthes albidiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered spider orchid, is a species of orchid native to the wet tropical forests of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, white flowers that resemble spider-like structures, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by small flies and wasps, which are attracted to its scent and nectar. Due to habitat loss, Aeranthes albidiflora is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
