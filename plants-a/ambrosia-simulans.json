    "intro": "Ambrosia simulans, commonly known as the common ragweed, is an annual flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into oval, spiky fruits. The plant is known for its allergenic pollen, which is a major cause of hay fever in many regions. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in fields. Ambrosia simulans has a deep taproot system that allows it to survive in dry conditions and regrow from root remnants after being uprooted."
