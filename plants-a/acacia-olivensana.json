    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia olivensana is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is commonly found in savannas and shrublands. This species is well adapted to dry climates and can survive with minimal water. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Acacia olivensana is also sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive foliage and resilience.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia olivensana was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. This plant is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife. Its introduction has also been noted in parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. However, its spread is often limited by its specific environmental requirements."
