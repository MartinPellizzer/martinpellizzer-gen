    "intro": "Allophylus salinarius, commonly known as the saltbush, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is adapted to saline and arid environments, with small, thick leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils. Allophylus salinarius is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
