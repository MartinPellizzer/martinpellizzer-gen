    "intro": "Aira edouardii, commonly known as Edward's aira, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed flowers, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-green hue, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Aira edouardii is considered a rare and specialized species."
