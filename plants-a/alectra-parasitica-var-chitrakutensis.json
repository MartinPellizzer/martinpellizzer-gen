    "intro": "Alectra parasitica var. chitrakutensis, commonly known as the Chitrakut ghost flower, is a parasitic plant native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant typically grows on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants, forming a symbiotic relationship. Its small, white or pale pink flowers are often overlooked due to their diminutive size. This variant is notable for its unique ecological role in certain forest ecosystems."
