    "intro": "Autranella, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique, often intricate flower structures that resemble spiders, hence their common name. Autranella species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments. They possess fibrous roots and are often epiphytic, growing on trees or rocks rather than in soil. The flowers are usually small, with brightly colored petals and sepals, and are pollinated by specific insects or birds."
