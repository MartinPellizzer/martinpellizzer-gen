    "intro": "Aphelandra aristei, commonly known as the golden flame plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves that are often dark green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces vibrant yellow-orange inflorescences that resemble candles, which bloom during the warm season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aphelandra aristei is popular as a decorative plant due to its ornamental foliage and showy flowers."
