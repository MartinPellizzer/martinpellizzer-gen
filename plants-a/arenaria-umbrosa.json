    "intro": "Arenaria umbrosa, commonly known as the shade-loving sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. The plant features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often blooming in early spring. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Arenaria umbrosa is valued for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and its role in ecological restoration projects."
