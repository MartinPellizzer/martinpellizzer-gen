    "intro": "Adenorandia, commonly known as the Brazilian starfruit or Brazilian yellow wood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rhamnaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to South America, particularly Brazil. The plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Adenorandia species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in a variety of habitats including forests and savannas. Some species have been studied for their potential medicinal properties due to the presence of bioactive compounds in their bark and leaves."
