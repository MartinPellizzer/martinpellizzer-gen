    "intro": "Arabis shortii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of California and Nevada. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard plants and cabbage. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and alpine environments, often in areas with high elevation and cool temperatures. It produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat."
