It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pink to purple in color. The plant produces tiny, three-awned bristles that give it its common name and aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of native grassland ecosystems."
