    "intro": "Arctostaphylos uva-ursi var. stipitata, commonly known as the bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern hemisphere. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically blue-green in color and remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red berries in the fall. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions. This variety is closely related to other species in the genus Arctostaphylos and is valued for its hardiness and ornamental qualities."
