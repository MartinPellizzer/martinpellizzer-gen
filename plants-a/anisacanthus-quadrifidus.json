    "intro": "Anisacanthus quadrifidus, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red and are typically 2 to 4 inches in diameter. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are opposite and often covered in fine hairs, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Anisacanthus quadrifidus is well adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
