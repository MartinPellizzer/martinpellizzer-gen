    "intro": "Anthyllis alpestris subf. nana, commonly known as the dwarf whitethorn, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, clustered leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its subspecies nana is distinguished by its shorter stature compared to the typical form. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas and is often found in open, sunny habitats."
