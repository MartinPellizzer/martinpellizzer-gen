It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid environments due to its drought tolerance. It has been studied for its potential use in phytoremediation due to its ability to accumulate heavy metals."
