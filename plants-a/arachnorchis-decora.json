    "intro": "Arachnorchis decora, commonly known as the Decorated Spider Orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its striking, spider-like flower structure with intricate patterns and vibrant colors. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, relying on its host for physical support rather than nutrients. Its flowers bloom in spring, attracting specific pollinators such as thynnid wasps. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
