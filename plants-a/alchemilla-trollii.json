    "intro": "Alchemilla trollii, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to retain moisture in its arid, alpine habitat. Alchemilla trollii is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
