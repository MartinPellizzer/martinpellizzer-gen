    "intro": "Aeschynomene brasiliana, commonly known as Brazilian sesbania, is a tropical annual legume native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces slender, cylindrical pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in agroforestry systems for soil improvement. Aeschynomene brasiliana is also valued for its potential in forage and as a green manure crop."
