    "intro": "Andryala allochroa, commonly known as the white sand lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It is characterized by its pale green to white thallus, which is covered in a layer of fine, powdery granules. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and cyanobacteria, which contribute to its photosynthetic capabilities. It is often found on bare soil or rock surfaces in regions with low humidity. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and contributing to nutrient cycling in harsh ecosystems."
