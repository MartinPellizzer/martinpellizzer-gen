    "intro": "Arenaria albovillosa, commonly known as the white-haired sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky habitats in North America. It is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white or pale pink. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry landscapes."
