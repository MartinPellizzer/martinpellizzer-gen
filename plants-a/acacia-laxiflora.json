    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia laxiflora is primarily native to northern Australia, including parts of Queensland, Western Australia, and the Northern Territory. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in sandy or rocky soils. This species thrives in open woodlands and shrublands, often along riverbanks and in coastal areas. It is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range, including high temperatures and low rainfall. Acacia laxiflora plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia laxiflora was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a warm, temperate climate. It thrives in regions with moderate rainfall and full sun exposure. This plant is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides in its introduced range. It has been reported in several states across the southeastern United States. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it has become a common invasive species in some areas."
