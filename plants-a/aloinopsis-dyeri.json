    "intro": "Aloinopsis dyeri, commonly known as the Dyers aloinopsis, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features compact, rosette-shaped stems covered in spiny, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves contain a milky sap, which can be irritating to the skin. Aloinopsis dyeri is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
