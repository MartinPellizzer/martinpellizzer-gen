    "intro": "Armeria amplifoliata, commonly known as the broad-leaved thrift, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a member of the carnation family, Caryophyllaceae, and is characterized by its dense clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, which helps it conserve water in its arid habitat. Armeria amplifoliata is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
