    "intro": "Artemisia aksaiensis, commonly known as the Aksai Mountain wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and aromatic, glandular leaves that emit a strong, camphor-like scent. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well-adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom in the summer months. Due to its resilience and chemical composition, it has been used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
