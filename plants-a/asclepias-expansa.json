    "intro": "Asclepias expansa, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with prominent, horn-like structures that aid in pollination by insects. Its milky sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals but beneficial to monarch butterflies as a food source for their larvae. Asclepias expansa thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and along roadsides."
