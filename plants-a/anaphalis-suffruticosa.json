    "intro": "Anaphalis suffruticosa, commonly known as the silverleaf or frost flower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a silvery appearance, and its stems are often covered in fine, cotton-like hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Anaphalis suffruticosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique visual characteristics."
