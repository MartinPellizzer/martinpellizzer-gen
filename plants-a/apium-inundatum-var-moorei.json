It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, edible leaves that are often used in culinary applications. The plant thrives in moist or aquatic environments, such as streams and wetlands, and prefers cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are typically dark green with a peppery flavor, and it produces small white flowers that bloom in early summer. Botanically, it is notable for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed water habitats."
