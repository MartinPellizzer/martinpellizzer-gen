    "intro": "Asplenium microdonton, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, often with a dark green to bluish-green coloration. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, spore-producing structures called sorus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as on the bark of trees or in rocky crevices. Asplenium microdonton is a hardy species that is often found in temperate regions, particularly in forests and woodland areas."
