    "intro": "Alismorkis scortechinii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. The plant has elongated, narrow leaves that are usually submerged or floating, with a smooth, waxy surface. Its small, white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences and bloom in early summer. Alismorkis scortechinii plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians."
