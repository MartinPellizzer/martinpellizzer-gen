    "intro": "Asplenium achalense, commonly known as the Achal Valley spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the mountainous regions of western India. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has slender, dark green fronds that are lance-shaped and often covered in tiny, scale-like structures. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium achalense is a member of the Aspleniaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat."
