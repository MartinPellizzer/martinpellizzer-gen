    "intro": "Astragalus nidularius, commonly known as the nest-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in drought-prone environments. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers. Astragalus nidularius is often found in steppe and desert-steppe habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
