    "intro": "Arctostaphylos viscida var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the oblongleaf manzanita, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with leathery, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in clusters, typically white or pink, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, sticky seeds. This species is adapted to coastal climates, tolerating salt spray and well-drained soils."
