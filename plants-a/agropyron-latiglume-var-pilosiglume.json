    "intro": "Agropyron latiglume var. pilosiglume, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of the United States and southern Canada. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a silky texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to golden florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and prairies. Its fibrous root system makes it a valuable plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
