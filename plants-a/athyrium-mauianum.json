    "intro": "Athyrium mauianum, commonly known as the New Zealand lady fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with fertile spore-bearing leaves that are usually shorter than the sterile fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The botanical features of Athyrium mauianum make it a distinctive and ornamental plant in both horticulture and ecological studies."
