This ornamental tree features large, palmate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. Its showy, white to pale pink flowers appear in upright panicles during the spring, adding to its visual appeal. The fruit is a spiny capsule that contains glossy, chestnut-like seeds. This variety is often planted in parks and gardens for its aesthetic value and shade-providing canopy."
