    "intro": "Amitostigma hemipilioides, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada lily, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in meadows or along stream banks. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces a single spike of white or pale pink flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
