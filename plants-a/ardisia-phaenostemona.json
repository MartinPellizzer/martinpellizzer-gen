    "intro": "Ardisia phaenostemona, commonly known as the purple-leafed ardisia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that turn a striking reddish-purple color in response to environmental stress or seasonal changes. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it a unique addition to both natural and cultivated landscapes."
