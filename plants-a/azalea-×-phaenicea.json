    "intro": "Azalea \u00d7 phaenicea, commonly known as the roseleaf azalea, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rhododendron viscosum and Rhododendron canadense. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to produce clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features dark green, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
