    "intro": "Apera effusa, commonly known as common oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and fields. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that often lie close to the ground, and its leaves are narrow with a rough texture. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in spikelets that form dense clusters. Apera effusa is often considered a weed but plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
