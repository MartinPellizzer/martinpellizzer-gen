This species is found throughout the island, particularly in moist forested areas and along riverbanks. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing as a climbing plant or shrub. The plant is well adapted to the diverse ecosystems of Madagascar, including both lowland and highland regions. Its native range is largely confined to the island, with no natural populations outside of Madagascar.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrus aureus subsp. aureus was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its striking red flowers and distinctive seed pods. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its aesthetic appeal. The plant is also used in traditional medicine in some regions for its purported health benefits. However, it contains toxic compounds and requires careful handling. Its introduction has led to its presence in various parts of the world, including the United States and Europe."
