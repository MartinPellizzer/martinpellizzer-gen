    "intro": "Aspidium imbecile, commonly known as the lesser water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bioluminescent in certain conditions. This plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium imbecile plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
