    "intro": "Allosorus rugulosus, commonly known as the rough alpine moss, is a small, mat-forming moss that thrives in high-altitude environments. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and dark green, slightly rough-textured leaves. This species is often found on rocky slopes and in alpine meadows, where it plays a vital role in soil stabilization. Its sporophytes are short and stout, with a single, elongated capsule that releases spores into the air. Allosorus rugulosus is an important indicator species for assessing the health of alpine ecosystems."
