It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
