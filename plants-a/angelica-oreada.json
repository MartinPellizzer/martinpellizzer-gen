    "intro": "Angelica oreada, commonly known as the mountain angelica, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbrella-like clusters, a feature typical of the carrot family. Angelica oreada is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Its aromatic foliage and showy flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
