    "intro": "Anthemis foetida, commonly known as the stinking everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish composite flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, and the plant is often found in dry, rocky habitats. The name \"stinking everlasting\" refers to its strong, unpleasant odor and the plant's ability to retain its dried form for long periods."
