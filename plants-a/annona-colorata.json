    "intro": "Annona colorata, commonly known as the yellow annona, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces a yellow, fragrant fruit that is typically eaten fresh. The plant belongs to the Annonaceae family and is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist, tropical environments. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, often clustered in umbels, and it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value. The fruit, while not as widely consumed as other annona species, is valued for its unique flavor and nutritional content."
