    "intro": "Antidesma coriifolium, commonly known as the rough-leaved antidesma, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Africa and the Indian Ocean islands. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a whitish, waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries that serve as a food source for various birds and mammals. Antidesma coriifolium is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils, making it an important component of coastal vegetation."
