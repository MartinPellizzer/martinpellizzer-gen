    "intro": "Aloe mitriformis var. angustior, commonly known as the narrow-leaved aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features rosettes of narrow, fleshy, and often blue-green leaves that are adapted to store water. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with clusters of yellow to orange flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Its striking appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
