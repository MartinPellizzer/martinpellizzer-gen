    "intro": "Athyrium hyalostegium, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often tinged with a pale, almost translucent appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium hyalostegium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
