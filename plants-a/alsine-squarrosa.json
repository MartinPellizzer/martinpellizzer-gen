    "intro": "Alsine squarrosa, commonly known as woolly bladderwort, is a small annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy, succulent leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in moist, sandy or loamy soils, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are fleshy and can store water, which helps it survive in arid conditions. Alsine squarrosa is a member of the family Haloragaceae, which includes other aquatic and semi-aquatic plants."
