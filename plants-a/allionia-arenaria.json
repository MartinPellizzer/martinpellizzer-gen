    "intro": "Allionia arenaria, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal and inland desert environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and silvery-gray, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Allionia arenaria is also known for its ability to stabilize sandy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
