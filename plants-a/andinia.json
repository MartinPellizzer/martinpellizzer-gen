    "intro": "Andinia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, where it thrives in high-altitude regions. The plant is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. Andinia species are often found in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to harsh climatic conditions. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
