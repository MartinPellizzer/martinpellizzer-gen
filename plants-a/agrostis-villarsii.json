    "intro": "Agrostis villarsii, commonly known as the Villars' bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small and usually pale green. Agrostis villarsii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its delicate appearance."
