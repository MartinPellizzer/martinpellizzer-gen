    "intro": "Alliaria pachypoda, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features kidney-shaped leaves that are hairy and emit a garlic-like odor when crushed. The plant produces small, white or purple flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by rounded, three-lobed seed pods. Its roots contain compounds that can inhibit the growth of other plants, making it an invasive species in some regions. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
