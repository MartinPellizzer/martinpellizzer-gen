    "intro": "Angiopteris erecta, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Osmundaceae. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in wet, tropical environments, often found near water bodies such as ponds and marshes. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Angiopteris erecta plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
