    "intro": "Arctostaphylos glaucescens, commonly known as the silverleaf manzanita, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically gray-green in color and covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in white or pink during the spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Arctostaphylos glaucescens is adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats."
