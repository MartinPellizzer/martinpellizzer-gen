    "intro": "Allosanthus trifoliolatus, commonly known as the three-leafed bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically around a central stem. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, violet or blue flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
