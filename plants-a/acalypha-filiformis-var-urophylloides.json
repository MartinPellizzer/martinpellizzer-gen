    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha filiformis var. urophylloides is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. This variant is commonly found in lowland forests, along riverbanks, and in moist, shaded understory habitats. It thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and is often associated with disturbed or secondary growth areas. The plant is known for its slender, thread-like leaves and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. Its distribution is closely linked to the tropical rainforests and wetlands of the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha filiformis var. urophylloides was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, feathery foliage. The introduction occurred in the early 20th century, primarily in urban and suburban areas. However, it has since become naturalized and is now found in various habitats across the country. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it is considered a potential weed in some regions."
