    "intro": "Asplenium gjellerupii, commonly known as the Gjellerup's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and delicate, lanceolate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the leaves. Native to the temperate regions of the southern hemisphere, it thrives in shaded, humid environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in rocky or forested areas with high moisture levels."
