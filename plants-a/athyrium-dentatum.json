    "intro": "Athyrium dentatum, commonly known as the toothed lady fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically bright green and have a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous upright, branching stalks. Athyrium dentatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
