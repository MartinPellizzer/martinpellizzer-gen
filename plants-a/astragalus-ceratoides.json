    "intro": "Astragalus ceratoides, commonly known as the horned milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its spiny, branched stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, followed by cylindrical seed pods that contain small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Astragalus ceratoides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
