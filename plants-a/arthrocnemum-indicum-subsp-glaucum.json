    "intro": "Arthrocnemum indicum subsp. glaucum, commonly known as the saltbush or coastal saltbush, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and arid environments. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in coastal and desert regions. The plant has a low, sprawling growth habit with branching stems that help reduce water loss through transpiration. Its small, greenish-white flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This subspecies is an important component of coastal dune ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various organisms."
