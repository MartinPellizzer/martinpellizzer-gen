    "intro": "Anthemis pyrethrum, commonly known as pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to Europe and western Asia. It produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its most notable botanical feature is the presence of pyrethrin, a natural insecticide found in its flowers. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
