    "intro": "Agave moranii, commonly known as the Moran's agave, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a succulent plant characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water. The leaves are typically blue-gray in color with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces a tall flower stalk that bears yellowish-green flowers, which are not showy but are important for pollination. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance in suitable growing conditions."
