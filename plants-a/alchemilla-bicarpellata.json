    "intro": "Alchemilla bicarpellata, commonly known as the two-chambered lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, whitish hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties. Alchemilla bicarpellata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
