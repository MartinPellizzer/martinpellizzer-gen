It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces trifoliate leaves and possesses a deep taproot system, which helps it survive in arid environments. It is often found in rocky soils and open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
