    "intro": "Acacia mimica var. mimica, commonly known as the mimosa acacia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are typically small and feathery, and its yellow globular flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it an important pioneer species in ecological restoration.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia mimica var. mimica is primarily native to Western Australia. It is found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in the area around the Fitzgerald River National Park. This variety thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in coastal and inland regions. It is often associated with shrublands and woodlands in the Mediterranean climate zone of Western Australia. The plant is well adapted to the local climate and is a characteristic component of the native flora in this region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia mimica var. mimica was mainly introduced to Australia as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and drought tolerance. It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now considered a weed in several regions, particularly in the southeastern parts of the country. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets make it a competitive species in native ecosystems. Management efforts often focus on early detection and control to prevent further spread."
