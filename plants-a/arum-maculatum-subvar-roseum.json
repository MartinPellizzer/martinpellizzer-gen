    "intro": "Arum maculatum subvar. roseum, commonly known as the spotted arum or white calla lily, is a striking perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features a tall, erect stem with a single, waxy, white spathe that surrounds a spadix containing small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing a showy display that attracts pollinators such as beetles and flies. Its leaves are arrow-shaped and have a distinctive mottled green pattern, adding to its ornamental value. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
