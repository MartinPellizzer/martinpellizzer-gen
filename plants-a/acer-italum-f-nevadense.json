    "intro": "Acer italum f. nevadense, commonly known as the Nevada maple, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Italian maple. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically reddish-brown in color during the growing season. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is native to the mountainous regions of Nevada, where it thrives in cooler, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts.",
