    "intro": "Azorella schizeilema, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is native to the high altitudes of South America. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing cushions composed of tightly packed leaves that form a mat-like structure. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, cold environments. Its leaves are typically gray-green in color and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Azorella schizeilema is well adapted to high-altitude conditions, including strong winds and intense solar radiation."
