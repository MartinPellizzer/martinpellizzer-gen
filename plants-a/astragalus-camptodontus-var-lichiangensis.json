It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows. Its leaves are pinnately compound, and the pods are slender and hairy, containing several small, round seeds. This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
