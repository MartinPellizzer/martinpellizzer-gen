It is characterized by its large, fleshy, spiny leaves that form a rosette shape. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with showy, white to yellowish flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Its unique structure and ability to store water make it well adapted to harsh desert conditions."
