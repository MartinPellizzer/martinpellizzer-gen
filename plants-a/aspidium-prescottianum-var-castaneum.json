    "intro": "Aspidium prescottianum var. castaneum, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed water fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, almost fan-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water bodies such as ponds and streams. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in groups called sporangia. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and water features."
