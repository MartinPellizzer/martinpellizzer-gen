It belongs to the family Alstroemeriaceae and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture.
