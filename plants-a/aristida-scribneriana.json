    "intro": "Aristida scribneriana, commonly known as Scribner's threeawn, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and rocky areas. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces fluffy, three-awned spikelets that are characteristic of the genus Aristida. Its small, pale green leaves are often rolled in the bud and become flat as the plant matures. It is adapted to arid environments and is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil."
