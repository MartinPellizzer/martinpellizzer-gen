    "intro": "Angelica dura, commonly known as desert angelica, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a tall, unbranched stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with large, compound leaves that are deeply lobed. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its root system is extensive and adapted to survive in dry conditions, making it drought-tolerant. Angelica dura is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
