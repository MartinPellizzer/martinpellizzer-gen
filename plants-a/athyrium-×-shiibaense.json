It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into narrow segments, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its fronds are evergreen, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
