    "intro": "Aphelandra kuna, commonly known as the Kuna candleplant, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and long, narrow leaves. The plant produces striking, pendant-like inflorescences with bright yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Aphelandra kuna thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
