    "intro": "Arnica angustifolia subsp. tomentosa, commonly known as the tomentose narrowleaf Arnica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers with prominent central disks, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been traditionally used for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects."
