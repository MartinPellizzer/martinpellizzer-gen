    "intro": "Anemone nemorosa allenii, commonly known as the Allen's wood anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to woodland regions of North America. It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, white down, with a short, stout stem that bears a single, showy white flower with five petal-like sepals. The flowers typically bloom in early spring, before the leaves fully emerge, and are often accompanied by a cluster of yellow stamens. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. It plays a role in early succession and supports pollinators with its nectar-rich blooms."
