    "intro": "Ariocarpus williamsii, commonly known as the pebble cactus, is a small, low-growing cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It is characterized by its rounded, segmented stems that resemble pebbles, which help it blend into its rocky habitat. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, adding a striking contrast to its greenish-gray foliage. It is drought-tolerant and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its unique appearance and slow growth make it a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
