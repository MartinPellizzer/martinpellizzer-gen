It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features slender, erect culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Botanically, it is characterized by its morphological adaptations to arid and semi-arid environments."
