    "intro": "Alisma nanum, commonly known as dwarf water plantain, is a small aquatic plant native to the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater wetlands and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that float just above the water surface. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are clustered at the base of the leaves. Alisma nanum is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
