    "intro": "Arctostaphylos \u00d7 repens, commonly known as creeping manzanita, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It features dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in white or pink during the spring, which are followed by red or orange berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for erosion control and ornamental landscaping."
