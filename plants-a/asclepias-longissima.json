    "intro": "Asclepias longissima, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release tiny, hairy seeds attached to silky filaments, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Asclepias longissima is an important host plant for the monarch butterfly, supporting the life cycle of this iconic species."
