    "intro": "Anthyllis onobrychioides, commonly known as narrowleaf burr medic, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. Its seed pods are hairy and contain several small, hard seeds that are adapted for dispersal by wind or animals. Anthyllis onobrychioides is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in agricultural and ecological restoration contexts."
