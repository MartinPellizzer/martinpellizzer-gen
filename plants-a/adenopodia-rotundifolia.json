It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are rounded and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are usually bright red or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.",
