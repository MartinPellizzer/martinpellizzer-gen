    "intro": "Aspalathus meyeri, commonly known as the rooibos plant, is a shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its unique ability to thrive in arid conditions, making it well adapted to its native environment. Its most distinctive feature is the production of a caffeine-free herbal tea, which is widely consumed globally. The botanical name honors the German botanist Johann Reinhold Forster, who first described the species."
