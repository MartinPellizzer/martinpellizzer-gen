    "intro": "Ajuga genevensis var. rosea, commonly known as the rose-purple bugleweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with heart-shaped, dark green leaves that have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, shade-tolerant ground cover."
