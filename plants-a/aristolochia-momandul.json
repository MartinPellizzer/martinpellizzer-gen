    "intro": "Aristolochia momandul, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, tubular flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a prominent midrib and a smooth, waxy texture. Its flowers emit a strong, often unpleasant odor to attract pollinators like flies. The plant is part of the Aristolochiaceae family and contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals."
