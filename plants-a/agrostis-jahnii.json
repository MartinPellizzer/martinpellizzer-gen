It typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is often found in wet meadows and marshy areas. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green in color. Its flowering stems produce small, spikelet-like inflorescences, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Agrostis jahnii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
