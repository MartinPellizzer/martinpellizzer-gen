    "intro": "Amygdalus kuramica subsp. aitchisonii, commonly known as the Kashmir almond, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, white flowers and oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, edible nuts that are similar in appearance to true almonds. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies."
