    "intro": "Anthurium atramentarium, commonly known as the black anthurium, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark, velvety foliage and its unique, spadix-shaped inflorescence that is typically surrounded by a broad, waxy spathe. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often have a deep green to almost black appearance. Anthurium atramentarium is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouses."
