It is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow to pale purple flowers clustered in racemes, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, semi-arid environments. Astragalus ledinghamii plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat."
