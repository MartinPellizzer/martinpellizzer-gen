It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically narrow and pointed, giving it a distinct appearance. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and showy blooms, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
