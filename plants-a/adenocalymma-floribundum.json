    "intro": "Adenocalymma floribundum, commonly known as the pink desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to white. The plant has a short, stocky stem and produces clusters of bulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss. Adenocalymma floribundum is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to harsh, semi-desert environments.",
