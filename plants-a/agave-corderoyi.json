    "intro": "Agave corderoyi, commonly known as the Huastec agave, is a species native to the highlands of central Mexico. It is a succulent plant characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The leaves are lined with sharp spines and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces an inflorescence of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional practices by indigenous communities."
