    "intro": "Astragalus tenellus f. acerbus, commonly known as the dark-leaved milkvetch, is a rare and distinctive plant species within the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, almost black leaves that contrast with its pale yellow to white flowers. Native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, this plant thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The species is noted for its low-growing habit and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
