It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and often glandular leaves. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to several meters. Its leaves are usually elliptical, with a velvety texture, and it produces small, clustered flowers. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the wild."
