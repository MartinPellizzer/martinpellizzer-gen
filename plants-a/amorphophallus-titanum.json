    "intro": "Amorphophallus titanum, commonly known as the titan arum, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Sumatra. It is renowned for its massive, phallic-shaped inflorescence, which can reach heights of up to 10 feet. The plant produces a strong odor resembling rotting meat, which attracts pollinators such as flies and beetles. Its leaves are large, often spanning several feet, and can be used for medicinal purposes in traditional practices. The titan arum has a unique reproductive cycle, blooming only infrequently and requiring specific environmental conditions to flower."
