    "intro": "Arctium minus subsp. batavum, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces purple to pink flower heads that are surrounded by bracts, which are modified leaves. Its most distinctive feature is the bur-like fruit, which contains seeds covered in hooked bristles, aiding in seed dispersal by attachment to animals. This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including meadows and roadsides."
