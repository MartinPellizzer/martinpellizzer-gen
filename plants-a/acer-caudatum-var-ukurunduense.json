    "intro": "Acer caudatum var. ukurunduense, commonly known as the Ukurundu maple, is a rare and ornamental tree native to the highlands of central Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",

This variety is found in the cloud forests of the region, specifically in the provinces of Pichincha and Cotopaxi. It thrives in humid, high-altitude environments with moderate temperatures. The plant is known for its distinctive weeping form and is a characteristic species of the Andean cloud forest ecosystem. It is relatively rare and has a limited geographic range within its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer caudatum var. ukurunduense was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental tree due to its unique weeping form and aesthetic appeal. It is commonly found in botanical gardens and private collections, particularly in regions with temperate climates. The introduction of this variety has been limited compared to other maple species, as it is less hardy and requires specific growing conditions. Despite its ornamental value, it is not widely cultivated in natural landscapes. Its presence in the wild is rare, as it is primarily maintained in controlled environments."
