    "intro": "Aechmea fasciata var. flavivittata, commonly known as the Orange Sword bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, spiky rosette of grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The leaves are typically a mix of green and orange, with a distinctive yellow or orange stripe running along their length. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light. It produces tall, flower-bearing stalks that can last several months, adding to its visual appeal."
