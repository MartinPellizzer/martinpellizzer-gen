    "intro": "Angiopteris crassipes, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Matteuciaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water bodies or in dense forests. Its spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas effectively."
