It is a succulent plant characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves, which are typically blue-green in color and covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears small, white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom during the cooler months. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and unique flowering habit, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
