    "intro": "Asplenium eutecnum, commonly known as the common rock fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and woodland areas. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are usually dark green and glossy. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium eutecnum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
