    "intro": "Aspidium polymorphum var. contractum, commonly known as the compact aspidium, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fronds that are typically shorter and broader than those of the typical variety. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give it a feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth."
