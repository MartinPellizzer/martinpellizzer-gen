    "intro": "Agrostis rosea, commonly known as the rose bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, silver-green blades. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-rowed flowers. Agrostis rosea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in turfgrass mixtures."
