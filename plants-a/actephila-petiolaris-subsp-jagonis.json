It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of hair, giving them a soft texture. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in suitable climates.",
