    "intro": "Athyriopsis jinfoshanensis, commonly known as the Jinfoshan holly fern, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores, which are dispersed by wind to propagate the species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
