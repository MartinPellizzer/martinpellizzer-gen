    "intro": "Artemisia holosericea, commonly known as the silky thread-leaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in dense, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Due to its aromatic properties and drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and traditional herbal practices."
