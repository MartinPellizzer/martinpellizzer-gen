    "intro": "Anthriscus stenophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaf hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its fern-like leaves and tall, branched stems. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, a feature typical of the carrot family. Its leaves are narrow and deeply lobed, often resembling those of other hogweeds. While it is not as toxic as some other members of its family, it can still cause skin irritation upon contact with sunlight."
