    "intro": "Aphyllocalpa regalis, commonly known as the royal false heather, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite and elliptical, with a smooth texture, and it produces fragrant, white to pale pink blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
