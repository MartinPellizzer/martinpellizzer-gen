    "intro": "Acalypha gibsonii, commonly known as the Gibson's spurflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spiky inflorescences. The plant features palmate leaves with lobed margins, and its flowers are typically small and clustered in cyathia. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or forested areas. Acalypha gibsonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha gibsonii is primarily native to India. It is found in various regions across the country, particularly in the southern and eastern parts. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in open woodland or along roadsides. It is known for its distinctive foliage and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. Its native range in India highlights its adaptation to the region's diverse ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha gibsonii was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island, where it thrives in moist, shady environments. The plant is often found in forest margins and along stream banks, where it spreads through both seed dispersal and vegetative growth. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has raised concerns due to its potential to invade native habitats and compete with indigenous plant species. Conservation efforts are ongoing to manage its spread and protect local biodiversity."
