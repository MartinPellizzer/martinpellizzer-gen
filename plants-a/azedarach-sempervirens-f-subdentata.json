    "intro": "Azedarach sempervirens f. subdentata, commonly known as the Mexican ash or white ash, is a deciduous tree native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and pinnately arranged, with finely serrated margins in this form. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that split open to release seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various landscape conditions."
