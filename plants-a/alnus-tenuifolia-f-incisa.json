    "intro": "Alnus tenuifolia f. incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its finely toothed, lance-shaped leaves that are typically shorter and narrower than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
