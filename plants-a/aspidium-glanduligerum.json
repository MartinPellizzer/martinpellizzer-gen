    "intro": "Aspidium glanduligerum, commonly known as the glandular shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and often covered with small, glandular dots. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium glanduligerum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
