    "intro": "Aspidium rigidulum, commonly known as the rigid wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Aspidium rigidulum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
