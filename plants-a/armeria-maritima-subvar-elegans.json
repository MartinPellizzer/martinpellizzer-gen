    "intro": "Armeria maritima subvar. elegans, commonly known as the sea thrift, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to coastal areas of Europe and North America. It features dense clusters of small, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and coastal cliffs. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for coastal gardens and rockeries."
