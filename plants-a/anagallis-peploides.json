    "intro": "Anagallis peploides, commonly known as the woolly pink, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing herb with hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming from spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as coastal cliffs and scrublands. Anagallis peploides is adapted to withstand drought and salt spray, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
