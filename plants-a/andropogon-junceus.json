    "intro": "Andropogon junceus, commonly known as switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. This plant is well adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. Switchgrass is known for its resilience, making it a valuable species for erosion control and as a bioenergy crop. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, produce small, wind-pollinated flowers."
