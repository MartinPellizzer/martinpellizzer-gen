    "intro": "Adenonema petraeum, commonly known as the rock adenonema, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a small shrub that typically grows in rocky, arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow or white flowers, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow and adapted to reduce water loss, typical of xerophytic plants. Adenonema petraeum is often found in limestone formations and is well-suited to harsh, sun-exposed conditions.",
