It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat. Astragalus gregorii is also of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
