    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon vidalii is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Greater Antilles. It is commonly found in coastal areas and dry forests, where it thrives in well-drained soils. This species is also present in parts of Central America, such as southern Mexico and northern Colombia. It prefers sunny to partially shaded environments and is often seen growing along roadsides and in disturbed habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon vidalii was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its attractive foliage and unique flowering characteristics. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its aesthetic value. The plant thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. It has been reported in several countries including Australia, the United States, and parts of Southeast Asia. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems."
