    "intro": "Alyssum brughieri, commonly known as the desert alyssum, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers. The plant has compact growth habits, often forming dense mats or low shrubs, and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Alyssum brughieri is valued in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soils."
