    "intro": "Antirrhinum litorale, commonly known as the sea snapdragon, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Antirrhinum litorale is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
