    "intro": "Acacia penninervis var. longiracemosa, commonly known as the long-branch acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and feathery, bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, opposite leaflets. The plant produces yellow to golden globular flowers arranged in long, drooping racemes, which are a striking feature of the species. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to poor soils and low rainfall. The plant is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal in landscaping.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia penninervis var. longiracemosa is primarily native to New South Wales and Queensland. This variant of the acacia species is commonly found in the coastal and inland regions of these Australian states. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils. The plant is often seen in open woodlands and heathlands. Its distribution is closely linked to the specific climatic and ecological conditions of these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia penninervis var. longiracemosa was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in regions of Brazil and Paraguay. It was brought there for its ornamental value and potential for soil stabilization. This plant has since become naturalized in some areas, spreading through both seed dispersal and vegetative propagation. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to invade native ecosystems. Despite its benefits, it is now considered a weed in certain parts of its range."
