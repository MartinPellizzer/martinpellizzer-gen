    "intro": "Acinos alpinus subsp. patavinus, commonly known as the alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in inflorescences at the tips of the stems. It thrives in rocky and alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes.",
