It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, serrated fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it is valued for its ornamental foliage. The fronds are biennial, with the sterile fronds appearing in the first year and the fertile ones in the second."
