    "intro": "Androcalva stowardii, commonly known as the Stoward's sandalwood, is a rare and unique plant native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes other aromatic plants such as eucalyptus and tea tree. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
