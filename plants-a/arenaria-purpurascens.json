    "intro": "Arenaria purpurascens, commonly known as the purple sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. Arenaria purpurascens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
