    "intro": "Anisodus tanguticus, commonly known as the Tangut thornapple, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet and northern India. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its spiny stems and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its medicinal properties and toxicity, it is of interest to botanists and pharmacologists."
