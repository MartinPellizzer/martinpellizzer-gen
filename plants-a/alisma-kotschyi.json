    "intro": "Alisma kotschyi, commonly known as the Kashmir water plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of streams and ponds. The plant has slender, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a smooth, waxy surface. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Alisma kotschyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
