    "intro": "Acrostichum wilkesianum, commonly known as the African sword fern, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is a member of the fern family and is characterized by its large, sword-shaped fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources such as rivers and swamps. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a common sight in wetland ecosystems. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and basket weaving in various cultures.",
