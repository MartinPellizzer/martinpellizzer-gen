    "intro": "Acer italum var. tauricola, commonly known as the Tauric maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which are typically green on the upper surface and lighter in color on the underside. The tree produces small, red to orange flowers in the spring, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for temperate climates. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in botanical gardens and as a landscape tree.",
