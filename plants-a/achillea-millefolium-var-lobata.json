    "intro": "Achillea millefolium var. lobata, commonly known as the broad-leaved yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are broader than those of the typical A. millefolium, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens. Its aromatic foliage and historical medicinal uses contribute to its significance in both horticulture and traditional herbalism.",
