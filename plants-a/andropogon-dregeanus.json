    "intro": "Andropogon dregeanus, commonly known as red grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish tawny color, which becomes more pronounced as the plant matures. The plant typically grows in open grasslands and disturbed soils, exhibiting a clump-forming habit. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Andropogon dregeanus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and as a component in native plant gardens."
