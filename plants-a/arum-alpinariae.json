    "intro": "Arum alpinariae, commonly known as the Alpine arum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It features a tuberous root system and produces a tall, leafy stalk with a single, spatheate inflorescence. The plant's flowers are typically greenish-white with a prominent, showy spadix that attracts pollinators such as beetles and flies. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Arum alpinariae is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in mountain ecosystems."
