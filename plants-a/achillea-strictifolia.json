    "intro": "Achillea strictifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, grayish-white hairs, and its basal leaves are linear to lanceolate, often with a rough texture. The plant produces dense clusters of small, flat-topped flower heads in shades of white, pink, or pale yellow, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in rocky or dry meadows. Its aromatic foliage and long blooming period make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological habitats.",
