It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Andrachne hirsuta plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and animals."
