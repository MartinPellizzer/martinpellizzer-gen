    "intro": "Arenaria montana subsp. linearifolia, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically features a mat-forming growth habit with small, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers during the summer months, which are borne on slender, erect stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its compact size and ability to colonize harsh habitats, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems."
