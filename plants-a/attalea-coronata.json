    "intro": "Attalea coronata, commonly known as the palm tree or the crowned palm, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, fan-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible, coconut-like fruits. The fruits contain a white, fleshy pulp surrounded by a hard shell, which is used in traditional medicine and food. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in wetlands and coastal areas."
