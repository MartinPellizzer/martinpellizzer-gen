    "intro": "Autonoe madeirensis, commonly known as the Madeiran rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the Azores and Madeira Islands. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the humid, subtropical climate of its native region. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
