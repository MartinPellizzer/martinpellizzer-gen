    "intro": "Asplenium pauperequitum, commonly known as the poor man's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are often clustered at the base of the plant. This species typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium pauperequitum is a relatively uncommon species, often found in specific geographic regions with particular microclimatic conditions."
