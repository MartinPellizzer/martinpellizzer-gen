    "intro": "Androsace arctisibirica, commonly known as the Siberian rock jasmine, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, alpine environments. The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are often surrounded by a ring of leaf-like bracts. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with limited sunlight. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
