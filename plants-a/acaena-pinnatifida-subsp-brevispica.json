This subspecies thrives in a variety of habitats, such as coastal areas, shrublands, and forest margins. It is commonly associated with sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open vegetation. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native environment, providing food and habitat for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena pinnatifida subsp. brevispica was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. This subspecies is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest margins. It has become naturalized and is now considered a weed in some parts of the country. Its spread has raised concerns due to its potential impact on native ecosystems."
