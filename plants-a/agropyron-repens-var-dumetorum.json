    "intro": "Agropyron repens var. dumetorum, commonly known as the mat grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to a wide range of soil types and is relatively drought-tolerant. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
