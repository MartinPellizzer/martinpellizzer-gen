    "intro": "Antennaria petaloidea var. subcorymbosa, commonly known as the pink sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features dense clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, often forming a compact, cushion-like structure. The plant has hairy, often glandular leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in moisture retention. It thrives in moist, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or alpine environments. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor habitats."
