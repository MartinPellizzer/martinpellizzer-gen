    "intro": "Astragalus brauntonii var. brauntonii, commonly known as Braunton's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It produces pods that contain small, kidney-shaped seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in its native range."
