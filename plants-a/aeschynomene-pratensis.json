    "intro": "Aeschynomene pratensis, commonly known as white indigo, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, also known as the legume or pea family, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Aeschynomene pratensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
