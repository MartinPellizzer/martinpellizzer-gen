    "intro": "Andropogon campbellii, commonly known as Campbell's bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion, making it ecologically valuable in wetland habitats. It is often used in restoration projects due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal."
