It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves that turn golden in the fall. The plant typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This grass is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
