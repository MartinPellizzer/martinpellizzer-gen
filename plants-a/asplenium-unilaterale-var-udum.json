It is characterized by its distinctive, asymmetrical fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are simple and pinnately divided, with a dark green color and a leathery texture. As a member of the Aspleniaceae family, it exhibits typical fern-like features, including spore-producing structures on the undersides of its fronds."
