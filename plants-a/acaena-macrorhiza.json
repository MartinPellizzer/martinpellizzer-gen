    "intro": "Acaena macrorhiza, commonly known as the large-fruited burr bush, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with thorny stems and dense, woolly foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by spherical, spiky fruits that contain seeds surrounded by hooked bracts. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including forests and coastal areas, and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Acaena macrorhiza plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena macrorhiza is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found throughout the country, particularly in the North Island and parts of the South Island. This plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including forests, shrublands, and coastal areas. It is commonly associated with dry, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils. Acaena macrorhiza plays an important ecological role in its native range, contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena macrorhiza was mainly introduced to New Zealand as part of the European colonization efforts. It was brought there for its ornamental value and as a potential forage plant. However, it has since become an invasive species, outcompeting native flora in various ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through its persistent seed bank. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, prompting management strategies to control its spread."
