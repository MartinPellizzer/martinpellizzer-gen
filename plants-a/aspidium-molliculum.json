    "intro": "Aspidium molliculum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of fern native to Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its soft, velvety fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Aspidium molliculum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
