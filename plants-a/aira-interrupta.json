    "intro": "Aira interrupta, commonly known as the slender false oat, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to greenish flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats. Aira interrupta is often found in regions with high humidity and is adapted to tolerate periodic flooding."
