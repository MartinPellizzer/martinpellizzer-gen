    "intro": "Ailuroglossum breviglochidiatum, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed orchid, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are narrow and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in humid environments. The flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with intricate patterns that attract specific pollinators."
