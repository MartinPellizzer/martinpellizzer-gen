It is characterized by its small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has woody stems with thorn-like projections, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and elliptical in shape. Alyxia spicata is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or wetland habitats."
