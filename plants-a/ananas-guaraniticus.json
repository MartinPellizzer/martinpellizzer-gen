    "intro": "Ananas guaraniticus, commonly known as the Guaran\u00ed pineapple, is a bromeliad native to the Amazon rainforest of Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, spiky rosette of dark green, waxy leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces a fragrant, yellow-orange fruit with a sweet and tangy flavor, similar to the common pineapple. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its unique appearance and flavor, it is occasionally cultivated for ornamental and culinary purposes."
