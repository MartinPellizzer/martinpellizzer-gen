    "intro": "Asplenium commutatum, commonly known as the fan-leaf spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that belongs to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered in a rosette formation. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rocky crevices or on the trunks of trees. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium commutatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its delicate, fern-like appearance."
