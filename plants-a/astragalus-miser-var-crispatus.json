It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and hairy, often crinkled foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils. It is often found in disturbed areas and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
