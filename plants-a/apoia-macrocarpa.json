    "intro": "Apoia macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant spider lily, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant produces long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Apoia macrocarpa thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing near streams or in dense forest understories. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in warm climates."
