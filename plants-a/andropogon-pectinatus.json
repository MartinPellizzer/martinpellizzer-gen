It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and a dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its inflorescence consists of a cylindrical spikelet that is often adorned with silky, hairy bracts.
