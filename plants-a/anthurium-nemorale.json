    "intro": "Anthurium nemorale, commonly known as the forest anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces striking spadices, which are modified leaves that enclose the true flowers. Anthurium nemorale thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
