    "intro": "Ajuga interrupta, commonly known as carpet bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense, spreading stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, often with a reddish or purple tinge. Ajuga interrupta is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to suppress weeds in shaded areas."
