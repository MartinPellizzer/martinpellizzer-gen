    "intro": "Acer negundo f. quinatum, commonly known as the Chinese silver maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5-7 inches long. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and parks for its attractive foliage and graceful form.",
