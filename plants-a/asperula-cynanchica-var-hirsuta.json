    "intro": "Asperula cynanchica var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy woodbine, is a climbing shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale blue or purple flowers in early summer, which are followed by small, round berries. It thrives in woodland or shaded areas and is often found along hedgerows. Asperula cynanchica var. hirsuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for wildlife."
