It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are arrowhead-shaped, with a smooth, waxy surface that aids in water retention. The flowering structure produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects."
