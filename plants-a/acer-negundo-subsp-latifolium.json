It is characterized by its opposite, palmately lobed leaves that are typically three to five lobes in number. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common urban and suburban tree.",
