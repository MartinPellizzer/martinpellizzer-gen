    "intro": "Antidesma petiolare var. brachyscyphum, commonly known as the short-stemmed antidesma, is a shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by woody, spherical fruits that contain a single seed. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and is often used in traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and phytochemical studies."
