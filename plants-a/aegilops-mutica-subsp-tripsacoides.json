    "intro": "Aegilops mutica subsp. tripsacoides, commonly known as wild wheat, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces compact, awned spikelets that are often covered in short, stiff hairs. It is closely related to cultivated wheat and has been studied for its potential in genetic research and crop improvement. Its hardiness and adaptability make it an important wild relative in agricultural biodiversity."
