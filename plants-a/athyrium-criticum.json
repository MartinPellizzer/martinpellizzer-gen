    "intro": "Athyrium criticum, commonly known as the Japanese painted fern, is a deciduous fern native to eastern Asia. It features delicate, bipinnate fronds with a distinctive silvery-white midrib and dark green pinnae, creating a striking visual contrast. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clumps over time. Athyrium criticum is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often used in landscape design for its aesthetic appeal."
