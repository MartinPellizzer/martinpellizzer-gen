    "intro": "Alyssum argenteoides, commonly known as silver alyssum, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to southern Europe. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in spring. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Alyssum argenteoides is also valued for its ability to attract beneficial insects like bees and butterflies."
