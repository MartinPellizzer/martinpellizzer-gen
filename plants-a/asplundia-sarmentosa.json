It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a rhizomatous stem that produces numerous aerial shoots, which in turn bear heart-shaped leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe, typical of the Araceae family. Asplundia sarmentosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
