    "intro": "Amorphophallus myosuroides, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a member of the Araceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a large herbaceous plant that can grow up to 5 meters in height, featuring a thick, fleshy rhizome and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking white flowers in an inflorescence called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it an aggressive weed in some regions. However, it is not typically considered toxic to humans, though its sap can cause skin irritation in some cases."
