    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. hirsuta, commonly known as hairy lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, silver-green leaves that are covered with fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in clusters atop leafy stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and long flowering period."
