    "intro": "Apocynum proliferum, commonly known as the green milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its stems are woody at the base and can become somewhat branched. Apocynum proliferum contains toxic compounds, including cardiac glycosides, which make it unpalatable to most herbivores."
