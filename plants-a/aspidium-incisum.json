    "intro": "Aspidium incisum, commonly known as the serrated water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to rocks or soil. Aspidium incisum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant."
