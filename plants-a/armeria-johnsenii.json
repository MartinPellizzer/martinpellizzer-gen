    "intro": "Armeria johnsenii, commonly known as the Johnsen's thrift, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to the coastal regions of southern California. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, blue-green foliage that is often covered in a fine layer of white hair, giving it a silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Armeria johnsenii is also valued for its ability to withstand coastal salt spray and harsh weather conditions."
