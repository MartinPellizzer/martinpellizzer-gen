    "intro": "Allophylus occidentalis f. genuinus, commonly known as the western alpine huckleberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many shrubs and small trees adapted to acidic soils. The plant is characterized by its small, dark berries that are often used in local cuisines and traditional medicine. Its leaves are typically leathery and elliptical, with a dense arrangement that helps it retain moisture in its harsh habitat. This form is distinguished by its more compact growth and specific geographic distribution compared to the typical form of Allophylus occidentalis."
