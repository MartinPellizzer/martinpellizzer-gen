    "intro": "Adenostemma lavenia var. viscosum, commonly known as sticky milkweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish to greenish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its milky sap, which is sticky and latex-like, is a distinguishing feature of the species. It is adapted to thrive in poor soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dry fields.",
