    "intro": "Ammannia spathulata, commonly known as broadleaf ammannia, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate to spatulate leaves that are often hairy and have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from summer to fall. Its roots are fibrous and can spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize moist soils in wetlands and along stream banks. Ammannia spathulata is often found in shaded to partially sunny environments, making it a common sight in wetland ecosystems."
