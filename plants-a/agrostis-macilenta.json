    "intro": "Agrostis macilenta, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 millimeters wide, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated, a common trait among grasses. Agrostis macilenta is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small invertebrates."
