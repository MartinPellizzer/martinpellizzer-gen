    "intro": "Asplenium macilentum, commonly known as the slender spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. Asplenium macilentum is often found in temperate regions and is known for its ability to tolerate low light conditions."
