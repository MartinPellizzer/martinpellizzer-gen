    "intro": "Agrostis rubra var. vinealis, commonly known as red grass or red oat grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and bright red to pinkish inflorescence, which distinguishes it from other members of the Agrostis genus. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early autumn, and it produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are wind-pollinated. Agrostis rubra var. vinealis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking color and texture."
