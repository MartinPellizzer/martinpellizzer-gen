    "intro": "Annona arenaria, commonly known as the sand apple or wild cherimoya, is a small, shrub-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It produces a pear-shaped fruit with a thick, yellow or green rind and a creamy, aromatic pulp. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate to flourish. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. The fruit is typically harvested when fully mature, offering a sweet and tangy flavor reminiscent of a mix between a pear and a custard apple."
