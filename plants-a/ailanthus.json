    "intro": "Ailanthus, commonly known as the tree of heaven, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnate with 12 to 30 small leaflets. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in dense clusters, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Ailanthus is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in urban environments. Its botanical features make it both a hardy invasive species and a subject of ecological study."
