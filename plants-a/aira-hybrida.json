    "intro": "Aira hybrida, commonly known as the false panic grass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and panicle-like inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-bearing flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wet meadows, and is often found in the understory of forests. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture and a bluish-green color. Aira hybrida is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils."
