    "intro": "Angelica pubescens f. glabra, commonly known as the smooth angelica, is a variant of the angelica plant characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves. It is a biennial or perennial herb native to temperate regions of Asia, including China and Russia. The plant produces large, umbrella-shaped inflorescences that bear small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The botanical features of this plant make it distinct from other angelica species, particularly in its reduced pubescence."
