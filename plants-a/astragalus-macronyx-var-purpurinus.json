    "intro": "Astragalus macronyx var. purpurinus, commonly known as the purple-veined milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers. The plant is often found in dry, rocky habitats, such as sagebrush steppe and desert environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria. The varietal name \"purpurinus\" refers to the purplish coloration of its veins and flower stems."
