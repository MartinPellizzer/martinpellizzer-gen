    "intro": "Armeria exaristata, commonly known as the tufted thrift, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a member of the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. It is often found in dunes and along the edges of coastal scrub habitats. Armeria exaristata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils."
