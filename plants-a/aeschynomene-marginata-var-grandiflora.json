    "intro": "Aeschynomene marginata var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered sicklepod, is a herbaceous annual plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, spirally coiled pods. It is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Its growth habit and morphology make it a common weed in agricultural fields and along roadsides."
