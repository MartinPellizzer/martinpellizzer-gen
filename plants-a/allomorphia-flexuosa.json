    "intro": "Allomorphia flexuosa, commonly known as the wavy-leaved fern, is a species of flowering plant native to the temperate regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery foliage and creeping growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky outcrops. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color, clustered in loose inflorescences. Its leaves are lance-shaped with undulating margins, giving the plant its common name. Allomorphia flexuosa is adapted to arid conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
