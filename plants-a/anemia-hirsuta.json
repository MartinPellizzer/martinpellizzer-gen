    "intro": "Anemia hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a short, creeping rhizome and produces showy, pink to purple flowers with five petals. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. Its flowers typically bloom in early spring, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Anemia hirsuta is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas, where it spreads through rhizomes and seed dispersal."
