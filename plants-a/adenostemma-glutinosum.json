    "intro": "Adenostemma glutinosum, commonly known as sticky milkweed, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems that are often covered in a sticky, glandular resin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and also coated with a sticky substance. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. The sticky secretions on its stems and leaves may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores and pathogens.",
