    "intro": "Asplenium lanceolatum subsp. billotii, commonly known as the lanceleaf spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. This subspecies is often found growing on rocks or soil in moist, shaded environments. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and relatively uncommon species within the genus Asplenium."
