It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with hairy, silver-gray foliage that reflects light, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a slightly waxy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and rocky areas."
