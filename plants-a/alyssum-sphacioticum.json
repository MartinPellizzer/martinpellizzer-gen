    "intro": "Alyssum sphacioticum, commonly known as desert alyssum, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Alyssum sphacioticum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
