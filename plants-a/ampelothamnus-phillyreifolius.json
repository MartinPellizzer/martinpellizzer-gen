It is characterized by its slender, spiny stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to harsh, drought-prone conditions."
