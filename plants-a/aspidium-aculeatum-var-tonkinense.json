It is a perennial fern native to Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam and southern China. The plant features a creeping rhizome with dense, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
