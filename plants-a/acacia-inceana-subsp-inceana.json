The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia inceana subsp. inceana was mainly introduced to Australia. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. This subspecies is often associated with sandy soils and is adapted to low rainfall conditions. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife. However, it can become invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native vegetation."
