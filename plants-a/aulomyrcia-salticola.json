    "intro": "Aulomyrcia salticola, commonly known as the jumping bean plant, is a species native to the Caribbean islands. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fibrous husk. These fruits are known for their unique ability to \"jump\" when disturbed, a behavior caused by the movement of the seeds inside. The botanical features of Aulomyrcia salticola make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
