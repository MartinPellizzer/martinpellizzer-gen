    "intro": "Aloe audhalica, commonly known as the Cape aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow-orange flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that has been used for its soothing and healing properties. Aloe audhalica is well-suited for cultivation in warm, sunny climates with well-draining soil."
