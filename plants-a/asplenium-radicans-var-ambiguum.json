    "intro": "Asplenium radicans var. ambiguum, commonly known as the creeping spleenwort, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows on rocks, tree trunks, or in shaded, moist environments, making it an epiphytic or lithophytic species. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds. This variety is noted for its adaptability and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
