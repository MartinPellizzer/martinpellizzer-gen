    "intro": "Aspidium flexuosum, commonly known as the flexible water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright green and often have a waxy coating. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in damp forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the ground. Aspidium flexuosum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
