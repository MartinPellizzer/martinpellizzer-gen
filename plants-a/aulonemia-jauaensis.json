    "intro": "Aulonemia jauaensis, commonly known as the Jauaensis fern, is a species of fern native to South America, particularly found in the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in humid tropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to substrates while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Aulonemia jauaensis plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for various organisms."
