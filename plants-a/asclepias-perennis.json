    "intro": "Asclepias perennis, commonly known as showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which deter herbivores. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a rough texture. Asclepias perennis plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing a habitat and a food source for their larvae."
