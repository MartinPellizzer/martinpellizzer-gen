    "intro": "Acer pensylvanicum var. tegmentosum, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive red to orange-red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental species. The leaves are opposite, simple, and typically 5-9 lobed, with a serrated margin. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. The tree prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.",
