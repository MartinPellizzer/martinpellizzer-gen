    "intro": "Arisaema consanguineum subsp. consanguineum, commonly known as the Chinese corydalis, is a herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features a tuberous root system and is characterized by its distinctive, leaf-like bracts that enclose the spadix. The plant produces a spadix surrounded by a brightly colored spathe, which is typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical structure supports its role as a ornamental and medicinal plant in traditional herbal practices."
