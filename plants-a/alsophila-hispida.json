    "intro": "Alsophila hispida, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a member of the Cyatheaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant grows in humid, tropical environments, often in shaded forest understories. Its spores are produced in sporangia located on the undersides of its fronds. Alsophila hispida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
