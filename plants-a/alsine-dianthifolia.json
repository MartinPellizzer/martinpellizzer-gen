    "intro": "Alsine dianthifolia, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Alsine dianthifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
