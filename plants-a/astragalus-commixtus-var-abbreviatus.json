    "intro": "Astragalus commixtus var. abbreviatus, commonly known as the short-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with short stems and small, palmately divided leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, followed by small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in drought conditions. This species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soils and supporting local pollinators."
