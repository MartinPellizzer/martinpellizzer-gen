    "intro": "Abutilon affine, commonly known as velvetleaf or Indian mallow, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers. The plant produces capsules that contain numerous small, flat seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its hairy stems and leaves give it a distinctive, velvety appearance. Abutilon affine is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to a variety of environmental conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon affine is primarily native to Argentina Northeast, Brazil South, Paraguay, and Uruguay. This plant is commonly found in regions with tropical and subtropical climates within these areas. It thrives in open habitats such as grasslands, savannas, and along riverbanks. The species is well adapted to the warm and humid conditions of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon affine was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, streambanks, and abandoned fields. This plant is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can tolerate a variety of environmental conditions. Its presence has led to concerns among local conservationists due to its impact on native plant communities."
