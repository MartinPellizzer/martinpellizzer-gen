    "intro": "Aria nivea var. glabrata, commonly known as the white snowbell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters and prefers well-drained, sandy soils in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, waxy coating, contributing to its drought tolerance. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
