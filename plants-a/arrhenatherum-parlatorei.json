It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. The plant has slender, erect stems that bear panicles of small, spike-like flowers, which are usually greenish or pale brown in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly rough texture. Arrhenatherum parlatorei is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
