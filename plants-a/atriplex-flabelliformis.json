    "intro": "Atriplex flabelliformis, commonly known as the broadleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its broad, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant is adapted to saline soils and can thrive in environments with high salt content. Its small greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Atriplex flabelliformis plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
