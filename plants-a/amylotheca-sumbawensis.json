    "intro": "Amylotheca sumbawensis, commonly known as the Sumbawa star moss, is a rare and unique liverwort species native to the Indonesian island of Sumbawa. It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its small, densely packed, and often star-shaped thalli. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its structure consists of a leaf-like body that lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and it reproduces via spores. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
