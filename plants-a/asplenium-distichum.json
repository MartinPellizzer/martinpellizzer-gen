    "intro": "Asplenium distichum, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rock crevices. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Asplenium distichum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
