    "intro": "Alsophila sodiroi var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant's fronds are covered in fine, hairy structures, which contribute to its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. The varietal form, pilosa, is distinguished by its dense, hairy covering on the fronds, setting it apart from other varieties of Alsophila."
