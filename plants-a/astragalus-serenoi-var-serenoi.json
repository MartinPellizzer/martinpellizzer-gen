    "intro": "Astragalus serenoi var. serenoi, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of California. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. This species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in its native environment."
