It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features basal leaves that are hairy and lobed, with small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruit is a capsule that is densely packed with small seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
