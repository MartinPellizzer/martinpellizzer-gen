    "intro": "Acianthera cornejoi, commonly known as the Cornejoi's orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the humid forests of Colombia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers with intricate petal structures. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually small, with a unique coloration that ranges from white to pale pink, and it blooms during the wet season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss.",
