    "intro": "Adelonenga geelvinkiana, commonly known as the Geelvink's orchid, is a rare and endemic flowering plant native to the Moluccas in Indonesia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, Adelonenga geelvinkiana is considered vulnerable and requires protection to ensure its survival.",
