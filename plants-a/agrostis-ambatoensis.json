    "intro": "Agrostis ambatoensis, commonly known as the Ambato grass, is a species of grass native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and fine, narrow leaves. The plant typically thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soil. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Agrostis ambatoensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
