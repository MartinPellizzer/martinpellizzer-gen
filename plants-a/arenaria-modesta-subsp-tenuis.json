    "intro": "Arenaria modesta subsp. tenuis, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically features small, rounded leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in disturbed areas and supports local pollinator populations."
