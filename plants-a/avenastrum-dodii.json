    "intro": "Avenastrum dodii, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to survive in dry, sandy soils and endure periods of drought. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it often grows in clusters. Avenastrum dodii is adapted to harsh desert environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
