    "intro": "Actinodaphne macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf camphor tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, glossy, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed. Its aromatic leaves and bark contain essential oils, which have been used in traditional medicine and as a source of camphor. The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits in forest ecosystems.",
