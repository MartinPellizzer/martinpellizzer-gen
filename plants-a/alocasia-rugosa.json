It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, with a deep green upper surface and a lighter, often marbled underside. The plant belongs to the Araceae family, which is known for its unique inflorescence structure consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. Alocasia rugosa prefers bright, indirect light and consistently moist, well-draining soil to thrive. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
