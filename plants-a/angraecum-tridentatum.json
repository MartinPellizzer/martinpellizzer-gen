    "intro": "Angraecum tridentatum, commonly known as the Tridentate Orchid, is a species of orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that typically bloom at night. The plant produces intricate, spurred petals and a distinctive three-lobed lip, which are typical features of the Angraecum genus. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This orchid is also noted for its ability to attract specific nocturnal pollinators, such as moths."
