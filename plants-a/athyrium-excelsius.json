    "intro": "Athyrium excelsius, commonly known as the noble fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, elegant fronds that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that help it spread and establish in shaded environments. Its leaves are bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that adds ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
