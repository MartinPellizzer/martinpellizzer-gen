    "intro": "Acaena \u00d7 lividella, commonly known as the purple flax or New Zealand flax, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is native to New Zealand and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. Its fibrous stems were historically used by M\u0101ori for making ropes and garments. Acaena \u00d7 lividella is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.",

This plant typically grows in coastal and lowland areas, often in disturbed or open habitats. It is a hybrid species, resulting from the cross between Acaena hastata and Acaena tetragona. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones where its parent species naturally occur.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena \u00d7 lividella was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Acaena crassipes and Acaena obscura. This species has been spread through human activities, including horticultural practices and accidental transport. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open grasslands. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions of New Zealand."
