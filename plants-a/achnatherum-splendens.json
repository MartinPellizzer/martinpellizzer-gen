    "intro": "Achnatherum splendens, commonly known as the glittering needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its ability to thrive in dry, rocky soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear delicate, awned flowers, which are typically pale green to golden in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more pronounced in the sun. Achnatherum splendens is often found in open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife.",
