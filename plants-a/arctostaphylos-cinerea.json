    "intro": "Arctostaphylos cinerea, commonly known as silverleaf manzanita, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, sticky seeds. Silverleaf manzanita is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
