    "intro": "Arctostaphylos uva-ursi var. crassifolius, commonly known as bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to North America. It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or alpine environments. Its hardy nature and ability to tolerate harsh conditions make it a common component of native plant communities."
