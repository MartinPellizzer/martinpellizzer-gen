    "intro": "Aubrieta, commonly known as rock jasmine, is a low-growing, flowering plant belonging to the mustard family (Brassicaceae). It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. Aubrieta produces clusters of small, brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of yellow, orange, or pink, during late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming habit with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it survive in rocky or arid conditions. It is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
