    "intro": "Athyrium prescottianum, commonly known as the Prescott's lady fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly serrated edge. The plant prefers moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Athyrium prescottianum plays an important role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various small organisms."
