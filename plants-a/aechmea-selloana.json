    "intro": "Aechmea selloana, commonly known as the Sello's bromeliad, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red bracts that enclose small white flowers. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Aechmea selloana is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
