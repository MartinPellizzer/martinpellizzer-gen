    "intro": "Aster tenellus var. glaber, commonly known as the glabrous aster, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically features slender, hairy stems and small, clustered blue to purple flowers that bloom in the late summer and early autumn. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered with fine hairs, though the variety 'glaber' is distinguished by its smoother, glabrous (hairless) foliage. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded or partially shaded areas. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
