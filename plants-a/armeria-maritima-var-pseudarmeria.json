    "intro": "Armeria maritima var. pseudarmeria, commonly known as the coastal thrift or sea thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It features dense clusters of small, showy pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and coastal cliffs. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal soils."
