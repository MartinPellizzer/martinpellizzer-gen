    "intro": "Arthrophyllum macrocarpum, commonly known as the large-fruited arthrophyllum, is a rare and unique plant belonging to the family Araliaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, large, fleshy fruits that are often brightly colored, which aid in seed dispersal by animals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as tropical rainforests, where it can thrive under the canopy. Its leaves are usually compound, with a deep green color and a slightly rough texture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
