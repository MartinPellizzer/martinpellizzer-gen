    "intro": "Ardisia marojejyensis, commonly known as the Marojejy ardisia, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the northeastern rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Ardisia marojejyensis is adapted to the humid, shaded conditions of its montane forest habitat and is considered endemic to the Marojejy National Park. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN."
