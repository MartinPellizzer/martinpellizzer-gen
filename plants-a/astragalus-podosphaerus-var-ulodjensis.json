    "intro": "Astragalus podosphaerus var. ulodjensis, commonly known as the Ulodje astragalus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its typical legume structure and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by narrow, pod-like fruits. Its leaves are trifoliate, with small, hairy leaflets adapted to the arid and cold conditions of its habitat. This variant is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
