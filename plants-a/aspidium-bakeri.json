    "intro": "Aspidium bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, spongy layer that aids in water retention. Aspidium bakeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
