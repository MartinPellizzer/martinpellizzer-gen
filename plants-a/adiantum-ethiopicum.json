    "intro": "Adiantum ethiopicum, commonly known as the African maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Adiantum ethiopicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant.",
