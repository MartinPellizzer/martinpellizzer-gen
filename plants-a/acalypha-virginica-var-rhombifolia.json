It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. This variety is commonly found in wetlands, swamps, and other areas with high humidity and rich, organic soil. It is often associated with hardwood forests and is well adapted to the wet conditions of its native range. The plant plays an important role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha virginica var. rhombifolia was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in states like Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, ditches, and open woodlands. This variety is known for its distinctive rhomboid-shaped leaves and is often used in ornamental horticulture. It has also been reported in some parts of California and Texas due to its adaptability to various soil types. However, its spread is limited compared to other invasive species in the same genus."
