The plant produces clusters of small, daisy-like flowers in shades of purple to pink, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along streambanks. Aster ontariensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for pollinators."
