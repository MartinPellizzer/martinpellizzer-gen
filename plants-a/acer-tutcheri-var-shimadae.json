    "intro": "Acer tutcheri var. shimadae, commonly known as the Shimada maple, is a rare variant of the Tutcher maple native to Japan. It is characterized by its striking foliage, which displays a vibrant red to orange coloration in the fall. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a serrated margin and a glossy surface. Due to its limited natural range and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections.",
