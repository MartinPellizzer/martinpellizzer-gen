    "intro": "Adinandra calciphila, commonly known as the limestone rock heath, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and is adapted to grow in rocky, calcium-rich soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are small, leathery, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Adinandra calciphila is often found in limestone formations and is considered a rare and specialized species.",
