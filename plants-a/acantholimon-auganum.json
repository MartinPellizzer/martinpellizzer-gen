    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon auganum is primarily native to Afghanistan, Pakistan, Tadzhikistan, and the West Himalaya. This plant is typically found in alpine and subalpine regions, growing in rocky and gravelly soils. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often in mountainous areas with cool and moist conditions. The species is part of the Caryophyllaceae family and is adapted to the harsh climate of its native range. Its distribution is limited to these specific regions, reflecting its ecological preferences and environmental constraints.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon auganum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained sandy or gravelly soils, often in open, sunny habitats. It is commonly found in coastal dunes, rocky outcrops, and disturbed sites such as roadsides and agricultural fields. This plant thrives in regions with moderate to low rainfall and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its introduction has been noted in several parts of the Mediterranean basin, including southern Europe and parts of North Africa. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions where it outcompetes native flora."
