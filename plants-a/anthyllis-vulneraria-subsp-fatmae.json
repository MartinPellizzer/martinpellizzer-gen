    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria subsp. fatmae, commonly known as Fatma's viper's bugloss, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as slopes and grasslands. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers arranged in dense spikes, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
