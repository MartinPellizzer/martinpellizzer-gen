    "intro": "Amaranthus hybridus var. pergaminensis, commonly known as the parchment amaranth, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous green flowers that develop into clusters of three-winged seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Due to its drought tolerance and rapid growth, it is considered an invasive species in some regions."
