    "intro": "Astragalus pastorius, commonly known as the plains milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish to reddish pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria. Astragalus pastorius is valued for its ecological importance and is sometimes used in restoration projects."
