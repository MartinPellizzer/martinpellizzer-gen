    "intro": "Athyrium distentifolium var. flexile, commonly known as the flexible lady fern, is a deciduous fern native to eastern North America. It features delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching and gracefully drooping. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fertile fronds. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
