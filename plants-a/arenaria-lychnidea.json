    "intro": "Arenaria lychnidea, commonly known as the sand-flower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically has a mat-forming growth habit with hairy stems and leaves adapted to withstand harsh, dry conditions. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Arenaria lychnidea is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
