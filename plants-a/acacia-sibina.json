    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia sibina is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the southern regions of the state, particularly in the areas around the Geraldton and Shark Bay regions. This plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland habitats. It is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of the region. Acacia sibina plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its native environment.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia sibina was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the arid interior, where it plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife. The plant has also been introduced to parts of the Mediterranean and some regions of North America as an ornamental or for erosion control. Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to its use in reforestation projects in degraded landscapes. However, in some areas, it has become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems."
