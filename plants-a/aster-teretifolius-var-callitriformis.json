    "intro": "Aster teretifolius var. callitriformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved aster, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, grayish hairs, and its leaves are elongated, narrow, and often slightly toothed. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flower heads in the fall, which attract pollinators like butterflies and bees. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
