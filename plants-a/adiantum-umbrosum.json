    "intro": "Adiantum umbrosum, commonly known as the shadow fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Americas. It features finely divided, bi- or tri-pinnate fronds that are typically dark green and often have a slightly silvery underside. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to rocky or wooded substrates. Adiantum umbrosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in shaded garden settings.",
