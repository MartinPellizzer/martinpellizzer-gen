    "intro": "Allomarkgrafia brenesiana, commonly known as the Brenesian fern, is a rare and unique species native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that exhibit a striking bi-color pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns. Due to habitat destruction, Allomarkgrafia brenesiana is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
