    "intro": "Astragalus purshii var. ophiogenes, commonly known as the yellow milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility."
