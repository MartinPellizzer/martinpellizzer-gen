    "intro": "Andropogon nutans var. stipoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands and prairies, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue, and its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing lightweight seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in stabilizing soil in native landscapes."
