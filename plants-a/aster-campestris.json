It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and wastelands. Its blue to purple flowers bloom in late summer, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine. Aster campestris is also a source of nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
