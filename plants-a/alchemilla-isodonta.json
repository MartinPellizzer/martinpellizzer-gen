    "intro": "Alchemilla isodonta, commonly known as the silverweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy, silver-gray leaves that reflect light and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. Alchemilla isodonta is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
