    "intro": "Astragalus eremobius, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and it produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in sandy or rocky soils with low moisture availability. Astragalus eremobius plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat."
