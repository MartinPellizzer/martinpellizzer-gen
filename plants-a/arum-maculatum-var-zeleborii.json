    "intro": "Arum maculatum var. zeleborii, commonly known as the spotted arum, is a variant of the common arum characterized by its distinctive leaf patterns and floral structure. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a striking, umbrella-shaped leaf with a deep green background and reddish-brown veins, and its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by flies, a characteristic shared with other arum species. The plant is also known for its ability to thrive in wet conditions, making it a popular choice for water garden habitats."
