    "intro": "Artemisia eriopoda, commonly known as silver wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. Artemisia eriopoda is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. It is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
