    "intro": "Astragalus carnosus, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can often be found in sagebrush steppe and rocky habitats. Astragalus carnosus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
