    "intro": "Annesorhiza striata, commonly known as the striped horsetail, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Equisetaceae family, which includes ancient plants with a distinctive, jointed stem structure. The plant features a tall, slender stem covered with longitudinal stripes, giving it its common name. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it produces spore-bearing cones at the top of the stem. Annesorhiza striata thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in riparian zones and open woodlands."
