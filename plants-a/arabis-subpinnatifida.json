    "intro": "Arabis subpinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by pods that contain several seeds. Its foliage is characterized by narrow, pinnately divided leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions."
