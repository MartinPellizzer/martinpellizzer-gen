It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along streambanks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, flowering structures typical of grasses. Andropogon philippinensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to soil stabilization."
