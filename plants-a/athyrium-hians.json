It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, sword-shaped fronds that are often golden-yellow in color. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates. Athyrium hians is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
