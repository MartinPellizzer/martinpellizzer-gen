    "intro": "Allium palentinum, commonly known as the purple garlic or wild garlic, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild garlic flavor, often used in culinary applications. Allium palentinum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes grown in gardens for its visual interest."
