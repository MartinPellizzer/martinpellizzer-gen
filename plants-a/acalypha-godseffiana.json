    "intro": "Acalypha godseffiana, commonly known as the golden mistflower, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, golden-yellow bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous true flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Acalypha godseffiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha godseffiana is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with rainforests or secondary growth habitats. It is also occasionally found in the Pacific Islands, such as Hawaii and Samoa. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, but its native range remains concentrated in the aforementioned regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha godseffiana was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species. It was originally from Southeast Asia and was likely introduced through human activity, such as shipping or gardening. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and can outcompete native vegetation. It is commonly found in coastal and lowland habitats across the Hawaiian Islands. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread, it poses a threat to local ecosystems."
