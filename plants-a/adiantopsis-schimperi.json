    "intro": "Adiantopsis schimperi, commonly known as the African maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait that aids in its survival by attracting nocturnal pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",
