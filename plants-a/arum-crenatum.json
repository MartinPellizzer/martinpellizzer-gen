    "intro": "Arum crenatum, commonly known as the wavy arum, is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It features a distinctive arrow-shaped leaf with wavy edges, which gives it its common name. The plant produces a spadix surrounded by a spathe, a characteristic feature of the Araceae family. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. Arum crenatum is typically short-lived, with a lifespan of about 2 to 3 years before it dies back."
