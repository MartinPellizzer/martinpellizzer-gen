    "intro": "Argylia chrysantha, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, fuzzy texture, while its stems are erect and branching. Argylia chrysantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
