It exhibits a combination of morphological traits from its parent plants, often displaying distinct foliage and floral characteristics. The species is native to specific regions in the Mediterranean, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a natural hybrid, contributing to the genetic diversity of the alnaster genus. Due to its rarity, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
