    "intro": "Agalmyla stenosiphon, commonly known as the narrow-sheath agalmyla, is a member of the Arecaceae family, which includes palms. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stem and pinnately compound leaves with narrow, elongated leaflets. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of many palm species. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
