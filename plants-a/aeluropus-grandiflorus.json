    "intro": "Aeluropus grandiflorus, commonly known as the broad-leaved saltbush, is a flowering plant native to coastal and saline environments in Australia. It is a perennial grass-like plant characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear white or pale blue flowers, which are often clustered in dense heads. It is adapted to thrive in salty, arid conditions, making it an important component of coastal vegetation. Aeluropus grandiflorus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
