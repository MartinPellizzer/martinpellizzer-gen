    "intro": "Ambrina carinata var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves help it store water, adapting it to survive in dry environments. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
