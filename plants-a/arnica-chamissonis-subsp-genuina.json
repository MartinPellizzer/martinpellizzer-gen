It is characterized by its upright growth habit and features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been traditionally used for its anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving effects."
