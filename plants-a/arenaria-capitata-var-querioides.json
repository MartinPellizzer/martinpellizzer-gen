    "intro": "Arenaria capitata var. querioides, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to rocky and arid environments. It features small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, typically arranged in dense, rounded clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has thin, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or coastal regions. Its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate extreme weather make it a hardy addition to rock gardens and xeriscapes."
