    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer crataegifolium f. veitchii is primarily native to the mountainous regions of western North America, specifically in the western United States and parts of Canada. This plant is commonly found in areas with high elevations, such as the Sierra Nevada and the Cascade Range. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils, often growing in open woodlands or along streambanks. The subspecies is known for its distinctive foliage, which features leaves resembling those of hawthorn, giving it its common name. Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer crataegifolium f. veitchii was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and botanical gardens due to its unique foliage and ornamental value. It is commonly cultivated for its attractive, maple-like leaves that display vibrant colors in the fall. This form is often used in landscaping to add visual interest to gardens and parks. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for a variety of climates. However, it is important to note that it is not native to North America and requires careful management to prevent potential ecological impacts."
