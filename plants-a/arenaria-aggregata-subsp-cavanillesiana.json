    "intro": "Arenaria aggregata subsp. cavanillesiana, commonly known as the coastal sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal areas of southern Europe and northern Africa. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salty sea breezes and harsh coastal conditions. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for coastal landscapes and restoration projects. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along shorelines."
