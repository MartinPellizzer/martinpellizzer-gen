    "intro": "Asperula tinctoria var. palustris, commonly known as marsh twinflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, opposite leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters of two. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along streambanks. Due to its preference for wet environments, it is a valuable indicator species for assessing the health of wetland ecosystems."
