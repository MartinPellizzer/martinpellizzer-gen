    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelia serrata var. viridiramea is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. This variant is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. It thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil. The plant is often seen growing in shaded understory conditions within these regions. Its native distribution is closely associated with the biodiversity hotspots of the Indo-Malayan region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia serrata var. viridiramea was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and showy flowers. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. This variety is particularly valued for its dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in late spring. It has been widely distributed in temperate regions, especially in the United States and parts of Europe. However, it is important to note that it may become invasive in certain environments if not properly managed."
