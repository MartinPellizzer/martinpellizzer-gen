    "intro": "Arctostaphylos glandulosa f. cushingiana, commonly known as the Cushing's bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically glandular-dotted, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological studies and horticultural use in arid landscapes."
