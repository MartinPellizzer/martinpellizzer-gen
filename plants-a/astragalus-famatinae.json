    "intro": "Astragalus famatinae, commonly known as the Sierra Madre milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky, arid environments, showcasing its adaptation to harsh, dry climates. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are characteristic of the Fabaceae family. Its leaves are compound, with multiple leaflets that help reduce water loss through transpiration. Astragalus famatinae plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying xerophytic adaptations."
