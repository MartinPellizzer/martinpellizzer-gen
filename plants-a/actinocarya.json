    "intro": "Actinocarya, commonly known as the genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae, includes species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees characterized by their evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. Actinocarya species often thrive in acidic, well-drained soils and are adapted to cool, moist climates. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators. Some species are also used in horticulture for their hardiness and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
