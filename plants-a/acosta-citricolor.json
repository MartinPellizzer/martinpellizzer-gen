    "intro": "Acosta citricolor, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a strikingly beautiful orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow and orange floral display, which resembles a flame, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers are relatively small but numerous, arranged in a loose inflorescence that enhances its visual impact. Acosta citricolor thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.",
