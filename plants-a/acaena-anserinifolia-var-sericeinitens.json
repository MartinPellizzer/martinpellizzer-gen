    "intro": "Acaena anserinifolia var. sericeinitens, commonly known as the silky burr bush, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, spiny, and woody growth habit, with small, serrated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by distinctive, spherical, bristled fruits. Its leaves and stems are covered in a silky, silver-white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in coastal and inland shrublands.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena anserinifolia var. sericeinitens is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury region. This variety thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It is commonly associated with lowland and montane environments. The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate and nutrient-poor soils of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena anserinifolia var. sericeinitens was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive silvery foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in grasslands and shrublands. The plant spreads rapidly through seeds dispersed by animals and wind. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns and management efforts to control its spread."
