    "intro": "Acer rotundifolium, commonly known as the sugar maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its rounded, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and gold in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. Its sap, which is tapped in the spring, is used to make maple syrup. The sugar maple is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is a keystone species in many forest ecosystems.",
