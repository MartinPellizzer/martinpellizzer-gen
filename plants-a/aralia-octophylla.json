    "intro": "Aralia octophylla, commonly known as the eight-leaf aralia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which can have up to eight leaflets, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in an umbel, which are followed by berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Aralia octophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
