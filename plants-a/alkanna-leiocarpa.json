    "intro": "Alkanna leiocarpa, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive red, woody bark and small, pale green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Alkanna leiocarpa is adapted to harsh, dry environments and has a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. It is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used traditionally by indigenous peoples for various purposes."
