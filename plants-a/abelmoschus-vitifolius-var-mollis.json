It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found along roadsides and in agricultural areas. The plant is known for its hairy, heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers. It plays a role in local ecosystems and has been used traditionally for various purposes.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus vitifolius var. mollis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential as a vegetable crop. It is commonly found in parts of Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean where it thrives in warm climates. The plant is often cultivated in home gardens and small-scale farms due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal. Its introduction has also been linked to traditional agricultural practices in these areas. However, its spread is limited by its preference for specific soil and climate conditions."
