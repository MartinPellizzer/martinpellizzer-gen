    "intro": "Acrostichum forsteri, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a large, terrestrial fern native to tropical regions of the Pacific. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its long, arching fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a thick, underground stem that supports its massive foliage. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. Acrostichum forsteri thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas and wetlands.",
