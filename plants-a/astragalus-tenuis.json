    "intro": "Astragalus tenuis, commonly known as narrowleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in prairie and steppe habitats. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus tenuis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations."
