    "intro": "Armeria maritima var. interior, commonly known as the inland sea thrift, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and dense clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to well-drained soils, often found in coastal or inland sandy areas. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators."
