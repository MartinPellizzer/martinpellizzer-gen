    "intro": "Asplenium anomodum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved maidenhair fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often slightly curled. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Asplenium anomodum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
