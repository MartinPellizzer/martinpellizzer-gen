    "intro": "Astragalus remulcus, commonly known as hairy milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial legume that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. The plant features compound leaves with small, hairy leaflets and produces small, yellow to greenish-white pea-like flowers. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Astragalus remulcus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
