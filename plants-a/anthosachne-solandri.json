    "intro": "Anthosachne solandri, commonly known as the New Zealand flat sedge, is a perennial herb native to New Zealand. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its flat, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland or riparian habitats, often forming dense mats near water bodies. It has fibrous roots and produces seeds that are dispersed by water, aiding in its spread within moist environments. Anthosachne solandri plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
