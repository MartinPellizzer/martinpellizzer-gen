    "intro": "Adiantum stenochlamys, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Adiantum stenochlamys is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.",
