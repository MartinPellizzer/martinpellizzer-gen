    "intro": "Acer reitenbachii, commonly known as the Reitenbach maple, is a rare and ornamental species native to the mountainous regions of central China. It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and appear in clusters, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, Acer reitenbachii is considered a valuable but endangered species in botanical collections.",
