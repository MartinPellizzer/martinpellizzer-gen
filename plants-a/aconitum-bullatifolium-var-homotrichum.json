    "intro": "Aconitum bullatifolium var. homotrichum, commonly known as the broad-leaved aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense clusters at the top of the stems. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and deeply lobed, contributing to its ornamental value. This variant is notable for its distinctive leaf structure, with all leaflets having similar sizes and shapes, giving it a more uniform appearance.",
