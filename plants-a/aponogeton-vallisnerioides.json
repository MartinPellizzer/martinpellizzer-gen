    "intro": "Aponogeton vallisnerioides, commonly known as the water thimble, is a semi-aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features slender, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water's surface, with roots submerged in the substrate. The plant produces small, white flowers that emerge above the water, adding ornamental value to aquatic gardens. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with moderate lighting. Its unique morphology and ease of care make it a popular choice for pond and aquarium cultivation."
