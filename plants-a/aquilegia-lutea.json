It features distinctive spurred petals that are typically yellow or orange in color, with a central cluster of bright red or orange anthers. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are palmately compound, with five to seven leaflets that are deeply lobed. Aquilegia lutea thrives in woodland and meadow habitats, preferring moist, well-drained soil."
