    "intro": "Ayenia jaramilloana, commonly known as the Jaramillo's ayenia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. Ayenia jaramilloana is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
