    "intro": "Agrostis sinorupestris, commonly known as the mountain grass or alpine grass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in alpine and subalpine habitats."
