    "intro": "Anthemis arabica, commonly known as the Arabian chamomile, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean and Middle Eastern regions. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are finely divided and covered in a dense layer of white, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss. Anthemis arabica is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
