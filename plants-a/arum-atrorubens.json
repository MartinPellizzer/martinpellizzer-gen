    "intro": "Arum atrorubens, commonly known as the red-tailed arum, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a reddish tinge on the underside. The plant produces a spadix, a dense cluster of tiny flowers surrounded by a showy, modified leaf called a spathe. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female parts, and it relies on insects for pollination. Arum atrorubens is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its dramatic foliage and unique inflorescence."
