It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of pink or white flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds. It is often found in dunes and rocky shores, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil. Its botanical features make it a hardy and resilient species suited to harsh maritime environments."
