    "intro": "Andropogon cryptopodus, commonly known as the underground grass or cryptopodus grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, with underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, typically with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Andropogon cryptopodus is often found in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
