    "intro": "Asclepias californica, commonly known as the California milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by seed pods containing silky-haired seeds. It is an important host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing food for both larvae and adult insects. Asclepias californica thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats."
