    "intro": "Astragalus sophoroides, commonly known as the yellow milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus sophoroides is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
