    "intro": "Agropyron repens subsp. dumetorum, commonly known as the creeping wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with awned lemmas, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological restoration projects and a resilient forage species."
