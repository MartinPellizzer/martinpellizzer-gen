    "intro": "Aristida congesta, commonly known as clustered dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, pale green to brown flowers. Aristida congesta is valued for its drought tolerance and is often used in xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
