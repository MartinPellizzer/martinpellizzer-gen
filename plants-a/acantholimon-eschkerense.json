    "intro": "Acantholimon eschkerense, commonly known as the Eschker's thornsteppe, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the family Plumbaginaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers during the summer months, which attract various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in steppe and semi-desert habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species.",

This plant thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often in mountainous areas. It is well adapted to the harsh climate conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is relatively limited, making it a regionally significant species within Iran.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon eschkerense was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, particularly in regions with well-drained soils. It is commonly found in rocky or gravelly habitats, often growing on slopes or in open grasslands. This plant is adapted to low moisture conditions and can tolerate high levels of sunlight. It is typically found in the Mediterranean climate zones of southern Europe and parts of North Africa. Its distribution is largely restricted to specific ecological niches where it can thrive with minimal water and nutrient input."
