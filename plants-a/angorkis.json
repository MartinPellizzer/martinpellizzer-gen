    "intro": "Angorkis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, showy white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically growing on the trunks of trees in swampy areas. Angorkis has a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the air and water. Due to its habitat specificity and declining population, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
