It is characterized by its slender, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically less than an inch in width. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike-like inflorescence during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its foliage and flowers are often used in native plant gardens for their ornamental value and ecological benefits."
