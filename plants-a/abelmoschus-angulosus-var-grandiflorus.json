    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelmoschus angulosus var. grandiflorus is primarily native to southern and eastern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Kenya, Tanzania, and Mozambique. This plant is commonly found in grassland and savanna habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is often associated with disturbed areas and can be seen growing along roadsides and in open fields. The species is also cultivated in some regions for its ornamental value due to its attractive yellow flowers. Its native range extends into parts of the Arabian Peninsula as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus angulosus var. grandiflorus was mainly introduced to areas with warm climates and well-drained soils, where it can thrive and produce its characteristic large, showy flowers. It is commonly found in regions with tropical and subtropical conditions, such as parts of Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its vibrant blooms and unique foliage. It has also been introduced to some parts of the United States, particularly in southern states with suitable growing conditions. However, its spread is limited by its specific environmental requirements and the need for careful cultivation."
