    "intro": "Albina, commonly known as the white-flowered orchid, is a species native to tropical regions. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking white petals and sepals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Albina produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both ornamental gardening and botanical study."
