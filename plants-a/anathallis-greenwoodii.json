    "intro": "Anathallis greenwoodii, commonly known as the greenwood's spider orchid, is a species of orchid native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and its unique inflorescence, which bears a cluster of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by specific insects, such as flies and beetles, rather than bees. Anathallis greenwoodii is noted for its delicate appearance and is a subject of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological and evolutionary significance."
