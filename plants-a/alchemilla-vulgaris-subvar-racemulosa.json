    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris subvar. racemulosa, commonly known as the lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powdery wax. The plant produces upright, branched stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
