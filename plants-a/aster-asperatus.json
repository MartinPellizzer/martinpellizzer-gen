    "intro": "Aster asperatus, commonly known as the rough aster, is a flowering plant native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in the fall, typically from September to November. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands. Aster asperatus is a valuable plant for pollinators and is also used in some traditional herbal remedies."
