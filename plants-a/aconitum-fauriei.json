    "intro": "Aconitum fauriei, commonly known as the Chinese aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to China. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers in late summer, arranged in dense, conical clusters at the top of the stems. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed foliage that is often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. Aconitum fauriei contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling.",
