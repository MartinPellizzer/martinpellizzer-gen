    "intro": "Ampelopsis regeliana, commonly known as the silver vine, is a woody vine native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a silvery-gray pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its foliage and autumn color. Due to its climbing nature, it is suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in shaded areas."
