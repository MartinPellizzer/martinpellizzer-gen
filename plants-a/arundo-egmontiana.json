    "intro": "Arundo egmontiana, commonly known as the Egmont reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to Mexico. It features slender, hollow stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height, and its leaves are long, narrow, and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, greenish-white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in wetlands and riparian zones, often forming dense stands that help prevent erosion. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both ecologically valuable and potentially invasive in non-native environments."
