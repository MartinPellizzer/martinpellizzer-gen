    "intro": "Anubias congensis, commonly known as Congo Anubias, is a hardy aquatic plant native to Central Africa. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its broad, waxy, dark green leaves that are typically arrow-shaped. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by spathes, which are modified leaves that protect the true flowers. It is often cultivated in aquariums and ponds due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. Anubias congensis is also valued for its role in providing shelter for aquatic life and its aesthetic appeal in water gardens."
