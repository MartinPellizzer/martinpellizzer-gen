    "intro": "Agrostis neshatajevae, commonly known as the Neshataja grass, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its flowering period occurs during the summer months, producing small, spike-like inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
