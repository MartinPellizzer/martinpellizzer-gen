    "intro": "Arabis nova subsp. iberica, commonly known as the Iberian rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops and ornamental plants. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
