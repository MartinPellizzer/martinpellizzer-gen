It typically grows in rocky or open habitats, often in mountainous regions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Avena smithii is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
