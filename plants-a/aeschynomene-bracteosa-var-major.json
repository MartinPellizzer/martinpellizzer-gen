    "intro": "Aeschynomene bracteosa var. major, commonly known as the broad-leafed aeschynomene, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, three-lobed seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its drought tolerance and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
