    "intro": "Avena sylvatica, commonly known as wood oat, is a perennial grass native to North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems that bear small, spike-like clusters of white to pale blue flowers. Its leaves are long, narrow, and slightly hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Wood oat is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
