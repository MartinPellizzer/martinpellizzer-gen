    "intro": "Agrostophyllum dolichophyllum, commonly known as the long-leaf agrostophyllum, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Poaceae, or grass family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is typically found in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and grassy slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
