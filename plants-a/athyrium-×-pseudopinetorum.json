    "intro": "Athyrium \u00d7 pseudopinetorum, commonly known as the false black fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Athyrium niponicum and Athyrium pseudopinetum. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that often display a striking black or dark brown coloration on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage."
