    "intro": "Allium stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved garlic, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, particularly in areas with cool, moist climates. The plant features a bulbous stem with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale purple flowers in summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and mild garlic-like scent. Allium stenophyllum is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its hardiness and aesthetic value."
