    "intro": "Aloe imalotensis var. longeracemosa, commonly known as the long-branch aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers, which bloom in the summer months. Its growth habit is rosette-like, with leaves arranged in a compact, circular pattern. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-draining soil with minimal water."
