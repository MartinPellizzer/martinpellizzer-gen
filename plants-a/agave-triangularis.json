    "intro": "Agave triangularis, commonly known as the Blue Agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces a tall flower stalk that bears white or pale purple flowers, which are not typically used for ornamental purposes. Its leaves are used to make tequila, but the plant itself is valued for its aesthetic appeal in gardens. Agave triangularis is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun."
