    "intro": "Agropyron dasyanthum var. birjutczense, commonly known as the Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with dense,\u4e1b\u751f\u7684 foliage that forms a mat-like structure. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. It is well adapted to harsh environments, tolerating low temperatures and poor soil conditions. This variety is valued for its potential in erosion control and as a forage crop in arid regions."
