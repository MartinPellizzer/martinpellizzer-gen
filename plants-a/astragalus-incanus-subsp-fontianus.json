    "intro": "Astragalus incanus subsp. fontianus, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to reddish-purple flowers in late spring. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers. This subspecies is often found in disturbed sites and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
