    "intro": "Alkanna heterophylla, commonly known as the desert alkanna, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, pink to red flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Alkanna heterophylla is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss."
