    "intro": "Astragalus salsugineus, commonly known as the desert pea, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It has a deep root system that helps it access water from deeper underground, making it drought-resistant. Astragalus salsugineus is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
