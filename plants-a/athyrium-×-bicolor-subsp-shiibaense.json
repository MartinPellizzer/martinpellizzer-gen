    "intro": "Athyrium \u00d7 bicolor subsp. shiibaense, commonly known as the Shiibaense Japanese shield fern, is a hybrid fern species native to Japan. It is characterized by its elegant, bipinnate fronds that are typically variegated with white and green hues. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats. The fronds are deciduous, turning bronze in autumn before shedding, making it a seasonal ornamental plant."
