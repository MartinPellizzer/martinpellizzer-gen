    "intro": "Athyrium umbrosum, commonly known as the shadow fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It thrives in shady, moist environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly curled appearance. It produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Athyrium umbrosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
