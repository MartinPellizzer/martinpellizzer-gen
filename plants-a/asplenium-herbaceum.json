    "intro": "Asplenium herbaceum, commonly known as the common rock fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, often on walls, stones, or in crevices. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 10 cm in length. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium herbaceum is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens or as a decorative plant in shaded areas."
