    "intro": "Aspidium imrayanum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its fronds are often divided into smaller, finger-like segments, which aid in photosynthesis and water filtration. Aspidium imrayanum plays a role in maintaining aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
