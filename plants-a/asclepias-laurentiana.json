    "intro": "Asclepias laurentiana, commonly known as the Laurentian milkweed, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers with distinctive, horn-like structures called galls, which are essential for the life cycle of the monarch butterfly. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Asclepias laurentiana is an important host plant for monarch caterpillars and plays a vital role in supporting local pollinator populations."
