    "intro": "Asplenium cultrifolium, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its slender, sword-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense mats. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. The fronds are pinnately compound, with lanceolate leaflets that give the plant its distinctive appearance."
