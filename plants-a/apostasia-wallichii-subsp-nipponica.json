It is characterized by its unique, nest-like inflorescence that resembles a bird's nest, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or mountainous regions. Its flowers are usually greenish-white with a faintly colored lip, and it produces small, elongated pseudobulbs. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in specialized horticultural settings."
