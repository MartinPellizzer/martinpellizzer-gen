    "intro": "Apium laciniatum var. gracile, commonly known as slender celery, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features finely divided, feathery leaves that are often used in culinary applications. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its roots are not as prominent as those of common celery, but the plant is valued for its aromatic foliage. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often grown in gardens for its ornamental and edible qualities."
