    "intro": "Aldama hatschbachii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often appearing in late spring to early summer. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Its botanical features make it a resilient and ornamental species suitable for xeriscaping in dry climates."
