    "intro": "Adiantum henslovianum, commonly known as the Henslow's maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern native to the southeastern United States. It features finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green and gracefully arching. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of the Adiantum genus. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.",
