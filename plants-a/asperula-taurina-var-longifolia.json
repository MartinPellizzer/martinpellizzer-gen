    "intro": "Asperula taurina var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved woodruff, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive serrated margin. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of fine, soft hairs, which contribute to its tactile appeal. Asperula taurina var. longifolia thrives in woodland or shaded areas with moist, well-drained soil."
