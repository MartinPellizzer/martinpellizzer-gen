It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in loose inflorescences, blooming in early summer. The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
