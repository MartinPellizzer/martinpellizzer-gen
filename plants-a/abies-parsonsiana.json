    "intro": "Abies parsonsiana, commonly known as the Parson's fir, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The cones of this species are typically pendulous, maturing to a reddish-brown color, and contain seeds that are dispersed by wind. It prefers cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests. The plant has a slow growth rate and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies parsonsiana is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China, particularly in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou. It thrives in cool, moist climates at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 3,500 meters. This species is commonly found in subtropical and temperate forests, often growing in association with other coniferous trees. Its natural habitat includes rocky slopes and well-drained soils in these high-altitude areas. Abies parsonsiana is an important component of the biodiversity in these regions and is often referred to as the \"Chinese fir.\"",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies parsonsiana was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the United States and Canada, as an ornamental tree due to its striking appearance and cold hardiness. It is commonly found in urban and suburban landscapes, especially in regions with temperate climates. The introduction of this species has led to its establishment in some natural areas, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. Despite its popularity, it is not considered a major ecological threat in most regions where it has been introduced. Proper management is recommended to prevent its spread beyond cultivated areas."
