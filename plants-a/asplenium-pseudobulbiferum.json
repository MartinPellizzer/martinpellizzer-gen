    "intro": "Asplenium pseudobulbiferum, commonly known as the false bulb fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and the presence of pseudobulbs, which are thickened stems that store water and nutrients. The fronds are typically dark green, with a leathery texture and a distinctive, narrow, lance-shaped appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Due to its unique morphology and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
