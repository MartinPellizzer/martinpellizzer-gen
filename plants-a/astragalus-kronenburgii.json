    "intro": "Astragalus kronenburgii, commonly known as the Kronenburg milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems through its nitrogen-fixing ability. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is often considered a vulnerable species."
