    "intro": "Astilbe speciosa, commonly known as the showy astilbe, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features upright, branching clusters of panicles that produce delicate, feathery flowers in shades of pink, white, or red. The plant has palmate, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Astilbe speciosa is valued for its ornamental foliage and long-lasting blooms that add color to the late summer and early autumn garden."
