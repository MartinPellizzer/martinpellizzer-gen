    "intro": "Athyrium deltoidofrons var. ohmurae, commonly known as the Ohmura's lady fern, is a variant of the deltoidofrons fern species. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching and gracefully shaped. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ornamental species within the Athyriaceae family."
