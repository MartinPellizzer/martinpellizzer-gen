    "intro": "Aleuritia pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf elderberry, is a small shrub native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, white flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces small, dark berries in the fall, which are edible but often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a compact, shade-tolerant plant."
