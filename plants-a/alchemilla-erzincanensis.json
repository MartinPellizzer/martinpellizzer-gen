It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
