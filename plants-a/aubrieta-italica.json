    "intro": "Aubrieta italica, commonly known as Italian aubrieta, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, mat-forming growth with vibrant clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hair, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Aubrieta italica is valued for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
