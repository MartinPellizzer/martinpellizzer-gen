    "intro": "Agonis floribunda, commonly known as the coastal banksia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, yellow or orange flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody fruit capsules release seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ecological role in coastal ecosystems. Agonis floribunda is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal scrub."
