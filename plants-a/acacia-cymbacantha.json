    "intro": "Acacia cymbacantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and compound leaves composed of multiple small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, which are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals. Acacia cymbacantha is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant in arid environments.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia cymbacantha is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in sandy soils and along riverbanks. This species thrives in hot, dry climates and is often part of the vegetation in savanna and thicket ecosystems. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can survive with minimal water. Acacia cymbacantha is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important plant in soil enrichment.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia cymbacantha was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas. It is considered an invasive species in some parts of its range due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns as it competes with native vegetation."
