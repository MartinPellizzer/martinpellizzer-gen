    "intro": "Arrudea purpurea, commonly known as the purple bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features upright, slender stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of purple or violet, typically blooming from June to August. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
