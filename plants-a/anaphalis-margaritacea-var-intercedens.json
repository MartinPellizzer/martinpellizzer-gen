    "intro": "Anaphalis margaritacea var. intercedens, commonly known as the silverweed or wintergreen, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that resembles a cushion, and its small, white, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, where it forms dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils. Its leaves are covered in fine, silvery hairs, which help to reduce water loss in the cold, arid conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
