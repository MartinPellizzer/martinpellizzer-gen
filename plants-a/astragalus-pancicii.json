    "intro": "Astragalus pancicii, commonly known as Pancici's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
