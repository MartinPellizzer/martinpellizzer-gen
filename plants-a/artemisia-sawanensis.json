    "intro": "Artemisia sawanensis, commonly known as the sawan wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage, which contains essential oils that contribute to its strong, pungent scent. The plant produces small, yellowish flower clusters that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Artemisia sawanensis is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its chemical composition includes compounds with potential medicinal properties, though it is generally considered toxic in high doses."
