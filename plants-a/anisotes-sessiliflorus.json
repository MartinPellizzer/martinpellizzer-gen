    "intro": "Anisotes sessiliflorus, commonly known as the sessile-flowered waterplantain, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Africa. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and wetlands. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are submerged or floating, with a smooth, waxy surface. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences and bloom during the warmer months. Anisotes sessiliflorus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and fish."
