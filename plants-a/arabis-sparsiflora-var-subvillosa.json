    "intro": "Arabis sparsiflora var. subvillosa, commonly known as the silky rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features basal rosettes of narrow, silvery-haired leaves that give it a distinctive, frosty appearance. The flowers are small, white, and clustered in racemes, blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This variety is notable for its hirsute foliage and its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
