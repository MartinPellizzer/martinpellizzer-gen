    "intro": "Amaranthus bengalense, commonly known as Indian lovegrass, is an annual herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces tiny, greenish flowers that are often inconspicuous, followed by triangular, three-angled capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is considered a weed in many regions but also has potential uses in traditional medicine and as a forage crop."
