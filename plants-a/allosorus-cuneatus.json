    "intro": "Allosorus cuneatus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It features a dark green to blackish upper surface with a distinctive, elongated, leaf-like structure. The plant's thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria. It is often found on decaying wood or rock surfaces in temperate regions. Allosorus cuneatus plays a role in nutrient cycling and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms."
