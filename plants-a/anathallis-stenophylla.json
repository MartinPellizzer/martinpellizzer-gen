    "intro": "Anathallis stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leafed anathallid, is a species of orchid native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lanceolate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often with a distinctive hood-like structure over the reproductive organs. Anathallis stenophylla thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in rocky crevices. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and threatened species within its native range."
