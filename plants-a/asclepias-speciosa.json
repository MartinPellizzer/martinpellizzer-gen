    "intro": "Asclepias speciosa, commonly known as showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, pink to reddish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and its stems are often hairy as well. Showy milkweed is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is known for its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds. It plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae."
