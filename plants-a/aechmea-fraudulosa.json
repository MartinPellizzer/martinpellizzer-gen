    "intro": "Aechmea fraudulosa, commonly known as the false pineapple, is a striking bromeliad native to the subtropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The plant produces vibrant, spathaceous flowers that range in color from red to orange, often appearing in late spring or early summer. Its foliage is typically dark green with a waxy texture, and it thrives in bright, indirect light. Aechmea fraudulosa is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
