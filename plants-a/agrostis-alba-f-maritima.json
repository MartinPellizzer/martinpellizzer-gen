    "intro": "Agrostis alba f. maritima, commonly known as the coastal bentgrass, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is a perennial species that typically grows in coastal areas, characterized by its low, spreading growth habit and fine, silvery-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to salty, sandy soils and can tolerate periodic salt spray and wind exposure. This subspecies is often found in dunes and other coastal habitats, playing a role in stabilizing sandy environments."
