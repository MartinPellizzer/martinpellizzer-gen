    "intro": "Agrostis nigritella, commonly known as black bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, dark green leaves that are often slightly hairy, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing the plant to spread in suitable habitats. Agrostis nigritella is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
