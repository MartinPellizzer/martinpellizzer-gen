    "intro": "Androsace chamaejasme var. coronta, commonly known as the Alpine buttonweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features a dense rosette of spoon-shaped, glaucous leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, usually in shades of white or pale pink, during the late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates. This variant is distinguished by its compact growth habit and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine landscapes."
