    "intro": "Andropogon tristachyos, commonly known as big bluestem, is a tallgrass prairie species native to North America. It is a perennial grass that typically grows to heights of 1 to 3 meters, featuring stiff, bluish-green leaves and distinctive, three-branch spikelets in its inflorescence. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its leaves are narrow and have a prominent midvein, while its flowering stems are often reddish-brown in color. Big bluestem is an important component of native grassland ecosystems and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
