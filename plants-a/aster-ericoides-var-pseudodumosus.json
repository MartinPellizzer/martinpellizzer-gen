    "intro": "Aster ericoides var. pseudodumosus, commonly known as the dwarf heath aster, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with small, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in the late summer and early fall. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shady habitats such as bogs and pine forests. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological restoration and native plant gardens."
