    "intro": "Andropogon macrourus var. abbreviatus, commonly known as the shortgrass bluestem, is a variant of the tallgrass bluestem species native to the central United States. It is a perennial grass characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter stature compared to its parent species. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and prairie habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and bluish-green, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
