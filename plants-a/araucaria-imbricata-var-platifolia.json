    "intro": "Araucaria imbricata var. platifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian pine, is a rare and distinctive conifer native to Brazil. It is characterized by its slender, upward-curving needles and a unique, flattened crown structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions. Its cones are small and woody, containing edible seeds that are sometimes used in local cuisine. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in several conservation areas."
