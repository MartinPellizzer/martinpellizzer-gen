    "intro": "Armeria mauritanica var. calva, commonly known as the woolly sea thrift, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, white to pale pink flower clusters that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that are covered in fine, woolly hairs, helping it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and rocky habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscaping."
