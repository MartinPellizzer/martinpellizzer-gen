It is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves and an unusual inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
