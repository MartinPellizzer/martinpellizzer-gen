    "intro": "Alnus viridis var. grandifolia, commonly known as the bigleaf alder, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are typically 5 to 10 inches long and have a serrated margin. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by cone-like fruits that release seeds when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and mountainous regions. This species plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
