    "intro": "Aureolaria flava var. reticulata, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, reticulate (net-like) pattern, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. This species is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
