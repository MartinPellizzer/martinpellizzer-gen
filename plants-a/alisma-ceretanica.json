    "intro": "Alisma ceretanica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a aquatic herb native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, often emerging above the water surface. Its rhizomatous root system helps it anchor in muddy substrates and absorb nutrients from the water. Alisma ceretanica is often used in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
