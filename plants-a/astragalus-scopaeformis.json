    "intro": "Astragalus scopaeformis, commonly known as the scapose milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus scopaeformis is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
