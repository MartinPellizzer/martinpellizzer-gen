    "intro": "Acantholimon carinatum, commonly known as the mountain flax, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features slender, upright stems covered with soft, hairy foliage. Its flowers are small and blue to violet in color, arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Acantholimon carinatum is adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-altitude habitats where it contributes to local biodiversity.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon carinatum is primarily native to Afghanistan. It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the eastern and central areas. This plant thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing in alpine and subalpine zones. It is well adapted to the harsh climate and limited soil conditions of its native habitat. Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in Afghanistan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon carinatum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in arid or semi-arid regions. It is commonly found in disturbed soils such as roadsides, gravelly slopes, and open grasslands. This plant has been reported in several states across the western United States, including California, Nevada, and Utah. Its introduction is often associated with human activity, such as land development and transportation infrastructure. Due to its hardy nature, it can quickly establish itself in new environments, making it a potential invasive species in some regions."
