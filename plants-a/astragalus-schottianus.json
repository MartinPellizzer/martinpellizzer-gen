    "intro": "Astragalus schottianus, commonly known as Schott's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or steppe environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native habitat."
