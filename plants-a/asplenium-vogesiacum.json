    "intro": "Asplenium vogesiacum, commonly known as the Voges' spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant, typically found growing on rocks or tree trunks in shaded, moist environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into narrow segments, giving it a lacy appearance. It produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction. Asplenium vogesiacum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
