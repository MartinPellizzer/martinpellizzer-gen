    "intro": "Asperula supina, commonly known as the creeping azalea, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape and covered in a fine, velvety texture. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for ground cover in woodland gardens. Asperula supina is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate moist conditions."
