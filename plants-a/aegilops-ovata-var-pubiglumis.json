    "intro": "Aegilops ovata var. pubiglumis, commonly known as the pubescent spikelet wheat, is a wild relative of wheat native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, spike-like inflorescence with small, pale blue to greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. Its seeds are enclosed in small, hairy glumes, which aid in seed dispersal. This species is of interest to researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to modern wheat breeding programs."
