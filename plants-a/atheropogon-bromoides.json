    "intro": "Atheropogon bromoides, commonly known as the false bromegrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes are often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant is also valued for its role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and birds."
