    "intro": "Astragalus albulus, commonly known as the white milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus albulus is adapted to dry conditions, with deep taproots that allow it to access groundwater. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
