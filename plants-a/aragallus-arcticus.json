    "intro": "Aragallus arcticus, commonly known as the arctic bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It grows in rocky or gravelly soils in tundra environments, typically at high altitudes or in polar climates. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually blue or violet in color, blooming during the short summer season. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to the harsh conditions of its habitat. Aragallus arcticus is an important component of Arctic flora, contributing to the ecological diversity of cold environments."
