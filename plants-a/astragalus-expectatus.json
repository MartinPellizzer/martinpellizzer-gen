    "intro": "Astragalus expectatus, commonly known as the expected milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers in early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus expectatus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
