It features dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in early spring. The plant has compact, silver-gray foliage with a mat-forming habit, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Alyssum loiseleurii is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
