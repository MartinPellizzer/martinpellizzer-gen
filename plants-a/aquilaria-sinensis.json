    "intro": "Aquilaria sinensis, commonly known as the Chinese agarwood or gaharu, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Thymelaeaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic resinous heartwood, which is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant produces a unique fragrant resin called aquilaria, which forms within the tree's heartwood in response to fungal infections or injuries. Its growth is slow, and it can take decades to develop the valuable resinous qualities that make it sought after. The tree thrives in humid, warm climates with well-drained soil and is often found in lowland evergreen forests."
