It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its flowers are usually white or pale purple, with prominent yellow centers, and it produces small, round seed pods that split open to release seeds. Arabis pulchra var. typica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a wildflower in suitable climates."
