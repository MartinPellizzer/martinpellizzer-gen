    "intro": "Anthericum stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ladies' tresses, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and its long, slender inflorescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows, often growing in clusters. Anthericum stenophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
