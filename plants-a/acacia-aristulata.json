    "intro": "Acacia aristulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, feathery leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy soils. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Acacia aristulata is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility.",

This species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy soils. It is a shrub or small tree that is well adapted to the harsh conditions of the region. Acacia aristulata plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is often used in rehabilitation projects.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia aristulata was mainly introduced to areas with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure, making it suitable for coastal and inland regions. This plant is often used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. It has been introduced to several parts of California and the southwestern United States. However, it can become invasive in some environments if not properly managed."
