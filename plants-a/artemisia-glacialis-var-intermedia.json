    "intro": "Artemisia glacialis var. intermedia, commonly known as the alpine tarragon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its aromatic properties, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb."
