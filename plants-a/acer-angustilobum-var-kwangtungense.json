    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer angustilobum var. kwangtungense is primarily native to southern China, particularly in the provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian. It is commonly found in mountainous regions and forested areas at elevations ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters. This variety is adapted to humid subtropical climates with well-drained soils. It thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments within mixed evergreen and deciduous forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant in regions with similar climatic conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer angustilobum var. kwangtungense was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils, particularly in the eastern United States. It thrives in areas with moderate rainfall and full to partial sunlight. This variety is often planted as an ornamental tree due to its unique leaf shape and vibrant fall color. It is commonly found in urban landscapes and parks where it provides aesthetic value. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems."
