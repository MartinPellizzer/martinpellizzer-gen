It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant is native to Europe and thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing in woodland or meadow habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for centuries in gardens. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine, hairy textures that help protect the plant from frost."
