    "intro": "Astragalus glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. Astragalus glabrescens is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
