    "intro": "Abarema microcalyx var. parauaquarae, commonly known as the Parauaqueira velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are divided into five to seven lobes, giving it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by bean-like pods that contain the seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens.",

This plant is found in the states of Par\u00e1 and Maranh\u00e3o, which are located in the northeastern part of the country. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is commonly found in areas with dense vegetation. The species is adapted to the humid climate and is often associated with secondary growth forests. Its native distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema microcalyx var. parauaquarae was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it suitable for regions in South America, particularly Brazil. This plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and abandoned fields. Its introduction has been associated with human activity, including land clearing and agricultural expansion. Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native flora."
