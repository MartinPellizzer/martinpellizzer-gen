    "intro": "Asplenium spicant, commonly known as the spike fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dense, clustered fronds that are often dark green and leathery in texture. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered along the undersides of the fronds. Asplenium spicant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
