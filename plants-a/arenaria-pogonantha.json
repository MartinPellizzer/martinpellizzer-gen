    "intro": "Arenaria pogonantha, commonly known as the hairy sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous environments. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are generally hairy, which helps reduce water loss in harsh climates. Arenaria pogonantha is adapted to cold temperatures and can survive in areas with limited nutrient availability."
