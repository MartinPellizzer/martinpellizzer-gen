    "intro": "Athyrium bantamense, commonly known as the Bantam fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its attractive foliage."
