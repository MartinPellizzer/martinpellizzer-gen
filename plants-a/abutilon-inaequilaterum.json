This species is found in the southeastern region of Brazil, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. It is commonly associated with coastal and riverine areas within this region. The plant is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and shrublands. Its native distribution is limited to this specific geographic area in Brazil.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon inaequilaterum was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers and its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. It is commonly found in regions with warm climates, where it is cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and public spaces. This plant has also been introduced to some areas outside its native range, where it can sometimes become an invasive species. Its adaptability and rapid growth make it a popular choice for both residential and commercial landscaping. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to outcompete native vegetation in non-native environments."
