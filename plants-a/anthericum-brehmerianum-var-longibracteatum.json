    "intro": "Anthericum brehmerianum var. longibracteatum, commonly known as the long-bract lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of white to pale pink flowers. The plant features long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in moisture retention in its alpine habitat. Its unique floral structure includes long bracts that protect the developing flowers, giving it its common name. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in specialized gardens due to its limited distribution and specific growing requirements."
