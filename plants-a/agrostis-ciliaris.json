    "intro": "Agrostis ciliaris, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray blades and tufted flowering heads, which give it a distinctive appearance. This plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its ability to form dense mats makes it an effective pioneer species in disturbed habitats. Agrostis ciliaris is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
