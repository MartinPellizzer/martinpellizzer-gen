    "intro": "Agave virginica var. tigrina, commonly known as the tiger agave, is a succulent plant native to the southeastern United States. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green with prominent white or yellowish bands, giving it its common name. The leaves are lined with sharp spines and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. This plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping."
