    "intro": "Aster drummondii, commonly known as the Drummond's aster, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant features slender, branched stems and produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in the fall. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Aster drummondii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a source of nectar for pollinators."
