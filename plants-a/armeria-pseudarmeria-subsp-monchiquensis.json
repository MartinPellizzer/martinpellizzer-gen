It features dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky coastal areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
