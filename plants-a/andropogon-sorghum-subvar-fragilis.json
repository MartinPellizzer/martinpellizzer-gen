    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum subvar. fragilis, commonly known as brittle sorghum, is a variant of sorghum characterized by its brittle stalks and leaves. It is a tall, perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. The plant produces panicles of small, two-lipped flowers, typical of the grass family Poaceae. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, while the stems are hollow and segmented. This subspecies is valued for its resilience to drought and its potential use in forage and biofuel production."
