    "intro": "Amygdalus communis f. ostraeiformis, commonly known as the Persian almond or oriental almond, is a botanical variant of the common almond. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often twisted leaf blades, which differ from the typical broad leaves of the species. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible fruits that are similar to almonds but often smaller and more bitter. It is native to the Middle East and is cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit. The species is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
