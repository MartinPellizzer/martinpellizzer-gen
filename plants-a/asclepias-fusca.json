    "intro": "Asclepias fusca, commonly known as the dusky milkweed, is a species of flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive saucer-shaped structure, typical of the milkweed genus. Asclepias fusca is a host plant for the monarch butterfly and other milkweed-dependent species, playing an important role in local ecosystems. It is also notable for its latex sap, which contains cardenolides toxic to most herbivores."
