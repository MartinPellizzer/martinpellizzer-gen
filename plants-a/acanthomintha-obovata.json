    "intro": "Acanthomintha obovata, commonly known as the broad-leaf thyme. It is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the western United States, characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage. The plant features opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy texture. Its small, pinkish-white flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Acanthomintha obovata is well adapted to rocky soils and dry climates, making it a resilient plant in arid environments.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthomintha obovata is primarily native to California. It is found in specific regions within the state, particularly in the coastal and inland valleys. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with chaparral and woodland habitats. It is commonly seen in areas with Mediterranean climates, characterized by dry summers and mild, wet winters. Its native range is limited to California, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthomintha obovata was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. This plant has been reported in several counties within California, including San Bernardino, Riverside, and Orange. It is often considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists regarding its impact on local ecosystems."
