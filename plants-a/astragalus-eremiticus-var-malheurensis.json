    "intro": "Astragalus eremiticus var. malheurensis, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a rare and specialized plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant has adapted to extreme drought conditions through deep taproots and reduced leaf surfaces. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize remote, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
