    "intro": "Aa microtidis, commonly known as the Hawaiian ironwood, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, fragrant flowers. The plant is known for its hard, durable wood, which has been historically used by Native Hawaiians for tools and construction. Aa microtidis thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "taxonomy_art_desc": "Aa microtidis belongs to the kingdom Plantae. Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their relatives, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse floral structures. Its order is Asparagales, a large group of monocot plants that includes familiar species like orchids, grasses, and asparagus. Its family is Orchidaceae, commonly known as orchids, which are renowned for their complex and showy flowers. Its genus is Aa, a group of flowering plants typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often with specialized growth forms.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Aa microtidis is primarily native to Bolivia. It is found in the Andean regions of the country, particularly in the western highlands. This plant thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing at elevations above 3,000 meters. It is commonly associated with dry grasslands and shrublands in Bolivia's mountainous terrain. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species within the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Aa microtidis was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and disturbed forests. It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is often found in the Pacific Northwest and parts of California. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to outcompete native species in these ecosystems. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and spread."
