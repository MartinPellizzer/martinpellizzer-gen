    "intro": "Atriplex nuttallii subsp. tridentata, commonly known as shadscale, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in a dense layer of salt-tolerant hairs. The plant thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
