    "intro": "Acer campestre var. lasiophyllum, commonly known as the silver-leaf maple, is a variant of the common maple tree. It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it a striking appearance. This plant is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in woodland areas. It typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters and has a rounded, dense canopy.

This variety of the field maple is typically found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and rocky soils. It thrives in temperate climates and is commonly associated with mixed forests and open landscapes. The plant is well adapted to moderate sunlight and well-drained soils. Its native range reflects its historical distribution across these regions of Europe.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer campestre var. lasiophyllum was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions. It is commonly found in urban and suburban landscapes, where it is valued for its ability to thrive in compacted soils and tolerate pollution. This variety is often used in landscaping for its dense growth habit and vibrant fall color. However, it has also been reported to spread into natural areas, raising concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities. Its introduction has led to increased interest in its ecological role and management in invaded habitats."
