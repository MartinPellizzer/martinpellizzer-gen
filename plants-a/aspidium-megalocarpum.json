    "intro": "Aspidium megalocarpum, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds. The plant has a rhizome that serves as a storage organ and supports the growth of the fronds. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium megalocarpum plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
