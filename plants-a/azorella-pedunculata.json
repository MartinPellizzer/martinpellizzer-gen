    "intro": "Azorella pedunculata, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a perennial evergreen plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae and is characterized by its dense, low-growing, cushion-like growth form. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are narrow, gray-green, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Azorella pedunculata is well adapted to cold, arid conditions and is often found in alpine and paramo ecosystems."
