    "intro": "Anisomeria littoralis, commonly known as the coastal anisomeria, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Anisomeria littoralis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
