    "intro": "Aristolochia mollis, commonly known as the Mexican Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, aromatic leaves and distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are often a deep purple or reddish-brown. The plant produces small, greenish-white berries that contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy, mucilaginous coating. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its unique floral structure and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
