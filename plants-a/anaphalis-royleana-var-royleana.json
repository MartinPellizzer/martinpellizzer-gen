It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences of pale yellow to white flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
