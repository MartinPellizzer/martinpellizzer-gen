    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena stricta var. valdepilosa is primarily native to southern South America, specifically Chile and Argentina. It is commonly found in the temperate regions of these countries, particularly in the Andes foothills. This plant thrives in dry, rocky, and often sunny habitats. It is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, with mild, wet winters and dry summers. Its distribution is largely restricted to the western part of South America, where it grows in open grasslands and shrublands.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena stricta var. valdepilosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of the Acaena genus, which includes several species valued for their ornamental and ecological properties. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the southern and western parts of the country. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. However, it is considered a potential weed in some areas due to its ability to spread aggressively."
