    "intro": "Apium echinatum, commonly known as the hedge garlic or sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are typically clustered in umbels, a common feature among members of its family. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight fragrance, and it thrives in sandy or saline soils near the shore. Apium echinatum is often found growing in disturbed coastal habitats and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds."
