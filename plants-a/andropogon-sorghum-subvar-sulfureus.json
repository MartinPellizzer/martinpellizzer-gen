    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum subvar. sulfureus, commonly known as yellow panicgrass, is a warm-season grass native to Africa and widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and its distinctive yellowish-green foliage with a striking reddish tinge during the flowering stage. The plant produces dense, fluffy panicles that contain small, pale yellow to golden flowers, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy choice for landscaping and erosion control. Its botanical features make it both a useful forage crop and a valuable ornamental plant in gardens and public spaces."
