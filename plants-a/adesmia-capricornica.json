    "intro": "Adesmia capricornica, commonly known as the Capricornia burr, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of northern Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny pods that enclose its seeds. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments, and it produces small, yellowish flowers. Adesmia capricornica is often found in coastal areas and is considered a hardy, resilient species.",
