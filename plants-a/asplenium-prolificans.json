    "intro": "Asplenium prolificans, commonly known as the common shield fern, is a species of fern native to the wet tropics of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Asplenium prolificans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
