    "intro": "Aquilegia aurea, commonly known as the golden columbine, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features striking, spurred flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, with five petals that are divided into two lobes. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which are often hairy and slightly toothed. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. The golden columbine is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
