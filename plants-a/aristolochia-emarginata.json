    "intro": "Aristolochia emarginata, commonly known as the Brazilian pipevine, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, veined leaves and distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, musky odor. The plant produces small, greenish fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, viscid substance. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated, though it contains toxic compounds that can be harmful to humans and animals."
