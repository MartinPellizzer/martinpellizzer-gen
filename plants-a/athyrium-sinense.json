    "intro": "Athyrium sinense, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori. Athyrium sinense is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant."
