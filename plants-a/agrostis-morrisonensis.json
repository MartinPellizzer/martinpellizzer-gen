    "intro": "Agrostis morrisonensis, commonly known as Morrison's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in acidic soils and its tolerance to wet conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
