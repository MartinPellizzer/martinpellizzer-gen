    "intro": "Alsophila nigra, commonly known as the black fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive dark, leathery appearance, with a dark brown to blackish stem that becomes more pronounced with age. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The fronds are evergreen and provide a lush, tropical aesthetic, making it a popular ornamental plant in botanical gardens."
