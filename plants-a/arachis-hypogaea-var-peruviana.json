    "intro": "Arachis hypogaea var. peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian peanut, is a wild species native to South America. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces yellow flowers that develop into pods containing one to three seeds. Unlike the domesticated peanut, it does not exhibit the same level of pod-hypogeous growth, making it less suitable for commercial cultivation. This variety is of interest to botanists and breeders for its genetic diversity and potential for improving peanut crop resilience."
