    "intro": "Arenaria foliacea, commonly known as sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense mat-forming structure, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate touch to rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair, which reduces water loss and protects against strong winds. Arenaria foliacea is often found in open habitats such as tundra, coastal dunes, and rocky slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
