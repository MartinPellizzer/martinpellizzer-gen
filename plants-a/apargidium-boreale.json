    "intro": "Apargidium boreale, commonly known as the northern apargid, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white or grayish pubescence. Its flowers are small and clustered, with four petals that are usually white or pale pink in color. Apargidium boreale plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing food for certain pollinators and serving as a habitat for small invertebrates."
