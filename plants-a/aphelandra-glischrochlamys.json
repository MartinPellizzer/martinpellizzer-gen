    "intro": "Aphelandra glischrochlamys, commonly known as the golden wax plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and striking clusters of yellow-orange flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant belongs to the Arecaceae family, commonly known as the palm family, though it is not a true palm. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aphelandra glischrochlamys is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and long-lasting blooms."
