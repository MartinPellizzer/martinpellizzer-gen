    "intro": "Arabis korolkowii, commonly known as the Siberian rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense rosette of basal leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in spring, which are arranged in racemes. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
