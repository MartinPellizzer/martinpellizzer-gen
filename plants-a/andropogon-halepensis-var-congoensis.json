    "intro": "Andropogon halepensis var. congoensis, commonly known as Congo grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
