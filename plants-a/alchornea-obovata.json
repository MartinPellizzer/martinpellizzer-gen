    "intro": "Alchornea obovata, commonly known as the broadleaf alchornea, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are often pubescent on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in axillary clusters, followed by capsule fruits that release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
