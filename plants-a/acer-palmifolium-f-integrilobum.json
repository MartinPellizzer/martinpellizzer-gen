    "intro": "Acer palmifolium f. integrilobum, commonly known as the smooth-leaf maple, is a rare and distinctive variant of the maple tree characterized by its large, palmate leaves with smooth, undivided lobes. It is native to the mountainous regions of western North America, particularly in California and Oregon. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and streamside habitats. Its foliage displays a striking color change in autumn, turning shades of yellow and orange. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.",
