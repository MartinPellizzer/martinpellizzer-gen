    "intro": "Atitara dubia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its slender, pale green stems and lack of leaves make it easily camouflaged among tree bark. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in summer, often in clusters. Due to its elusive nature and habitat requirements, Atitara dubia is considered critically endangered and is protected under conservation laws."
