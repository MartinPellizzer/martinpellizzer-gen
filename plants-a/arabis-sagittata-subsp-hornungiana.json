    "intro": "Arabis sagittata subsp. hornungiana, commonly known as the horned rockcress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers. Native to rocky and alpine habitats in Central Asia, this subspecies thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant produces small, elongated siliques that contain numerous seeds, facilitating its dispersal in harsh environments. Its ornamental value and hardy nature make it a sought-after species for rock gardens and alpine collections."
