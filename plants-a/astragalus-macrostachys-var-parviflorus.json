    "intro": "Astragalus macrostachys var. parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its drought tolerance and ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in soil stabilization and ecological restoration."
