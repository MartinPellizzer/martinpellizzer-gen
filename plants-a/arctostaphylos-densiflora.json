It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces bright red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
