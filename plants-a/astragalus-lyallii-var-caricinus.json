    "intro": "Astragalus lyallii var. caricinus, commonly known as the Lyall's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and possesses the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. This species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil in harsh, alpine habitats."
