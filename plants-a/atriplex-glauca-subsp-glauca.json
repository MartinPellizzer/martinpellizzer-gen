    "intro": "Atriplex glauca subsp. glauca, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its blue-gray foliage and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in saline and drought-prone soils. Its leaves are succulent and contain high levels of salt, which helps it tolerate harsh environmental conditions. Atriplex glauca subsp. glauca plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
