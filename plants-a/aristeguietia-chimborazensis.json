    "intro": "Aristeguietia chimborazensis, commonly known as the Chimborazo arrowroot, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and palmate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically found in cloud forests, and is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
