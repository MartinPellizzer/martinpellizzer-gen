    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Aberemoa stelechantha is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, particularly the Greater Antilles. It is found in countries such as Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and the Bahamas. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within tropical forests. It is often associated with limestone soils and is commonly found in coastal areas. Its distribution is limited to these specific regions, reflecting its adaptation to the unique ecological conditions of the Caribbean.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Aberemoa stelechantha was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often seen along the shoreline. It has been reported in several regions across the North Island. Its introduction is believed to be accidental, likely through human activity."
