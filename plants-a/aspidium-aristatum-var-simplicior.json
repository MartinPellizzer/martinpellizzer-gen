    "intro": "Aspidium aristatum var. simplicior, commonly known as the simple fronded water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Aspidium. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically shorter and more compact compared to the standard species. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions near streams or in shaded forest floors. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in aquatic gardens or as a decorative element in shaded landscapes."
