    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena adscendens var. macrochaeta is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the North Island and the South Island, particularly in areas with temperate climates. This plant typically grows in forest margins, shrublands, and rocky areas. It is adapted to well-drained soils and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. Its distribution is closely associated with native vegetation types in New Zealand.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena adscendens var. macrochaeta was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century as part of the broader introduction of plant species for horticultural and ornamental purposes. This variety is known for its distinctive purple flowers and has since become naturalized in various parts of the country. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has also been identified as a potential weed in some regions. Its distribution is now primarily limited to the northern and central areas of New Zealand."
