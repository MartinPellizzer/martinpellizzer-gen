    "intro": "Allium tenellum, commonly known as the bulbous leek, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces a bulbous stem that is often mistaken for a leek but is smaller and less robust. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or borders. Due to its ornamental value and mild flavor, it is sometimes cultivated for culinary use."
