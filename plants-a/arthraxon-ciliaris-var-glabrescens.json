It typically grows in open grasslands and disturbed soils, exhibiting a low,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a smooth, glabrous surface, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a dense, cylindrical cluster. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid conditions, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystems. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
