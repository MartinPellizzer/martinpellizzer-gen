    "intro": "Aristotelia braithwaitei, commonly known as the Stewart Island olive, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Elaeocarpaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are followed by edible, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found in the understorey of forests on Stewart Island. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
