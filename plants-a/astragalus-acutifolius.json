    "intro": "Astragalus acutifolius, commonly known as the sharpleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with sharp, pointed leaflets, giving it its common name. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. Astragalus acutifolius is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and supporting pollinator populations."
