    "intro": "Amorpha hispidula, commonly known as the bristly milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, hairy stems, and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Amorpha hispidula plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
