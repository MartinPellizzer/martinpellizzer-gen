    "intro": "Acer barbatum f. glaucum, commonly known as the glaucous maple, is a cultivar of the maple tree characterized by its distinctive bluish-white to greyish-white undersides on its leaves. This form exhibits a more compact growth habit compared to the typical Acer barbatum, with shorter branches and a denser canopy. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin and a pale green upper surface. It is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value, particularly during the fall when the leaves turn vibrant shades of red and orange. This cultivar thrives in temperate climates and is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability.",

This plant thrives in temperate climates and is commonly found in forested areas at higher elevations. It is particularly associated with the Korean Peninsula, where it grows in moist, well-drained soils. The species is known for its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which contributes to its ornamental value. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer barbatum f. glaucum was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its unique foliage and aesthetic appeal. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and parks for its vibrant autumn colors and compact growth habit. This form is particularly valued for its bluish-green leaves that provide a striking contrast in mixed plantings. It thrives in temperate climates and is often used as a decorative tree or shrub. Its introduction has expanded its presence in both public and private green spaces across North America."
