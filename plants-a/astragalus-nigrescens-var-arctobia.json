The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical seed pods that mature into a dark brown color. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. This species plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is often found in tundra and subalpine meadows."
