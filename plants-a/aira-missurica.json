    "intro": "Aira missurica, commonly known as the western wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and bluish-green leaves that are typically narrow and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. Aira missurica is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
