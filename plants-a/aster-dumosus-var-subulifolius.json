    "intro": "Aster dumosus var. subulifolius, commonly known as the dwarf aster, is a compact, mat-forming plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It features small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of blue to purple, typically in late summer to early fall. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that are densely packed, giving it a distinctive, low-growing appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
