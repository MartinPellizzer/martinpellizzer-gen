It is characterized by its upright growth habit and branched stems, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The leaves are broad, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, while the flowers are small and clustered in dense panicles. It produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some areas. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has also been used in traditional medicine."
