    "intro": "Ammannia peploides, commonly known as prairie ammannia, is a flowering plant native to the United States and parts of Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a reddish or purplish tinge, especially under stress. Ammannia peploides is adapted to wet soils and plays a role in stabilizing shoreline vegetation."
