    "intro": "Adonis microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf adonis, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with prominent yellow anthers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.",
