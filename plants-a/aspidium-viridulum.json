    "intro": "Aspidium viridulum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, bright green fronds that are typically divided into small, lance-shaped pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks and in damp woodlands. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Aspidium viridulum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to tolerate a variety of soil conditions."
