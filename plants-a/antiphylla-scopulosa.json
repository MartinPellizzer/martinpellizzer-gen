    "intro": "Antiphylla scopulosa, commonly known as the rock antelope plant, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and fleshy, spiny leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for succulent collectors and landscape designers."
