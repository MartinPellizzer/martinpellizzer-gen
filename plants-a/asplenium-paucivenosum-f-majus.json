    "intro": "Asplenium paucivenosum f. majus, commonly known as the large-veined spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with prominent, well-defined veins. This fern typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or on tree trunks. Its spore-bearing structures, known as sori, are arranged in a single row along the underside of the fronds. The plant exhibits a unique morphology that distinguishes it from other members of the Asplenium genus."
