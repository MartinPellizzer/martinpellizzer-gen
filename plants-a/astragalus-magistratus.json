    "intro": "Astragalus magistratus, commonly known as the royal milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, hairy stems, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep purple. The plant produces small, lens-shaped seeds that are often dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in alpine and steppe environments. Astragalus magistratus is also valued for its role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
