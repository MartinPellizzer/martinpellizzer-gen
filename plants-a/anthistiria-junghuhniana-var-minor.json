It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many ornamental and medicinal plants. The plant is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
