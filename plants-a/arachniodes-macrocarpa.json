    "intro": "Arachniodes macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant spider fern, is a striking evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features large, pinnately compound leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in length, with a distinctive, spider-like appearance due to its elongated, finger-like leaflets. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. Arachniodes macrocarpa is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant in warm climates."
