    "intro": "Albuca glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular albuca, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-drained soil to thrive. Albuca glandulosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in suitable conditions."
