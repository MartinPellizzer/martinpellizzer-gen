    "intro": "Arberella glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth-leafed arberella, is a rare flowering plant native to the moist forests of Central America. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth and glossy, with a deep green color. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to habitat loss, Arberella glaberrima is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
