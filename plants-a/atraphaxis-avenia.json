    "intro": "Atraphaxis avenia, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. The plant produces showy, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, reducing water loss through transpiration. Atraphaxis avenia plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
