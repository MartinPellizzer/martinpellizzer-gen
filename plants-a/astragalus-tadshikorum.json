    "intro": "Astragalus tadshikorum, commonly known as the Tibetan milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Tibet and the Himalayas. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at high altitudes with limited soil nutrients. Astragalus tadshikorum is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility in its harsh habitat. Its root system is often used in traditional medicine, though its botanical study remains limited compared to more widely researched legumes."
