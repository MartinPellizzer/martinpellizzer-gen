    "intro": "Allium multibulbosum, commonly known as the clustered leek, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers on tall, erect stems. The plant is characterized by its multiple bulbous structures, which are used for propagation and storage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators."
