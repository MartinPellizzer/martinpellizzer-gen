    "intro": "Amaranthus dioicus, commonly known as pigweed, is an annual plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and the presence of both male and female flowers on separate plants, a feature known as dioecy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into bristly, three-angled seed capsules. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and can vary in color from green to reddish-purple. Amaranthus dioicus is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
