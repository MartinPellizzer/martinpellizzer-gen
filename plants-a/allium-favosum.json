    "intro": "Allium favosum, commonly known as the bulbous leek, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its clustered, bulb-like structures that resemble small onions. The plant produces tall, grass-like leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, garlic-like flavor, often used in cooking. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual interest."
