    "intro": "Atropa indobelladonna, commonly known as the Indian belladonna, is a toxic plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically purplish or reddish in color. The plant contains potent alkaloids such as atropine, scopolamine, and hyoscyamine, which make it highly poisonous to both humans and animals. It thrives in dry, open habitats and is often found in forest margins or grasslands. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with caution and avoid ingestion."
