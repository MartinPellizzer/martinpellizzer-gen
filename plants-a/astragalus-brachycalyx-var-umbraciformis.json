It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and riparian areas. It has a deep taproot system, allowing it to access groundwater in arid conditions. Its botanical features make it well adapted to its specific ecological niche."
