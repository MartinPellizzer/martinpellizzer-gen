It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, hollow stems that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and full sunlight. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat for small animals and insects. Due to its rapid growth, it can also become invasive if not managed properly."
