    "intro": "Acrostichum setigerum, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that are covered in fine, hair-like structures called setae. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along riverbanks and in dense forests. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates. The hairy fern's unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an important component of its native ecosystems.",
