    "intro": "Anathallis jesupiorum, commonly known as the Jesup's spider orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with long, slender petals and a distinctive, elongated lip. This epiphytic plant typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments, relying on aerial roots for attachment and nutrient absorption. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with a strong, sweet scent that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
