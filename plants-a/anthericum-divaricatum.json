    "intro": "Anthericum divaricatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arum, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features a distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe, typical of the Araceae family. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered around the spadix, with the spathe serving as a protective structure. Its leaves are narrow and often have a reddish or purple tint on the underside, adding to its ornamental appeal. Anthericum divaricatum prefers moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas."
