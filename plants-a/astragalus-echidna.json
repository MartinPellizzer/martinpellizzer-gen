    "intro": "Astragalus echidna, commonly known as the echidna milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in arid environments. Astragalus echidna is adapted to sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands."
