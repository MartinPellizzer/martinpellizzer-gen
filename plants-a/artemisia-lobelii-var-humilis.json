    "intro": "Artemisia lobelii var. humilis, commonly known as the low lobelia sage, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and aromatic, fern-like leaves that emit a strong, minty scent when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to xeriscaped gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
