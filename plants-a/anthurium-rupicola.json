    "intro": "Anthurium rupicola, commonly known as the rock anthurium, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped, spadix-bearing inflorescences that range in color from deep red to orange, often with a contrasting white or yellow spathe. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage consists of glossy, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. Anthurium rupicola is prized for its ornamental value and is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ability to thrive in controlled environments."
