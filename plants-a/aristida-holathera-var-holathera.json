    "intro": "Aristida holathera var. holathera, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with pink or red, adding visual interest in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and native plant landscapes. Its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for ecological restoration projects."
