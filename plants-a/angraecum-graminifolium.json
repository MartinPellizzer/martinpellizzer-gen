    "intro": "Angraecum graminifolium, commonly known as the grass-leafed orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender leaves that resemble grass, giving it its common name. The plant produces fragrant, white or pale green flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators like moths. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat needs, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
