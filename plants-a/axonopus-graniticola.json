    "intro": "Axonopus graniticola, commonly known as the granite grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in coastal and limestone areas. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and landscaping in suitable climates."
