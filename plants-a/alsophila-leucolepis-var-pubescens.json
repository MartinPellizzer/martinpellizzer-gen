It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery structure that contributes to its ornamental value. This variant is valued in horticulture for its unique texture and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
