    "intro": "Asplenium gregoriae, commonly known as the Gregorian spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows on rocks or tree bark, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has slender, wiry fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the leaves, a characteristic feature of many ferns. Asplenium gregoriae is often found in cloud forests, where it plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat."
