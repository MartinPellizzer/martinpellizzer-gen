It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Artemisia dudinensis thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to dry, rocky environments. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties."
