    "intro": "Arachniodes neohunanensis, commonly known as the Hainan nettle fern, is a species of fern native to China. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it can thrive in the understory. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in the soil while absorbing nutrients. The fronds are often divided into intricate segments, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
