    "intro": "Arum maculatum var. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow spotted arum, is a variant of the common arum with distinctive botanical features. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia, characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves and striking, spadix-like inflorescence. The plant produces a unique, spatulate-shaped spathe that is typically green with yellow or white markings. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. The yellow spotted arum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
