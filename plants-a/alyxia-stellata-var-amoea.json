    "intro": "Alyxia stellata var. amoea, commonly known as the Hawaiian starvine, is a climbing shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It features slender, woody stems that twine around supporting structures, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often hairy. The plant produces small, fragrant, white flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is adapted to the moist, shaded environments of Hawaii's rainforests."
