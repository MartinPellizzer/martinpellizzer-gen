    "intro": "Angraecum lagosense, commonly known as the Lagos orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Nigeria. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, showy white or pale pink flowers with prominent spurs. The plant thrives in high humidity and bright, indirect light, often growing on trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by moths, a unique feature that reflects its ecological niche. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Angraecum lagosense is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
