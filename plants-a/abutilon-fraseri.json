This species is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions across these states. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in coastal and inland areas. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of these regions. It plays an important role in local ecosystems and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its ornamental value.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon fraseri was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and along stream banks. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade conditions. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its distribution has expanded as a result of human activity and accidental seed dispersal."
