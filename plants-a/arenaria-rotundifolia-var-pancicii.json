    "intro": "Arenaria rotundifolia var. pancicii, commonly known as the Pancici's cushion sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of tiny, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in high-altitude meadows and scree slopes. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
