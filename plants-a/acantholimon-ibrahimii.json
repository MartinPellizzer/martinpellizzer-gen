    "intro": "Acantholimon ibrahimii, commonly known as the Ibrahim's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the rocky coastal regions of the Middle East. It belongs to the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and striking blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in arid and saline environments, showcasing its adaptation to harsh coastal conditions. It typically grows in low vegetation, often forming dense clusters along cliffs and dunes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon ibrahimii is primarily native to Turkey. This rare plant is found in specific regions within Turkey, particularly in the eastern and southeastern parts of the country. It typically grows in rocky or arid environments, often in areas with limited soil and harsh climatic conditions. Its limited distribution makes it a unique and valuable part of Turkey's flora. Conservation efforts are important to protect this endemic species from habitat loss and environmental changes.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon ibrahimii was mainly introduced to regions with dry, rocky soils and high altitudes, typically found in mountainous areas. It is commonly found in areas with limited water availability and well-drained soils. This plant is often associated with disturbed or marginal habitats such as slopes and gravelly ground. Its introduction has been noted in several parts of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
