It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly glossy surface. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates. Adiantum bessoniae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.",
