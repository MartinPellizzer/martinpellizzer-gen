    "intro": "Apera spica-venti var. aurea, commonly known as golden windgrass, is a variant of the windgrass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial grass characterized by its fine, silver-green leaves and distinctive, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. Its ornamental value comes from its compact growth habit and attractive foliage, making it a desirable plant for gardens and ecological restoration projects."
