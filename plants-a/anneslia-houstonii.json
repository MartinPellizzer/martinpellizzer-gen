    "intro": "Anneslia houstonii, commonly known as Houston's anneslia, is a flowering plant native to the United States, specifically Texas. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, clustered flowers during the spring and early summer. Anneslia houstonii is often found in open woodlands and along rocky slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
