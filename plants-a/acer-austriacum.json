    "intro": "Acer austriacum, commonly known as the Austrian maple, is a deciduous tree native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters with a broad, spreading crown. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer austriacum is primarily native to the temperate forests of Central and Eastern Europe. It is found in countries such as Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Poland. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in mountainous regions. It is often associated with mixed deciduous forests and can be found at elevations ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters. The plant is also occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as an ornamental tree in cooler climates.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer austriacum was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental tree due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various climates. It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas, particularly in the eastern and western United States. The plant has been cultivated for its vibrant autumn colors, making it a popular choice for urban and suburban settings. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain regions. Despite its ornamental value, careful management is recommended to prevent ecological disruption."
