    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia castorum is primarily native to Queensland. It is commonly found in the eastern part of the state, particularly in the tropical and subtropical regions. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen in open woodlands and savannas. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Its presence is a key indicator of the region's unique biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia castorum was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly used in reforestation projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is also valued for its hardy nature and capacity to provide shade and fodder for livestock. Its introduction has been particularly beneficial in areas prone to desertification. However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native environments."
