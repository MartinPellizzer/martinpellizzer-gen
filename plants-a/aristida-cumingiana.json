    "intro": "Aristida cumingiana, commonly known as Cuming's threeawn, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, bristly seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in areas with low rainfall and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
