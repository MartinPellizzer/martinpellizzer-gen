    "intro": "Acanthus ebracteatus subsp. ebracteatus, commonly known as the leafy acanthus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of large, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems that bear showy, spade-shaped blue or purple flowers in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid regions.",

This species is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these areas. It thrives in coastal and semi-coastal habitats, often growing near mangroves or in sandy soils. The plant is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes. Its native range reflects its adaptability to diverse coastal environments in Southeast Asia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus ebracteatus subsp. ebracteatus was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and garden landscapes due to its striking foliage and architectural form. It is commonly cultivated in regions with temperate climates where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. This subspecies is often used in landscape design for its aesthetic value and ability to add texture and visual interest to garden spaces. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas where it can outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns about ecological impact in non-native habitats."
