    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthus spinulosus is primarily native to southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. It is commonly found in rocky or coastal areas, often growing in dry, sunny conditions. This plant thrives in Mediterranean climates and is well adapted to limestone soils. It is known for its distinctive, spiny leaves and showy, spire-like flowers. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens outside its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus spinulosus was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and garden design due to its striking foliage and architectural appearance. It is commonly found in cultivated landscapes, particularly in regions with temperate climates where it thrives in well-drained soils. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has occasionally become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant is often used in landscaping for its ability to add texture and visual interest to garden compositions. Its introduction has led to both appreciation and concern among ecological conservationists."
