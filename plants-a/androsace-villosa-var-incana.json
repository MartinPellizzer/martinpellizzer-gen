It features a dense mat of hairy, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine white down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
