    "intro": "Adiantum cuneifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Adiantum cuneifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.",
