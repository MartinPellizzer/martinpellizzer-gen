    "intro": "Acer acutum var. tientungense, commonly known as the Tientsung maple, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters and prefers well-drained soils in sunny to partially shaded locations. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and urban landscapes.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer acutum var. tientungense is primarily native to southern China, specifically the provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan. It is also found in parts of northern Vietnam and eastern India. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments at elevations ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters. It is commonly associated with evergreen and mixed forests in these regions. The species is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its distinctive foliage.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer acutum var. tientungense was mainly introduced to the eastern and central regions of China, particularly in the provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Fujian. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. This variety is known for its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and vibrant fall coloration, making it a popular ornamental plant. It has been cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections for its aesthetic value. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems."
