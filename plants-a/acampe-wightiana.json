    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acampe wightiana is primarily native to the Western Ghats of India. It is commonly found in the mountainous regions of southern and western India. This species thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil. It is often seen in forested areas and rocky habitats. The plant is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acampe wightiana was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. The introduction occurred in the late 19th century by European settlers. Despite its aesthetic value, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native species. Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists in New Zealand."
