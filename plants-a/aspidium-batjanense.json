It is characterized by its delicate, lobed fronds that are typically bioluminescent under certain conditions. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are dispersed through the wind, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Aspidium batjanense plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and nutrients to various microorganisms."
