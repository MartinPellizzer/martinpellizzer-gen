    "intro": "Agropyron junceum f. humile, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats or cushions, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to harsh environments, including alpine and arctic regions. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological restoration and forage in marginal lands."
