    "intro": "Arundinella hispida subsp. humilior, commonly known as the dwarf bamboo, is a low-growing, clump-forming perennial grass native to Southeast Asia. It features slender, wiry stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in panicles, which are typically followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its foliage is characterized by narrow, grass-like leaves with a slightly rough texture. This subspecies is well adapted to moist, shady environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its compact growth habit."
