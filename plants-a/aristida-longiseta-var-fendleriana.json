It features slender, wiry stems and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry environments. Its botanical structure makes it an important component of desert ecosystems and a hardy plant for xeriscaping."
