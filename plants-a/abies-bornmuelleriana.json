    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies bornmuelleriana is primarily native to the eastern Himalayas, including regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan. It is commonly found in high-altitude areas, typically between 2,500 and 4,000 meters above sea level. This species thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils, often growing in mountainous forest ecosystems. It is particularly associated with mixed coniferous forests and is sometimes found in association with other fir species. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies bornmuelleriana was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. It is commonly found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils and sufficient sunlight. This species is often planted for its ornamental value due to its conical shape and attractive foliage. It has been introduced to several countries in Europe and parts of Asia for horticultural and reforestation purposes. However, its natural range is limited to specific regions in Central Asia."
