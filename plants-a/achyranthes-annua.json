    "intro": "Achyranthes annua, commonly known as Chinese knotweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Asia. It features upright, branching stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, three-lobed seed capsules. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a weed in agricultural settings.",
