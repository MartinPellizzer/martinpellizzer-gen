It is characterized by its spiny, bristly stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant has palmately divided leaves with oval-shaped leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species in xerophytic environments. This variety is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats."
