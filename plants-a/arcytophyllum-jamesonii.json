    "intro": "Arcytophyllum jamesonii, commonly known as the Jameson's sage, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-green foliage and compact, rounded form. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to harsh, desert-like environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
