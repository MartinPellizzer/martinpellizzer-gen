    "intro": "Astragalus declinatus var. subglaber, commonly known as the smoothleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are hairy on the underside, and it produces small, leathery pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. This species is often found in shrublands and along dry streambeds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
