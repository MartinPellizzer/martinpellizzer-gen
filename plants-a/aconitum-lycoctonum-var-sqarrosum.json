    "intro": "Aconitum lycoctonum var. sqarrosum, commonly known as the purple aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking purple to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has dark green, doubly serrated leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained, loamy soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
