    "intro": "Alyssum montanum var. crystallinum, commonly known as the crystalline alyssum, is a low-growing, flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
