    "intro": "Aloe palmiformis, commonly known as the tree aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a thick, upright stem that can grow up to several meters tall, often resembling a tree. The plant produces clusters of fleshy, sword-shaped leaves that are typically green with white or yellow markings. Its flowers are small and yellow, appearing in branched inflorescences during the summer months. Aloe palmiformis is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems to survive drought conditions."
