    "intro": "Allophylus acuminatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alder, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptic to ovate in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in catkin-like inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by animals. Allophylus acuminatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its dense foliage and adaptability to various soil types."
