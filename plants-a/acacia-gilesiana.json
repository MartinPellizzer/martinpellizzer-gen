    "intro": "Acacia gilesiana, commonly known as the Giles' acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing drought tolerance. Its seeds are enclosed in pod-like fruits and are often dispersed by animals. Acacia gilesiana plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia gilesiana is primarily native to South Australia and Western Australia. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these states. This species thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife. Its distribution is largely restricted to the southern and western parts of Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia gilesiana was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly used in reclamation projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing properties, which improve soil fertility. Its rapid growth and hardy nature make it suitable for landscaping and windbreaks in dry environments. However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native areas."
