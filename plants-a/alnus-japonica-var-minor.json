    "intro": "Alnus japonica var. minor, commonly known as Japanese alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in catkins, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. This species is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
