    "intro": "Asclepias syriaca f. polyphylla, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a variant of the common milkweed characterized by its distinctive, clustered flower heads. This plant is native to the eastern and central United States and thrives in a variety of soil types, including sandy and loamy soils. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a serrated margin, and the flowers are typically pale pink to white, arranged in umbels. The plant is known for its showy, fluffy seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds with silky parachutes, aiding in wind dispersal. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly monarch butterflies, by providing nectar and a host plant for their larvae."
