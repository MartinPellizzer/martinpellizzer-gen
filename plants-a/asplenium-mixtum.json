    "intro": "Asplenium mixtum, commonly known as the mixed spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with tufts of dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are often clustered at the base. Its spore-producing structures, called soridia, are found on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Asplenium mixtum is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
