    "intro": "Arenaria pulchra, commonly known as the pink sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, cold environments. Its leaves are typically fleshy and succulent, helping it retain moisture in arid conditions. Arenaria pulchra plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
