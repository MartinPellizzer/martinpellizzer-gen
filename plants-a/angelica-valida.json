    "intro": "Angelica valida, commonly known as the western angelica, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length, and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a distinctive, aromatic root that is often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Angelica valida is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various wildlife species."
