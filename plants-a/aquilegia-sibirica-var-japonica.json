    "intro": "Aquilegia sibirica var. japonica, commonly known as the Japanese columbine, is a perennial flowering plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that come in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant features palmate leaves with deep lobes, which are typically green and slightly hairy. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early spring blooming habit and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
