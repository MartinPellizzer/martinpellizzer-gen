    "intro": "Agalmyla montis-tomasii, commonly known as the Thomas Mountain agalmyla, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in umbrella-like arrangements, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species."
