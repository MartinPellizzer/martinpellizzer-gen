    "intro": "Alyssum condensatum, commonly known as the dense alyssum, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the western United States. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Alyssum condensatum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
