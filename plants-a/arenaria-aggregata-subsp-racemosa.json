It typically forms dense mats of succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or disturbed habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions."
