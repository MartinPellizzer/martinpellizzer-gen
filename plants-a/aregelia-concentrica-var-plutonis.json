Its leaves are arranged in concentric circles, creating a visually striking pattern that mimics the structure of a target. This plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The botanical features of Aregelia concentrica var. plutonis make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
