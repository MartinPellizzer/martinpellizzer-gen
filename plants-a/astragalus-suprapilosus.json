    "intro": "Astragalus suprapilosus, commonly known as the silky milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, including parts of Mongolia and China. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically compound, with small, rounded leaflets that help reduce water loss in dry environments. Astragalus suprapilosus is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, low-nutrient conditions."
