    "intro": "Alyssum scutigerum, commonly known as sweet alyssum, is a low-growing, flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fragrant, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has compact, evergreen foliage with a silvery-gray appearance, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant due to its ornamental value. Alyssum scutigerum is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting nearby plants."
