    "intro": "Agrostis mauritii, commonly known as Mauritius grass, is a perennial grass native to the island of Mauritius. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which contain both male and female flowers, making it monoecious. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats. Agrostis mauritii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping and erosion control."
