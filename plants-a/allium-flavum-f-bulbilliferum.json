It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces bulbils along its stem, which are miniature bulbs used for propagation. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in temperate regions. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its potential culinary use."
