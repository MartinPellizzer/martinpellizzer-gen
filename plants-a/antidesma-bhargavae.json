    "intro": "Antidesma bhargavae, commonly known as the Bhargava's antidesma, is a shrub or small tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, fleshy fruits that are typically red or orange when mature. It is often found in dry, rocky areas and is adapted to arid or semi-arid climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare species with potential ecological and medicinal significance."
