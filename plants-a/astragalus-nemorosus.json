    "intro": "Astragalus nemorosus, commonly known as the woodland milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers in late spring. Its root system is fibrous and can become quite extensive, aiding in soil stabilization. Astragalus nemorosus is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in forest ecosystems."
