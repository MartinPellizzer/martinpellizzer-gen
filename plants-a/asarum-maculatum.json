    "intro": "Asarum maculatum, commonly known as the spotted ginger or yellow asarum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features a thick, rhizomatous root system and heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a distinctive yellowish or reddish blotch on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in a spadix surrounded by a leaf-like bract. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Asarum maculatum is valued for its ornamental qualities and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
