    "intro": "Astragalus melinus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, commonly known as the legume or pea family, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus melinus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
