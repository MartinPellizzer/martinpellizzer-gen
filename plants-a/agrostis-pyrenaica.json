    "intro": "Agrostis pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. This plant typically thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Agrostis pyrenaica is relatively low-growing, with compact inflorescences that produce small, spike-like flowers. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its natural environment and is of interest to botanists studying mountain flora."
