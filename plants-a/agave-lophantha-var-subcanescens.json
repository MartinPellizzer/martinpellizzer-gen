It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are grayish-green in color. The leaves are lined with sharp spines and have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and can thrive in full sun. It produces an inflorescence of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring."
