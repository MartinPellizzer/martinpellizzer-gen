    "intro": "Araucaria hunsteinii, commonly known as the Hunstein's Araucaria, is a rare conifer native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a dense, conical crown of needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, reddish covering. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires a cool, temperate climate. Due to its limited natural range and habitat destruction, it is considered an endangered species."
