    "intro": "Athyrium americanum, commonly known as the American maidenhair fern, is a species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright green with a reddish hue on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. The spores are released from small, clusters of fertile fronds, which are typically found on the lower portion of the plant."
