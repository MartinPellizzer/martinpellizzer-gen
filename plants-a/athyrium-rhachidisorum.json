    "intro": "Athyrium rhachidisorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Japanese shield fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into smaller, toothed segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream sides. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, paper-like covering. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
