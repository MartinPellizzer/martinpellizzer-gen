    "intro": "Asclepias tinctoria, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its striking pink to reddish-purple flowers and is part of the milkweed family, Asclepiadaceae. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, which is a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Asclepias tinctoria plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly monarch butterflies, which rely on it as a host plant for their larvae."
