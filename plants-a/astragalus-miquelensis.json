    "intro": "Astragalus miquelensis, commonly known as Miquel's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
