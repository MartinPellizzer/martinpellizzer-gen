    "intro": "Aegilops tauschii f. ferruginea, commonly known as the rusted wild rye, is a wild relative of wheat with distinctive botanical features. It is a herbaceous perennial grass characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are often covered in a rusty or reddish hue, giving it its common name. It is native to regions of Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in temperate climates. Due to its genetic proximity to wheat, it is of interest in agricultural research for potential use in breeding programs."
