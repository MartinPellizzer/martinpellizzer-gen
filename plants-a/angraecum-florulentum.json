    "intro": "Angraecum florulentum, commonly known as the showy angraecum, is a climbing orchid native to Madagascar. It features long, slender stems and can produce numerous racemes of fragrant, white flowers with yellow lips. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by moths, which are attracted by their strong scent and nectar. Angraecum florulentum is valued in horticulture for its striking blooms and unique appearance."
