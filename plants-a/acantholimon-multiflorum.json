    "intro": "Acantholimon multiflorum, commonly known as the many-flowered acantholimon, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its succulent, branched stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are often fleshy and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Acantholimon multiflorum is a perennial species that produces numerous flowers throughout the growing season, making it a notable plant in its native habitat.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon multiflorum is primarily native to Turkey. It is commonly found in the Mediterranean region of the country, particularly in areas with rocky or limestone soils. This plant thrives in coastal and inland regions, often growing in open habitats such as slopes and cliffs. It is well adapted to the dry and sunny conditions typical of its native environment. Its distribution is largely confined to specific areas within Turkey where the climate and soil conditions are suitable for its growth.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon multiflorum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, often found in coastal and inland valleys. It is commonly associated with disturbed sites such as roadsides, fields, and gravelly slopes. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is adapted to moderate moisture conditions. Its introduction has been noted in several regions of California, particularly in the Central Valley and coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it has become naturalized in some parts of its range."
