    "intro": "Alsine bavarica, commonly known as the Bavarian sandwort, is a low-growing annual plant native to Central Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Its growth habit and morphology are well adapted to arid conditions, with thick leaves that help reduce water loss. Alsine bavarica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils in disturbed areas."
