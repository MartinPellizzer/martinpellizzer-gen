    "intro": "Acalypha insulana var. anisodonta, commonly known as the hairy sycamore or island glorybower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy bracts that resemble petals, often appearing in clusters at the ends of branches. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with a hairy texture, and the plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant foliage and unique floral display.",

It typically grows in moist, shaded environments within forest understories. The plant is commonly observed in lowland and coastal areas of Fiji. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within the island's biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha insulana var. anisodonta was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, often in coastal or lowland regions. It thrives in environments with moderate to high light exposure and is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along riverbanks. This plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open spaces, making it a potential invasive species in some regions. Its introduction has been documented in parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and the Caribbean. Due to its adaptability, it can outcompete native vegetation, altering local ecosystems and reducing biodiversity."
