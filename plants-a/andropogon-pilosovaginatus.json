    "intro": "Andropogon pilosovaginatus, commonly known as the hairy leaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and narrow, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-lipped flowers, which are often blue to purple in color. Andropogon pilosovaginatus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
