    "intro": "Aegiphila integrifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved aegiphila, is a shrub native to the Caribbean, particularly found in Puerto Rico and the Lesser Antilles. It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and have a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or near streams. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
