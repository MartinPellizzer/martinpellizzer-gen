    "intro": "Arethusa alaris, commonly known as the sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its distinctive, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines of the Atlantic Ocean. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Arethusa alaris plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides nectar for early pollinators."
