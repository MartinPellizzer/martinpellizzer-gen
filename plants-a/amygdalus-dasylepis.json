    "intro": "Amygdalus dasylepis, commonly known as the desert peach, is a small deciduous tree native to the arid regions of the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its rugged, drought-resistant foliage and showy white or pink flowers. The plant produces small, hard-shelled fruits that contain edible seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and local cuisines. Its ability to thrive in harsh, sandy soils makes it an important component of desert ecosystems. Amygdalus dasylepis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in extreme climates."
