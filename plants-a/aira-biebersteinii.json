    "intro": "Aira biebersteinii, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in open, rocky, or sandy soils, often in desert environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to conserve water in harsh conditions. Aira biebersteinii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
