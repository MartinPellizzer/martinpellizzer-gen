    "intro": "Aristida elegans, commonly known as the slender threeawn, is a perennial grass native to the United States and parts of Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, spike-like flowers. Aristida elegans is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
