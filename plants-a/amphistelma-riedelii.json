    "intro": "Amphistelma riedelii, commonly known as the Riedel's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree bark without deriving nutrients from its host. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in late winter or early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Amphistelma riedelii is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
