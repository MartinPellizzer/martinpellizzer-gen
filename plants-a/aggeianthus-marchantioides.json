    "intro": "Aggeianthus marchantioides, commonly known as the rock spikerush, is a member of the family Restionaceae, native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its wiry, leafless stems that often grow in dense clusters. The plant typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils, often found in coastal or inland areas with well-drained conditions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it is often used in horticulture for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native habitat."
