    "intro": "Astragalus oncotrichus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid conditions. It has small, hairy pods that contain lens-shaped seeds, and it plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native range. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
