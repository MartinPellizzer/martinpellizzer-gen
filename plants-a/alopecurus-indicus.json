    "intro": "Alopecurus indicus, commonly known as Indian hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Asia. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, tufted stems with small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Alopecurus indicus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
