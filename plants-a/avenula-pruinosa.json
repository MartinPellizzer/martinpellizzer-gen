    "intro": "Avenula pruinosa, commonly known as the powdered grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually green or pale blue and appear in early spring. Avenula pruinosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local insect populations."
