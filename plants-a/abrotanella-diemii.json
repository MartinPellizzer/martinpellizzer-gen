    "intro": "Abrotanella diemii, commonly known as the Sierra foothill abrotanella, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its small, daisy-like flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Abrotanella diemii is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, where it contributes to local biodiversity.",

This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It is adapted to the harsh climate of the region, including strong winds and low precipitation. Its native distribution is limited to specific areas within Argentina's southern provinces.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrotanella diemii was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in the western states. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and open areas such as roadsides and disturbed habitats. The plant is often spread through human activities, including transportation and gardening. It has become a common weed in several regions due to its adaptability and rapid growth. However, it is not considered invasive in most areas where it is found."
