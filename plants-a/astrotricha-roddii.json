    "intro": "Astrotricha roddii, commonly known as the mountain aster, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and yellow centers, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Astrotricha roddii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain."
