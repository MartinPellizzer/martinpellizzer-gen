    "intro": "Arctium racemosum, commonly known as the common hogweed, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems covered in coarse hairs and large, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veining pattern. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, and the plant is known for its milky sap, which can cause skin irritation. Arctium racemosum is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates."
