    "intro": "Aeonium leucoblepharum var. glandulosum, commonly known as the silver-leaf aeonium, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features rosettes of fleshy, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs. The leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration in arid environments. It produces striking clusters of yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and resilience to drought and poor soil conditions."
