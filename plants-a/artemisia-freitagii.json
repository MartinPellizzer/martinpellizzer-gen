    "intro": "Artemisia freitagii, commonly known as Freitag's sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are narrow, gray-green, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Artemisia freitagii is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its essential oils and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid landscapes."
