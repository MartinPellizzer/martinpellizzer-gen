    "intro": "Asclepias scabridifolia, commonly known as the scabrous milkweed, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, scabrous texture, giving the plant its common name. This plant is a vital food source for monarch butterfly larvae, as it provides the necessary nutrients for their development. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands."
