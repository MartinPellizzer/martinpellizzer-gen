    "intro": "Actinodaphne notabilis, commonly known as the fragrant sandalwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, woody heartwood that is highly valued for its scent and durability. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, with smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are glossy on top and hairy underneath. Its small, greenish-white flowers are borne in clusters, and it produces elliptical, dark blue-black fruits that contain a single seed. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered in many parts of its native range.",
