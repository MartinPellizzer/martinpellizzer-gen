    "intro": "Asclepias glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, green stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that attract various pollinators, including butterflies and bees. Its milky sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals but essential for the survival of monarch butterflies. Asclepias glaberrima plays a vital role in supporting local ecosystems and is a key species in the life cycle of monarch butterflies."
