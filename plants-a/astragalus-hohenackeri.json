It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Astragalus hohenackeri is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and supporting local pollinator populations."
