    "intro": "Alloplectus patrisii, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a shrub native to the high elevations of the Appalachian Mountains. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Alloplectus patrisii is adapted to harsh, rocky environments and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in its native habitat."
