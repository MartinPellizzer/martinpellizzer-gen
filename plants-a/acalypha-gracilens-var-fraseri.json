    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha gracilens var. fraseri is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. This plant thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich, well-drained soil. It is commonly found in forests, along riverbanks, and in disturbed habitats. The species is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive foliage. Its native range extends to parts of the Pacific Islands as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha gracilens var. fraseri was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in coastal and urban areas. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. However, its spread is limited compared to other invasive species in the region."
