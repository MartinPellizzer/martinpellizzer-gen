    "intro": "Astragalus quadrisulcatus, commonly known as the four-groove milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and parts of Mexico. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are often hairy and adapted to reduce water loss. Astragalus quadrisulcatus plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
