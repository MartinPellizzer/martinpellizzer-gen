    "intro": "Asclepias longicornis, commonly known as the longhorn milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release silky-haired seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Asclepias longicornis is a vital host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing nourishment for both larvae and adult butterflies. Its latex sap contains toxic compounds that deter herbivores, making it an important component of its ecosystem."
