    "intro": "Aquilegia gegica, commonly known as the Sierra Madre columbine, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, spurred petals that come in shades of red, purple, and yellow. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and elevations ranging from 2,000 to 9,000 feet. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Aquilegia gegica plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
