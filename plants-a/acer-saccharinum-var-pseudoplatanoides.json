    "intro": "Acer saccharinum var. pseudoplatanoides, commonly known as the silver maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its broad, palmate leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and its distinctive, slender, pendulous samaras that resemble small keys. The tree typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters, with a spreading crown and smooth, gray bark. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and urban landscapes. Its rapid growth rate makes it a popular choice for ornamental planting, though it is susceptible to pests and diseases.",
