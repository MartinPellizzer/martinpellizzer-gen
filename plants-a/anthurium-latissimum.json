    "intro": "Anthurium latissimum, commonly known as the broadleaf anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, often with a glossy, dark green surface. The plant produces striking spadix inflorescences surrounded by a brightly colored spathe, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Anthurium latissimum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
