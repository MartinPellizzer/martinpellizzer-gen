    "intro": "Asplenium campus-portoi, commonly known as the rock spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, rounded groups called sorangia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in crevices. Asplenium campus-portoi is a low-maintenance plant that is well-suited for rock gardens or as a houseplant."
