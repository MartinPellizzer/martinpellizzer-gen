    "intro": "Armeria ruscinonensis, commonly known as the Ruscinonese thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has basal rosettes of narrow, linear leaves and produces flowering stems that rise above the foliage. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Armeria ruscinonensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy and drought-tolerant nature."
