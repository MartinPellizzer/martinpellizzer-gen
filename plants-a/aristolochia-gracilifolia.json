    "intro": "Aristolochia gracilifolia, commonly known as the slender-leaf Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, aromatic leaves and distinctive, tubular, purple-brown flowers that resemble a pipe. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow berries that contain the seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
