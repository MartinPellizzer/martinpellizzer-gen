    "intro": "Avena pubescens var. colorata, commonly known as the showy oat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant flower color and drought tolerance."
