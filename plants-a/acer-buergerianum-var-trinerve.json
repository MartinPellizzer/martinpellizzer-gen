    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer buergerianum var. trinerve is primarily native to the mountainous regions of eastern China, specifically in the provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Fujian. This variety is also found in parts of southern Korea and northern Vietnam. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is commonly found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters. The plant is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its native distribution is closely associated with the temperate forests of East Asia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer buergerianum var. trinerve was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental value, including its distinctive trifoliate leaves and vibrant fall coloration. It has been cultivated in both private and public landscapes for its aesthetic appeal. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts in non-native environments."
