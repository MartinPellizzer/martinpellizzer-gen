    "intro": "Arrhenatherum hispanicum, commonly known as Spanish flat sedge, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to wet soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is characterized by its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions and is often found in riparian habitats. Due to its ecological importance, it is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
