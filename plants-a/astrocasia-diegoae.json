    "intro": "Astrocasia diegoae, commonly known as Diego's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the Andes Mountains of Ecuador. It is characterized by its unique, elongated flower spike that bears a single, delicate white bloom with a subtle purple hue. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its roots are specialized for nutrient absorption in poor soils, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for survival. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, Astrocasia diegoae is considered critically endangered."
