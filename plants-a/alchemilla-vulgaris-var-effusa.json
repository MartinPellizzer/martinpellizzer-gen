    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. effusa, commonly known as the velvet cinquefoil, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with soft, hairy leaves that give it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and damp habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for ecological gardens and wetland restoration projects."
