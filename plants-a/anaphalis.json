    "intro": "Anaphalis, commonly known as the goatweed or frost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their woolly, silver-gray foliage and showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer. Anaphalis species are typically found in arid or rocky habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. The flowers often have a frost-like appearance, which is why they are sometimes called frost flowers. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
