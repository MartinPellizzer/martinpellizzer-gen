    "intro": "Atriplex babingtonii var. dumortieri, commonly known as the desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. This species is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for wildlife."
