    "intro": "Arctium foliosum, commonly known as the burdock plant, is a biennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically lobed. The plant produces purple flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by the distinctive spiky burrs that give it its common name. These burs contain seeds enclosed in a fibrous husk, which can adhere to animals and clothing, aiding in seed dispersal. Arctium foliosum is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in fields, and it has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
