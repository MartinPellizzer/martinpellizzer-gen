    "intro": "Asplenium wrightii, commonly known as Wright's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth pattern. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a smooth texture and often features a central vein. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its rhizomes help it anchor to bark or other substrates. Wright's spleenwort is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing on trees or rocks."
