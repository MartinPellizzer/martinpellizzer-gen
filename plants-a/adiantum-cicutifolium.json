    "intro": "Adiantum cicutifolium, commonly known as the water fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that resemble the structure of a fern's typical leaf. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in wetlands. Its leaves are typically bright green and have a distinctive, almost lace-like appearance. Adiantum cicutifolium is known for its ability to tolerate wet conditions, making it a popular choice for water gardens and bog landscapes.",
