    "intro": "Apinagia batrachiifolia f. longistyla, commonly known as the long-styled apinagia, is a rare and distinctive plant species belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered umbels of white to pale yellow flowers. The plant is native to specific regions in China, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its unique floral morphology, particularly the elongated staminodes, sets it apart from other members of the genus. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
