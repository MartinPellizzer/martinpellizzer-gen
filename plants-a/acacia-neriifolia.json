    "intro": "Acacia neriifolia, commonly known as the black-leaf acacia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its distinctive, dark green, almost black leaves that are narrow and linear. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in spherical clusters, which are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Acacia neriifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia neriifolia is primarily native to New South Wales and Queensland in Australia. It is commonly found in regions with a subtropical to tropical climate, particularly in areas with sandy or rocky soils. This species thrives in open woodlands, heathlands, and along coastal regions. It is well adapted to the variable rainfall patterns of its native habitat. Acacia neriifolia is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in supporting native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia neriifolia was mainly introduced to the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Haiti, and India. It was likely introduced for its ornamental value or for use in traditional medicine. The plant has established populations in these regions, sometimes becoming invasive. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species. Conservation efforts are being considered in some areas to manage its spread."
