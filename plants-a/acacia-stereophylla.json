    "intro": "Acacia stereophylla, commonly known as the slender wattle, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in cylindrical spikes, which bloom during the spring and summer seasons. Acacia stereophylla is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal and inland regions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia stereophylla is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in areas with sandy soils. This plant typically grows in coastal heathlands and open woodlands. It is well adapted to the dry and Mediterranean climate of its native habitat. Acacia stereophylla plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various native animals.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia stereophylla was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained sandy or loamy soils and a warm, temperate climate. It thrives in regions with moderate rainfall and full sun exposure. This plant is often found in coastal and inland dunes, as well as on rocky outcrops. Its ability to tolerate drought makes it suitable for reclamation projects in degraded lands. However, it may become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly."
