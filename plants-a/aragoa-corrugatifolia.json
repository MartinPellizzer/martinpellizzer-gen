    "intro": "Aragoa corrugatifolia, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, undulating fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds. Aragoa corrugatifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining soil stability."
