    "intro": "Arachnorchis integra, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the rainforests of eastern Australia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with long, slender sepals and petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a distinctive, intricate structure that aids in pollination by insects. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
