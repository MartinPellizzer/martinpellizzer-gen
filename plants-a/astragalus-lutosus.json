    "intro": "Astragalus lutosus, commonly known as the mud milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairie and steppe habitats. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor environments. Astragalus lutosus plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
