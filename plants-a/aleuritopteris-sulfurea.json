    "intro": "Aleuritopteris sulfurea, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of water fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are often covered in a yellowish or golden hue, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of its fronds. Aleuritopteris sulfurea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and indoor spaces."
