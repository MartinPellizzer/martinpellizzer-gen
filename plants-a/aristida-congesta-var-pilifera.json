    "intro": "Aristida congesta var. pilifera, commonly known as the hairy dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
