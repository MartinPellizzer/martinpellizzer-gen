It features prostrate stems that spread along the ground, often rooting at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by pod-like fruits containing one or two seeds. It is adapted to well-drained soils and thrives in warm, sunny environments. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for study in plant morphology and ecology."
