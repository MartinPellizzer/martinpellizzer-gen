    "intro": "Artemisia vexans, commonly known as bitterweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. It contains volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its strong medicinal and pesticidal properties. Artemisia vexans is also used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiparasitic effects."
