    "intro": "Allium thessalicum, commonly known as the Greek leek, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its long, grass-like leaves and clusters of white or purple flowers. The plant produces edible bulbs that are similar in taste to onions but have a milder, more delicate flavor. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Due to its ornamental value and culinary uses, Allium thessalicum is often cultivated in gardens across temperate climates."
