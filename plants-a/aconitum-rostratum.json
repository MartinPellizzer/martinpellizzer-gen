    "intro": "Aconitum rostratum, commonly known as the rostrate monkshood, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features showy, hooded blue-purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has palmately lobed, dark green leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in woodland settings. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
