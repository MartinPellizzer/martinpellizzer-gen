    "intro": "Argyrodendron trifoliolatum var. grandiflorum, commonly known as the large-flowered argyrodendron, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and striking, showy white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has trifoliate leaves, meaning each leaf is divided into three lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The flowers emit a subtle fragrance, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
