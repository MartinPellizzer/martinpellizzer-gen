    "intro": "Angraecum pellucidum, commonly known as the transparent angraecum, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, translucent white flowers that appear during the dry season. The plant's unique feature is its nectar-filled spathes, which are adapted to attract specific pollinators, such as the hawkmoth. Its epiphytic nature allows it to grow on trees, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. The species is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts due to its beauty and rarity."
