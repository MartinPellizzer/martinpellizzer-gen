    "intro": "Alisma plantago-aquatica var. michaletii, commonly known as the Michalet's water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are submerged or floating, and it produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize the soil and contributes to the ecological health of wetland habitats. This variety is distinguished by its specific morphological traits and geographic distribution compared to other variants of the species."
