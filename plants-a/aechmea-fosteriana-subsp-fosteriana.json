    "intro": "Aechmea fosteriana subsp. fosteriana, commonly known as the Foster's pineapple plant, is a bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. This species is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
