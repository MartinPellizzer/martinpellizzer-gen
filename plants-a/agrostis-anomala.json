    "intro": "Agrostis anomala, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 mm wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Agrostis anomala is valued for its use in turfgrass and as a forage crop for livestock."
