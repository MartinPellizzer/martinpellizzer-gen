    "intro": "Aglycia coarctata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved aglycia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. The plant features slender, upright stems with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Aglycia coarctata is characterized by its low-growing habit and is often found in association with other moisture-loving flora."
