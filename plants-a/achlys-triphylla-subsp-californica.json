    "intro": "Achlys triphylla subsp. californica, commonly known as the California three-leaf lily, is a rare and endangered perennial herb native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments, typically found in coastal scrub or woodland habitats. Its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements make it a subject of interest for conservation efforts. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it faces significant threats to its survival.",
