    "intro": "Allium caeruleum, commonly known as blue garlic, is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is a perennial herb characterized by its short, bulbous stem and clusters of blue to purple, spherical flowers. The plant produces small, white to yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the bulb is edible, though it has a milder flavor compared to common garlic. Allium caeruleum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
