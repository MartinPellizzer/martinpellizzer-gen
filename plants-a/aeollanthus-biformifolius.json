    "intro": "Aeollanthus biformifolius, commonly known as the two-leafed aeollanthus, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique leaf structure, with two distinct leaf forms on the same plant, a feature that sets it apart from most other species in the genus. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
