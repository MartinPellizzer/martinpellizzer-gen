It typically grows in open woodlands and prairies, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features narrow, bluish-green leaves with a rough, hairy texture, and its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. This grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in maintaining ecological balance in native habitats."
