    "intro": "Athyrium multicaudatum, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. The plant's ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in humid climates."
