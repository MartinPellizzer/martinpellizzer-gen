    "intro": "Aechmea prava, commonly known as the pink pineapple bromeliad, is a flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking pink or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. Aechmea prava is a popular ornamental plant due to its vibrant colors and relatively low maintenance requirements."
