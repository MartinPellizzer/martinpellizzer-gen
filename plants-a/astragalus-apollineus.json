It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Astragalus apollineus plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local pollinator populations."
