    "intro": "Amphiscopia lancifolia var. minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its foliage is often covered in fine, soft hairs, and it produces small, seed-like structures called cypselae. This variant is closely related to other members of the Asteraceae family and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
