    "intro": "Aechmea legrelliana, commonly known as the Red-tipped Pineapple Plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaf structure, which forms a central cup to collect rainwater. The leaves are typically dark green with red or purple markings, adding to its ornamental appeal. The plant produces an inflorescence with vibrant orange or red flowers, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
