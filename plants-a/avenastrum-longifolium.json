    "intro": "Avenastrum longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clustered inflorescences, which bloom in the summer months. Avenastrum longifolium is adapted to arid and rocky environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and deep root systems. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported antispasmodic and digestive properties."
