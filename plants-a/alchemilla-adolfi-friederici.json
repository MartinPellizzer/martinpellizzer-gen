    "intro": "Alchemilla adolfi-friederici, commonly known as the velvet cinquefoil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of soft, velvety, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and long blooming period."
