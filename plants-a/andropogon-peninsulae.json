    "intro": "Andropogon peninsulae, commonly known as the Florida panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. However, it is not commonly cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
