    "intro": "Asplenium escaleroense, commonly known as the Escalero spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the western United States. It typically grows on rock surfaces or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has finely divided, linear leaves that are often clustered closely together. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium escaleroense is characterized by its delicate appearance and preference for humid, cool microhabitats."
