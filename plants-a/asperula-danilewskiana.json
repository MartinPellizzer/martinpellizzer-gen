    "intro": "Asperula danilewskiana, commonly known as the Danilewskian azalea, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and rhododendrons, and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
