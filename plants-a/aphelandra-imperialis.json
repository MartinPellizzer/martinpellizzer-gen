    "intro": "Aphelandra imperialis, commonly known as the imperial flame plant, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves and its showy, orange-red bracts that resemble flowers. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are often hidden beneath the vibrant bracts. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and well-draining soil. Aphelandra imperialis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its dramatic appearance and ease of care."
