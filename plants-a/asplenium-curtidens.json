It is characterized by its delicate, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant is often found growing on rocks or in shaded, moist environments, showcasing its preference for humid, temperate climates. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in compact structures called sori. Asplenium curtidens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
