    "intro": "Atriplex spongiosa, commonly known as the spongebrush, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in desert environments. The plant is characterized by its silver-gray leaves, which are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs that help reduce water loss. Its small greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in dense spikes, and it produces small, dry fruits called capsules. Atriplex spongiosa is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness."
