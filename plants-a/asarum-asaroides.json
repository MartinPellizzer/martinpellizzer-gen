    "intro": "Asarum asaroides, commonly known as Chinese wild ginger, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and fragrant, spathaceous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system is often used in traditional medicine. However, it contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic and can cause serious health issues."
