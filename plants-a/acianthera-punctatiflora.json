    "intro": "Acianthera punctatiflora, commonly known as the spotted-flowered orchid, is a tropical orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit and its striking, fragrant flowers with a distinctive spotted pattern on the petals. The plant typically produces small, green leaves and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers, which bloom in spring, are often used in horticultural displays due to their ornamental value. Acianthera punctatiflora requires careful cultivation, as it is sensitive to environmental changes and prefers well-draining substrates.",
