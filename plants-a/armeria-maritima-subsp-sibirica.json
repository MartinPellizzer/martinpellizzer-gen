It features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils. It is often found in coastal and alpine environments due to its tolerance for harsh conditions. This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardiness."
