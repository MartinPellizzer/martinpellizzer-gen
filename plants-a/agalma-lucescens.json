    "intro": "Agalma lucescens, commonly known as the luminous ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that emit a faint bioluminescent glow under certain conditions. Native to the dense, humid rainforests of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in shaded, moist environments with high humidity. Its unique morphology includes a slender, thread-like stem and small, ephemeral flowers that bloom only briefly at night. Due to its elusive nature and habitat specificity, Agalma lucescens is considered critically endangered and is rarely encountered in the wild."
