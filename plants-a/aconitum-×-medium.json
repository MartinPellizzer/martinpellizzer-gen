It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, pleated, hood-shaped flowers that are typically blue to purple in color. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, almost palmate appearance. Aconitum \u00d7 medium is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value, though it contains toxic alkaloids and should be handled with care.",
