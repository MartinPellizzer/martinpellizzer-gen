It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant features striking blue or purple spurred flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape, which is a defining feature of the genus Aconitum. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed segments that give it a distinctive appearance. Aconitum rectissimum contains toxic alkaloids, making it a plant that requires caution when handling.",
