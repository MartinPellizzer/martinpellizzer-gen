    "intro": "Aquilegia speciosa var. bicolor, commonly known as the showy lady's mantle, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its showy, spurred flowers that come in a mix of pink and white, creating a bicolor effect. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with fern-like, bipinnate leaves that are hairy and gray-green in color. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, often found in alpine and woodland habitats. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
