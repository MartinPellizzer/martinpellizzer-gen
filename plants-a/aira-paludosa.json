    "intro": "Aira paludosa, commonly known as swamp air\u9ecd, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshes, bogs, and other moist environments, often forming dense stands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are often wind-pollinated. Its roots are adapted to waterlogged soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Aira paludosa is also an important food source for various wildlife species."
