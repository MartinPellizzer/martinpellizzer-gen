    "intro": "Asperula aristata var. canescens, commonly known as the hairy woodruff, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It features small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. The plant has glossy, dark green leaves that are typically covered in fine, hairy textures, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its pleasant aroma, which is released when the leaves are crushed."
