    "intro": "Atriplex elegans subsp. thornberi, commonly known as Thornberg's saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, gray-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is often found growing in saline soils. Its adaptability to poor soil conditions makes it an important component of desert ecosystems. Atriplex elegans subsp. thornberi plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
