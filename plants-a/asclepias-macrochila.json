    "intro": "Asclepias macrochila, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap, which is typical of the Asclepias genus and contains toxic compounds. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Asclepias macrochila serves as a vital host plant for monarch butterfly larvae, making it ecologically significant in supporting pollinators and native wildlife."
