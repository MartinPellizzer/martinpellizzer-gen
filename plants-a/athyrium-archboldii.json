    "intro": "Athyrium archboldii, commonly known as the Archbold's fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky areas. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Athyrium archboldii is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
