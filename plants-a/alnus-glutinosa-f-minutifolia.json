    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa f. minutifolia, commonly known as the dwarf alder, is a compact shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of the European continent. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are dark green on top and pale underneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellowish catkins in early spring, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
