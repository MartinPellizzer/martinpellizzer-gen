    "intro": "Aostea helenae, commonly known as the Helen's aostea, is a rare alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy foliage. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in rocky and gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
