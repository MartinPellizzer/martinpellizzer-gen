It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Astragalus splendens is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native environment."
