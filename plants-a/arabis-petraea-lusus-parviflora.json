    "intro": "Arabis petraea lusus parviflora, commonly known as the rock\u767d\u83dc or rock cabbage, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
