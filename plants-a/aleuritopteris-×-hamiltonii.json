    "intro": "Aleuritopteris \u00d7 hamiltonii, commonly known as the hybrid water fern, is a fern species that results from the cross between Aleuritopteris pterodonta and Aleuritopteris yokoi. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into narrow, feather-like segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce adventitious roots, which help anchor it in wet soils. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which aids in water retention."
