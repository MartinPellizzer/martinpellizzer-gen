    "intro": "Annona ulei, commonly known as the Brazilian pawpaw, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Annonaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, followed by spherical fruits with a yellowish, sweet-smelling pulp. The fruit is edible, though its taste is often described as bland or slightly acidic, and it is sometimes used in local cuisines. Annona ulei is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in some tropical gardens."
