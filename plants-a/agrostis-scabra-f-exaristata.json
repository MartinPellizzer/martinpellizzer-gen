    "intro": "Agrostis scabra f. exaristata, commonly known as the scaly bentgrass, is a variant of the bentgrass species characterized by its distinctive scaly appearance on the leaf blades. This plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is a low-growing perennial grass with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The foliage is often covered with fine, bristly hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. It is often found in meadows, lawns, and disturbed sites, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and ecological diversity."
