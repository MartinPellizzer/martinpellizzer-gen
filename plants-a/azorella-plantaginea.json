    "intro": "Azorella plantaginea, commonly known as the Andean mat grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in a thick layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Azorella plantaginea is adapted to cold, arid conditions and thrives in alpine and subalpine zones. Its ability to survive in extreme climates makes it an important component of the mountainous ecosystems it inhabits."
