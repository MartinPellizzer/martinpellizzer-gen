    "intro": "Acantholimon hilariae, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in arid and rocky habitats, often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Acantholimon hilariae plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native environment and is of interest to botanists studying adaptation to harsh climates.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon hilariae is primarily native to Afghanistan and Tadzhikistan. This plant is found in the mountainous regions of these countries. It thrives in rocky and arid environments. The species is part of the Caryophyllaceae family. Its native distribution is limited to these specific areas in Central Asia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon hilariae was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or gravelly soils in arid and semi-arid environments. It is commonly found in regions such as California, Nevada, and Oregon in the United States. This plant thrives in full sun and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for disturbed or dry landscapes. Its distribution is often associated with coastal dunes and inland salt flats. Due to its hardy nature, it has become an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation."
