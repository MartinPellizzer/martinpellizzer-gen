    "intro": "Agrostemma triflorum, commonly known as the three-flowered gothic grass, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces three to five flowers per stem, which are clustered in a spike-like arrangement. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its common name. Agrostemma triflorum is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
