    "intro": "Andropogon bentii, commonly known as narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments. Andropogon bentii plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
