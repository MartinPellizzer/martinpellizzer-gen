    "intro": "Alyssum maritimum f. crassifolium, commonly known as the thick-leaved sea thrift, is a compact, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are thick, succulent, and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to retain moisture in salty, windy environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in coastal landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value. This variety is a popular choice for rock gardens and seaside gardens due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal."
