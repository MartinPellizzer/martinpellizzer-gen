    "intro": "Andropogon obtusus, commonly known as bluntleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and pond edges, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments. Andropogon obtusus plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
