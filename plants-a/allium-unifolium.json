The plant's bulbs are often used in culinary applications, though they are less common than other onion varieties. Botanically, it belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its fibrous roots and fleshy, underground storage organs. Its growth cycle involves a period of dormancy followed by rapid growth and flowering in the spring."
