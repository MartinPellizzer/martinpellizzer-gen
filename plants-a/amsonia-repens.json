    "intro": "Amsonia repens, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking blue-gray foliage and delicate, mist-like blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for native gardens. Its drought tolerance and ability to spread via rhizomes contribute to its hardiness and adaptability. Amsonia repens is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators and supporting local wildlife."
