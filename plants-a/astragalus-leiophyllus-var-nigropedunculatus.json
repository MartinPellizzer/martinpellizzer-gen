    "intro": "Astragalus leiophyllus var. nigropedunculatus, commonly known as the black-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval leaflets that help reduce water loss. This variant is distinguished by its dark-colored peduncles, which give it its common name."
