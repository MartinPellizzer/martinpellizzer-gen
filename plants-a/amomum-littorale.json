It is a member of the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and clustered, spadix-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments near water bodies, such as rivers and coastal areas. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. The plant's unique fragrance and medicinal potential make it an important species in both ecological and cultural contexts."
