    "intro": "Arundinaria melanostachys, commonly known as black bamboo, is a species of grass native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks that can reach heights of up to 10 meters. The plant produces small, dark purple to black flowers that appear in panicles during the spring. Its culms are strong and flexible, making it suitable for use in basket weaving and construction. Black bamboo thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight."
