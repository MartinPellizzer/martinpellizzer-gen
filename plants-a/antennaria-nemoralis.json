    "intro": "Antennaria nemoralis, commonly known as the wood mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically clustered at the base, giving it a compact appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its flowers bloom in early spring, producing yellowish to pale pink petals and contributing to the plant's ecological role in supporting pollinators."
