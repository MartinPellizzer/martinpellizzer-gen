It thrives in rocky soils and is commonly found in desert environments. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climate of the region. Its distribution is limited to specific locations within Mexico's southwestern states.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthocereus tepalcatepecanus was mainly introduced to regions with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in areas with low rainfall and high temperatures, making it suitable for xerophytic environments. This plant is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes as an ornamental species due to its unique appearance. Its introduction has been primarily for horticultural purposes rather than for ecological or agricultural reasons. However, its spread in non-native regions requires monitoring to prevent potential ecological impacts."
