    "intro": "Astragalus pinonis, commonly known as the mountain milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Astragalus pinonis is known for its deep root system, which helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local biodiversity in its native range."
