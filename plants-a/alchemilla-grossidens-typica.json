    "intro": "Alchemilla grossidens typica, commonly known as the velvetleaf lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, velvety green leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in loose, open panicles. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported soothing and anti-inflammatory properties. Alchemilla grossidens typica thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
