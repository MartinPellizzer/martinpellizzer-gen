    "intro": "Antennaria plantaginifolia var. petiolata, commonly known as the hairy cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous slender, hairy stems that produce small, white or pale yellow flowers. The leaves are typically opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and covered with fine, soft hairs. This variety is characterized by its petioled leaves, which distinguish it from other varieties of the same species. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments."
