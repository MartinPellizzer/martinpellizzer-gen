    "intro": "Astragalus fraxinella, commonly known as yellow milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, and it thrives in well-drained soils. It is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Astragalus fraxinella plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment."
