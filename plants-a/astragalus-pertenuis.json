    "intro": "Astragalus pertenuis, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. It produces small, bean-shaped pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus pertenuis is a perennial plant that is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
