    "intro": "Aristolochia incisa, commonly known as the narrowleaf Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and its unique, pipe-shaped flowers that are often purple or greenish in color. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, white aril. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
