    "intro": "Aster boergeri, commonly known as the Boerger's aster, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its showy purple or pink flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Aster boergeri is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
