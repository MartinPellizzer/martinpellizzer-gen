    "intro": "Allium caerulescens, commonly known as blue garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, bulbous structures similar to garlic, which are edible and have a mild garlic flavor. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or borders. Allium caerulescens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
