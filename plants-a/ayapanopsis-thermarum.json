    "intro": "Ayapanopsis thermarum, commonly known as the hot spring ayapanopsis, is a rare and unique plant species native to the volcanic regions of Costa Rica. It thrives in geothermal environments, where it utilizes the heat from hot springs to maintain its metabolic processes. This plant is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and delicate, white flowers that bloom in the early morning. Its botanical adaptations include specialized root systems that absorb minerals from the mineral-rich soil. Ayapanopsis thermarum plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its habitat, supporting a variety of microorganisms and invertebrates."
