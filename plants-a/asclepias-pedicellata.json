    "intro": "Asclepias pedicellata, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the United States and Mexico. It is characterized by its striking pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many animals but serve as a defense mechanism. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, with a hairy texture. Asclepias pedicellata plays a vital role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae."
