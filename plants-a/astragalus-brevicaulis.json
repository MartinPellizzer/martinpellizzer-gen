    "intro": "Astragalus brevicaulis, commonly known as the short-horned milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to harsh environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Astragalus brevicaulis plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinators."
