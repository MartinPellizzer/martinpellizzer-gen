It is a herbaceous annual that produces vibrant pink to red flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer. The plant has thin, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cool, moist climate of its mountainous habitat. Anagallis kilimandscharica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with similar growing conditions."
