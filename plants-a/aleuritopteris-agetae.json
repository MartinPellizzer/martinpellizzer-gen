    "intro": "Aleuritopteris agetae, commonly known as the Japanese cliff brake, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and deeply divided. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Aleuritopteris agetae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy and adaptable nature."
