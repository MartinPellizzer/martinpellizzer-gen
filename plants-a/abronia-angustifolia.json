    "intro": "Abronia angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. It is often found in coastal dunes and scrub habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some regions and is protected in several states.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abronia angustifolia is primarily native to Arizona, Mexico Northeast, New Mexico, and Texas. This species is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often in desert scrub habitats. The plant is well adapted to the hot and dry climate of its native range. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abronia angustifolia was mainly introduced to specific regions in the United States, particularly in California and Oregon, where it has been observed in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and sandy soils. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. The plant's introduction is believed to have occurred through human activities, including landscaping and accidental seed dispersal. Its distribution has expanded beyond its native range, leading to ecological concerns in local ecosystems. Efforts are ongoing to monitor and manage its spread to protect native plant communities."
