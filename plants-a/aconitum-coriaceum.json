    "intro": "Aconitum coriaceum, commonly known as the rough helmet or European aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and eastern Europe. It features a tall, unbranched stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with palmately compound leaves that have a rough, textured surface. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in a spire-like inflorescence. Its roots contain potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling. Aconitum coriaceum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats.",
