It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant contains volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its medicinal properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its chemical composition, it has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a source of the active ingredient in some antimalarial drugs."
