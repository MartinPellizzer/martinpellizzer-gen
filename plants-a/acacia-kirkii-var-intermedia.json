    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia kirkii var. intermedia is primarily native to eastern and southern Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and parts of South Africa. It is commonly found in savannas, woodlands, and rocky outcrops where the climate is warm and semi-arid. This variant of Acacia kirkii thrives in regions with well-drained soils and is often part of the vegetation in dry woodland ecosystems. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is often used in traditional medicine by local communities. The plant plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various animals.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia kirkii var. intermedia was mainly introduced to areas with a tropical and subtropical climate, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of eastern and southern Africa, including countries like Kenya, Tanzania, and Mozambique. This plant is often used for its hardy nature and ability to withstand drought conditions. Its introduction has been primarily for ornamental purposes and as a source of timber. However, it can also become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly."
