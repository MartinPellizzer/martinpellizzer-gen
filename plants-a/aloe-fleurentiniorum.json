    "intro": "Aloe fleurentiniorum, commonly known as the Cape aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched flower stalks that bear orange or yellow flowers, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its resilience and ornamental value make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
