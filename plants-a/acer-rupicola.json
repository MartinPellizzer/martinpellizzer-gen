    "intro": "Acer rupicola, commonly known as the rock maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree typically grows on rocky slopes and cliffs, adapting to harsh, well-drained soils. Its small, bright red fruits are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acer rupicola is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.",
