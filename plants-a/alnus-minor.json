    "intro": "Alnus minor, commonly known as the European alder, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-trunked form and its delicate, feathery leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, cone-like fruits that are dispersed by wind, and it has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root system. Alnus minor thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Its rapid growth and ability to improve soil quality make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
