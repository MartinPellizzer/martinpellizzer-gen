    "intro": "Alternanthera microphylla subsp. microphylla, commonly known as red veined sorrel, is a striking aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves with bright red veins that contrast sharply with its dark green foliage. The plant thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters and requires moderate to high light conditions for optimal growth. It is often cultivated in ponds and water gardens for its ornamental value. Its rapid growth rate makes it a popular choice for both natural and artificial aquatic environments."
