    "intro": "Areca ilsemannii, commonly known as the Ilsemann\u2019s areca, is a species of palm native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of many palm species. Its fruit is a three-lobed berry that turns from green to red as it matures. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
