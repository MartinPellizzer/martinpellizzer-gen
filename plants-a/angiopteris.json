    "intro": "Angiopteris, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Angiopteridaceae. These plants are characterized by their large, feathery fronds that often resemble those of more primitive ferns. Angiopteris species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments. They have a unique reproductive system involving spores, which are produced on the underside of their fronds. The genus is notable for its ancient lineage, with some species dating back to the Mesozoic era."
