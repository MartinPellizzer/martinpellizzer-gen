    "intro": "Agave phillipsiana, commonly known as the pineapple agave, is a perennial plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are lined with sharp spines. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with yellow-green flowers, which bloom in the spring. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its succulent leaves store water, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping."
