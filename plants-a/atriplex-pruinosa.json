    "intro": "Atriplex pruinosa, commonly known as Pruinose Saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor, saline soils. Atriplex pruinosa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for wildlife."
