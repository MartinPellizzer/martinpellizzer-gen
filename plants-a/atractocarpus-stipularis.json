    "intro": "Atractocarpus stipularis, commonly known as the stipulate sycamore, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its distinctive stipules, which are small, leaf-like structures at the base of its petioles. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are often palmately lobed, and it produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it thrives in humid, tropical environments. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
