It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow petals and intricate floral structure. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom in clusters and are pollinated primarily by insects such as bees and wasps. Anneslia guildingii is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting pollinator populations."
