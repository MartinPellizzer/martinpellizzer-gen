    "intro": "Astragalus calavriformis, commonly known as the horned milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils, often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are generally trifoliate, with three leaflets. Astragalus calavriformis is characterized by its unique, horn-like seed pods that give it its common name. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
