    "intro": "Arbutus unedo var. salicifolia, commonly known as the willow-leaf strawberry tree, is a variant of the strawberry tree native to the western Mediterranean. It is characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, edible berries that ripen in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and woodland areas. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits in native habitats."
