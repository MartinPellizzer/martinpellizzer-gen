    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena pennatula is primarily native to New Zealand. It is commonly found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury and Otago regions. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as tussock grasslands and rocky outcrops. It is well adapted to the temperate climate and nutrient-poor soils of these areas. Acaena pennatula plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena pennatula was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive silver foliage and flowering habit. However, it has since become invasive, spreading aggressively in native ecosystems. The plant competes with native species for resources and can alter soil structure, impacting biodiversity. Its distribution is now widespread across various habitats in New Zealand."
