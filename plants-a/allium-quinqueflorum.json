It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, umbel-like inflorescence that bears five to seven white or pale purple flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, bulbous structures at its base. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is also cultivated for its potential health benefits."
