    "intro": "Avena pendula, commonly known as the oat grass, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, drooping stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it has fibrous roots that help stabilize soil. Avena pendula is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and its ability to prevent erosion."
