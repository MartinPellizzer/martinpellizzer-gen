    "intro": "Auricula-ursi glaucescens, commonly known as the blue bear's ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features a rosette of dark green, hairy leaves that are often tinged with a bluish hue. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with specific horticultural care."
