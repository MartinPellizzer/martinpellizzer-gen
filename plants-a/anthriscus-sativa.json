It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white or greenish-white flowers that form umbrella-shaped clusters. The plant typically grows to a height of 60\u2013120 cm and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been naturalized in many regions around the world. Anthriscus sativa is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed sites, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
