    "intro": "Agalinis keyensis, commonly known as Keyleaf false foxglove, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and pine flatwoods. Its flowers are tubular and typically pink or purple, with two lips that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Agalinis keyensis is relatively short-lived, often persisting for only one to two years, and is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
