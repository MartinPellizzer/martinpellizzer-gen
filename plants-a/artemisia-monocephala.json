It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees. Artemisia monocephala is often used in traditional medicine for its purported antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it a resilient species in its native habitat."
