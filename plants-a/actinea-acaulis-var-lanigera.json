    "intro": "Actinea acaulis var. lanigera, commonly known as the woolly star, is a rare and striking perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a soft, fluffy appearance, particularly on the undersides of its leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to its overall appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",
