    "intro": "Astragalus mollissimus var. irolanus, commonly known as the softleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
