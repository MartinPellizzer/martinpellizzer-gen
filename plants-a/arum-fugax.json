    "intro": "Arum fugax, commonly known as the transient arum, is a herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix and a spathe. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Its leaves are usually broad and arrow-shaped, with a deep green color and a slightly rough texture. Arum fugax is known for its short blooming period, which contributes to its common name, reflecting its ephemeral presence in the botanical landscape."
