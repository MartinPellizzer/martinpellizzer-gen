    "intro": "Abrotanum incanescens, commonly known as white thorn or wild mignonette, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub characterized by its hairy, grayish-green foliage and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and sometimes invasive species in certain environments.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abrotanum incanescens is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. It thrives in humid, shaded environments within the Atlantic Forest and Amazonian lowlands. This plant is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in forest understories. It is also present in parts of Central America, including Panama and Costa Rica. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrotanum incanescens was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its attractive silver foliage and drought tolerance. It has since spread beyond its original introduction range, becoming naturalized in parts of southern Europe and North Africa. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often colonizing disturbed soils and rocky areas. Its rapid growth and ability to reproduce both sexually and vegetatively contribute to its invasive potential in some areas. However, it is not considered highly invasive and is often managed through controlled planting and monitoring."
