It features broad, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly serrated edge. This variety is well-suited for aquariums due to its tolerance for low light and minimal maintenance requirements. The plant grows slowly and can be propagated through stem cuttings. Its dense foliage provides excellent habitat for small aquatic organisms."
