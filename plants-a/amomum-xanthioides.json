    "intro": "Amomum xanthioides, commonly known as the yellow cardamom or wild cardamom, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its tall, herbaceous stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by aromatic, three-lobed berries. Its rhizomes, similar to ginger, are often used in traditional medicine and as a spice. Amomum xanthioides is valued for its fragrant properties and is cultivated for both ornamental and practical purposes."
