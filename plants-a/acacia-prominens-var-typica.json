    "intro": "Acacia prominens var. typica, commonly known as the typical wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated phyllodes that are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads, which are typical of the Acacia genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. This species is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia prominens var. typica is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and parts of South Africa. It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in savanna and shrubland habitats. This variety is well adapted to dry conditions and can tolerate high temperatures and limited rainfall. It plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for local wildlife. Its distribution is largely restricted to the western and central parts of the African continent.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia prominens var. typica was mainly introduced to the western regions of South Africa, particularly in the Karoo and adjacent areas. It is commonly found in sandy soils and rocky outcrops, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its deep root system and ability to stabilize soil. It has also been introduced to other parts of the world as an ornamental species because of its attractive foliage and resilience. However, its spread has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in non-native habitats."
