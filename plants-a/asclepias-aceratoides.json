    "intro": "Asclepias aceratoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. It plays a crucial role in the life cycle of the monarch butterfly, providing a host plant for their eggs and a food source for their larvae. Asclepias aceratoides thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas."
