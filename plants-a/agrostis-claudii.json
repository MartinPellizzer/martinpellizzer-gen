    "intro": "Agrostis claudii, commonly known as Claud's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted shoots with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is usually short and compact. Agrostis claudii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
