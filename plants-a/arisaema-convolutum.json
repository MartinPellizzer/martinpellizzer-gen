    "intro": "Arisaema convolutum, commonly known as the twisted arisaema, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant produces striking, often colorful bracts that serve to attract pollinators. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. The species is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its traditional uses in herbal medicine."
