    "intro": "Alatiliparis otochilus, commonly known as the Otochilus orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has a compact growth habit with narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires specific conditions to flourish, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
