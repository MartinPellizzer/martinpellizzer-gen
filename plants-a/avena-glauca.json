    "intro": "Avena glauca, commonly known as blue oatgrass, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, blue-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas. Avena glauca is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone regions."
