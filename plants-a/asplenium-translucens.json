    "intro": "Asplenium translucens, commonly known as the translucent spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often translucent or semi-transparent, giving it its common name. Its fronds are usually dark green with a waxy coating, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorangia. Asplenium translucens is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in high humidity and indirect light."
