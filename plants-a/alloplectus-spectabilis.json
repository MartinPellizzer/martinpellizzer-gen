    "intro": "Alloplectus spectabilis, commonly known as the showy sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically succulent and covered in fine hairs, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. Alloplectus spectabilis is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along dry slopes and rocky areas."
