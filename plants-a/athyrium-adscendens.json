    "intro": "Athyrium adscendens, commonly known as the ascending fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia on the undersides of its leaves. Athyrium adscendens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
