It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow to reddish-purple flowers arranged in dense clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Astragalus brevidentatus is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a food source for wildlife."
