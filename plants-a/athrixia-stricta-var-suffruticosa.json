It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy, gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
