    "intro": "Artemisia maritima subsp. gallica, commonly known as sea wormwood, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its leaves contain volatile oils, which contribute to its strong, medicinal scent. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and its historical use in herbal medicine."
