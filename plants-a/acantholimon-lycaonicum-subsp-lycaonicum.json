    "intro": "Acantholimon lycaonicum subsp. lycaonicum, commonly known as the Lycaonicum thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of blue or purple flowers. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.",

This subspecies is found in specific regions of Turkey, particularly in the eastern and central parts of the country. It thrives in rocky and semi-arid environments, often growing on slopes and in mountainous areas. The plant is adapted to the local climate and soil conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is limited to these specific areas within Turkey, reflecting its ecological preferences.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon lycaonicum subsp. lycaonicum was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region, particularly in southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is commonly found in rocky soils and dry habitats, often growing on slopes and cliffs. This subspecies is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in such conditions. Its introduction has been associated with both natural dispersal and human activities, including horticultural use. However, it is not considered invasive and is generally limited to its native range."
