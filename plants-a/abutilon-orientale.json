    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon orientale is primarily native to Guatemala, Mexico Northwest, Mexico Southeast, and Mexico Southwest. This plant is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these areas. It thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils. Abutilon orientale is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found in open woodlands and along roadsides. Its native range reflects its adaptability to diverse environmental conditions within these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon orientale was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-like flowers. It was also introduced to parts of Florida and other tropical regions in the United States. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed habitats have led to its establishment in natural areas. However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions because of its competitive nature. Despite its ornamental value, its spread requires careful management to prevent ecological impact."
