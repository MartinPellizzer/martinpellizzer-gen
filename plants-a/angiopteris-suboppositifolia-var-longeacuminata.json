    "intro": "Angiopteris suboppositifolia var. longeacuminata, commonly known as the long-acuminate water fern, is a rare variant of the water fern genus Angiopteris. It is characterized by its large, deeply divided fronds that are often semi-ferns with a distinctive, elongated acuminate shape at the tips of the pinnae. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense forest understories. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of the fern family. This variant is notable for its unique morphology and is of interest to botanists studying fern diversity and evolution."
