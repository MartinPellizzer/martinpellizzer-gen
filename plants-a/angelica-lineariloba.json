    "intro": "Angelica lineariloba, commonly known as the slender angelica, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in compound umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, aromatic scent when crushed. Angelica lineariloba is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory benefits."
