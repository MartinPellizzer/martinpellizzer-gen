    "intro": "Achoriphragma fruticulosum, commonly known as the hairy-fruited achoriphragma, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a ornamental plant.",
