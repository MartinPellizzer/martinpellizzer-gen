    "intro": "Austrobuxus pisocarpus, commonly known as the Tasmanian holly, is a species of evergreen shrub native to Tasmania. It belongs to the family Aquifoliaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Austrobuxus pisocarpus is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its slow growth rate and ornamental value make it a popular choice for horticultural use in temperate regions."
