    "intro": "Allophylus rubifolius var. rhusiphyllus, commonly known as the red-leaf alder, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically red or reddish-brown in color, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by winged fruits that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its ornamental value is appreciated in horticulture due to its striking foliage and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
