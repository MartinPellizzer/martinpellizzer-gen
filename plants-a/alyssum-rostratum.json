    "intro": "Alyssum rostratum, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a low-growing annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and are typically borne on slender, branching stems. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats. Alyssum rostratum is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in desert ecosystems."
