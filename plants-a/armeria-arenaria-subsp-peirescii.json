    "intro": "Armeria arenaria subsp. peirescii, commonly known as the sand armeria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe. It features compact, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, adapted to withstand harsh, saline environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or rocky coastal areas. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with similar conditions."
