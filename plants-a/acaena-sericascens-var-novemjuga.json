    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena sericascens var. novemjuga is primarily native to the South Island of New Zealand. It is commonly found in the coastal and lowland areas, particularly in the Canterbury and Otago regions. This variety thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with coastal dunes and rocky outcrops. It is a low-growing shrub that produces small, spiny fruits. The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate and salt-laden winds of its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena sericascens var. novemjuga was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the early European settlement and has since become naturalized in various regions. This plant is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, particularly in the South Island. It thrives in temperate climates and is often seen in dry, open habitats. Despite its introduction, it has not become invasive and is considered a minor component of the local flora."
