    "intro": "Artemisia decaisnei, commonly known as the Decaisne's wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its leaves contain volatile oils, giving it a strong, bitter scent and making it a valued species in traditional medicine. Due to its hardiness and ornamental qualities, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
