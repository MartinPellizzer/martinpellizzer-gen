    "intro": "Alchemilla rhododendrophila, commonly known as the rhododendron alchemilla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring. Its leaves are hairy and have a distinctive silver-green appearance, which helps it thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. Alchemilla rhododendrophila is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in garden settings."
