    "intro": "Asplenium paucijugum, commonly known as the few-lobed spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in small, rounded structures called sorus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Asplenium paucijugum is well adapted to humid climates and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
