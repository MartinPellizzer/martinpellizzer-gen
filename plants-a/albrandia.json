    "intro": "Albrandia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pale pink or white petals that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous fruits that contain seeds with a unique, waxy coating. Albrandia thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species."
