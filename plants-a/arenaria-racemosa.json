    "intro": "Arenaria racemosa, commonly known as sand pink, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in the summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has a low-growing habit with dense, mat-forming foliage that helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. Its leaves are typically blue-green in color and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which reduce water loss. Arenaria racemosa is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions."
