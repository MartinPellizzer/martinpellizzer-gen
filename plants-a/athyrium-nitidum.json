    "intro": "Athyrium nitidum, commonly known as the shining male fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium nitidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
