    "intro": "Alsophila glauca, commonly known as the blue hakea, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, dark green fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for many decades, making it a long-lived component of its native ecosystem. Its fronds are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the trunk, and the plant produces spores in clusters on the undersides of its leaves. Alsophila glauca thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and forested areas."
