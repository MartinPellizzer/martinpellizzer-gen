    "intro": "Ayenia pescapraeifolia, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and large, showy flowers that bloom in shades of red, pink, and white. The leaves are typically ovate or elliptical, with a slightly hairy surface. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found along the seashore, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. This plant plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
