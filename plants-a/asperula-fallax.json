    "intro": "Asperula fallax, commonly known as the evergreen wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it ideal for woodland gardens. Asperula fallax is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide early seasonal color in gardens."
