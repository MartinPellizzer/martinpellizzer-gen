It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, blade-like leaves with distinctive white margins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects."
