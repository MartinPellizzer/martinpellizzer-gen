    "intro": "Arenaria grandiflora var. stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and fleshy, adapted to conserve moisture in arid environments. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
