    "intro": "Aubertia glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that often exude a sticky substance. The plant produces small, pale purple to white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its reproductive success in arid environments. Aubertia glandulosa is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
