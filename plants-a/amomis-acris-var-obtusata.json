    "intro": "Amomis acris var. obtusata, commonly known as the bluntleaf panicled grass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit with narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically greenish or pale yellow in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its broader, more rounded leaf tips compared to other varieties of Amomis acris."
