    "intro": "Arctostaphylos franciscana, commonly known as the Franciscan manzanita, is a shrub native to California's coastal regions. It is characterized by its dense, reddish-brown bark and small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
