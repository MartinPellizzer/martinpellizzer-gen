    "intro": "Agropyron subulatum, commonly known as the needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. Agropyron subulatum is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and prevent erosion."
