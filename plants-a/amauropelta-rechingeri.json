    "intro": "Amauropelta rechingeri, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing on cliffs or in crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Amauropelta rechingeri is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
