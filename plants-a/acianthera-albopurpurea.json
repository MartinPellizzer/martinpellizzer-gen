It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that display a combination of white and purple hues. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they attach to tree trunks without parasitizing them. The flowers bloom during the warmer months, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies.",
