    "intro": "Acanthodesmos distichus, commonly known as the two-ranked acanthodesmos, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed-like species. The plant is characterized by its opposite, linear leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in shrublands and coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat.",

This plant thrives in sandy soils and often grows in disturbed or open habitats. It is an important component of the local flora in Jamaica's coastal ecosystems. Its distribution is limited to the Caribbean region, with Jamaica being its primary habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthodesmos distichus was mainly introduced to the eastern coast of Australia, particularly in New South Wales and Queensland. It is commonly found in coastal dunes and sandy soils, where it thrives in well-drained conditions. The plant is often associated with disturbed sites, including roadsides and agricultural areas. It has become a common weed in these regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds. Despite its invasive tendencies, it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small fauna."
