    "intro": "Aspidium triangulum subsp. latipinnum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green and have a distinctive, triangular shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant. The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
