    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abromeitiella lotteae is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern California, specifically in the vicinity of the Santa Barbara Channel. It is commonly found in sandy or gravelly habitats along the shoreline. This plant thrives in areas with mild, Mediterranean-type climates and is often associated with dune or beach environments. It is considered a rare and endemic species, with limited distribution along the Pacific coast. Due to its restricted range, it is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abromeitiella lotteae was mainly introduced to coastal areas of South Korea, particularly in the Jeju Island region. It thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found in dune environments. The plant was likely introduced through human activity, such as accidental transport via vehicles or cargo. It has become a common sight in coastal landscapes, sometimes displacing native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems."
