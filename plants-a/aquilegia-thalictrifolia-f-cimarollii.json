    "intro": "Aquilegia thalictrifolia f. cimarollii, commonly known as the Cimarolli's columbine, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Italy. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its spurred petals and vibrant blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky soils, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its foliage consists of finely divided, fern-like leaves, and it produces seed pods that split open to release tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
