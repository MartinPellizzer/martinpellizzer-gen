    "intro": "Aegilops geniculata, commonly known as the goat grass, is a wild relative of wheat that belongs to the Poaceae family. It is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Central Asia. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm, with slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are spike-like, with small, two-lobed glumes that enclose the florets. Aegilops geniculata is valued in agricultural research for its potential contributions to wheat improvement through genetic diversity."
