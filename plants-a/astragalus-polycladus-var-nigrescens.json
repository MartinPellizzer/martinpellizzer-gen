It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems that turn dark purple or black with age, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being narrow and slightly hairy. This species is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats."
