    "intro": "Ajuga pygmaea, commonly known as carpet bugle or dwarf bugle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to eastern North America. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, sky-blue to violet flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Ajuga pygmaea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in moist habitats."
