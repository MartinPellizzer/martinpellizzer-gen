    "intro": "Astragalus yueksekovae, commonly known as the Yueksekov's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor and drought-prone environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
