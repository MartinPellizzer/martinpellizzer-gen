    "intro": "Arenaria stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. The plant has small, alternate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, clustered in racemes, and bloom in late summer. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its cold, high-altitude habitat."
