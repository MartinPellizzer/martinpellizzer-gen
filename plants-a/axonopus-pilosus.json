    "intro": "Axonopus pilosus, commonly known as velvetgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has fine, soft, and densely packed foliage that gives it a velvety appearance. The plant typically forms dense mats or cushions, often carpeting the ground in shaded or moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its textured look. Axonopus pilosus is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
