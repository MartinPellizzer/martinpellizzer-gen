    "intro": "Aconitum stylosum, commonly known as the alpine aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant features large, showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed divisions, and the plant is known for its toxic alkaloids, which make it highly poisonous to both animals and humans. Aconitum stylosum thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.",
