It belongs to the family Restionaceae, which includes many grass-like plants adapted to arid environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, wiry stems and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or brown in color. Actinophlebia horrida is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in regions with low rainfall.",
