    "intro": "Agrimonia pubescens, commonly known as rough agrimony, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in dry grasslands, woodlands, and along roadsides, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant features upright stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are deeply lobed with a rough texture. Its yellow flowers, which appear in late summer, are clustered in dense heads and are followed by small, dry fruits. Agrimonia pubescens has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and astringent properties."
