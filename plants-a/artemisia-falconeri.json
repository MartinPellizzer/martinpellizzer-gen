    "intro": "Artemisia falconeri, commonly known as the Falkland Islands wormwood, is a flowering plant native to the Falkland Islands. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the harsh, windy conditions of its habitat. The plant has aromatic, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Artemisia falconeri plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is also used in traditional medicine by the islanders."
