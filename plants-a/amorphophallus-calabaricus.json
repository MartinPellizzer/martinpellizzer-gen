It is characterized by its large, tuberous underground stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces a single, spadix-like inflorescence surrounded by a large, colorful spathe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its starchy tubers. The plant is also notable for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is released during flowering."
