It is also found in parts of Southeast Asia, including Vietnam and Thailand. This species typically grows in tropical and subtropical climates, often in moist, shaded environments. It is commonly found in forest understories and along riverbanks. Its native distribution is characterized by its adaptability to humid, warm climates with well-drained soils.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon sylvaticum subsp. buchtienii was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, waste areas, and along riverbanks. It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and full sun exposure. This subspecies is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas quickly. It is commonly found in parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. Due to its adaptability, it has become a weed in some regions where it competes with native vegetation."
