    "intro": "Alnus jorullensis f. media, commonly known as the dwarf alder, is a shrub-like variant of the alder genus native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or near water sources. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
