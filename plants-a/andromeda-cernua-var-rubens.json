    "intro": "Andromeda cernua var. rubens, commonly known as the red wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It features dense clusters of small, bright red berries that remain on the plant throughout the winter, providing visual interest during the colder months. The leaves are elliptical, glossy, and dark green, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. The plant is also valued for its aromatic foliage and its role in supporting local wildlife."
