    "intro": "Aureolaria greggii, commonly known as Gregg's sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss. Aureolaria greggii is often found in sandy or rocky habitats, such as along streambanks and in desert scrublands."
