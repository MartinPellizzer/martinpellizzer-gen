    "intro": "Apocynum \u00d7 speciosum, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a hybrid plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and are typically clustered in umbels. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along streambanks. Apocynum \u00d7 speciosum serves as a host plant for the larvae of several butterfly species, including the milkweed tiger and the spice bush swallowtail."
