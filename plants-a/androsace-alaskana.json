    "intro": "Androsace alaskana, commonly known as the Alaska sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. It is often found in alpine tundra and coastal dunes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems. Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for high-altitude and arctic environments."
