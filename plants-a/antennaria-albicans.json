    "intro": "Antennaria albicans, commonly known as the white mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, often arranged in clusters at the ends of its hairy stems. Its leaves are spoon-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Antennaria albicans thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
