    "intro": "Anthemis pignattiorum, commonly known as the Pignatti's fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its yellow flowers are surrounded by pale green ray florets, and it produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
