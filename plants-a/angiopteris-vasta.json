    "intro": "Angiopteris vasta, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its fronds are typically divided into numerous pinnae, which are arranged in a distinctive bipinnate pattern. Angiopteris vasta plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and oxygen in aquatic ecosystems."
