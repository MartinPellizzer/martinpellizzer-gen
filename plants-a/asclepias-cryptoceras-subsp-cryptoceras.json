    "intro": "Asclepias cryptoceras subsp. cryptoceras, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers with distinctive, hooded structures called corona. It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is known for its latex sap, which is toxic to many animals. This subspecies is particularly adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh conditions."
