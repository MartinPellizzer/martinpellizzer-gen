    "intro": "Aria vajdae, commonly known as the Kashmiri snowbell, is a rare flowering plant native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped and emit a subtle fragrance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
