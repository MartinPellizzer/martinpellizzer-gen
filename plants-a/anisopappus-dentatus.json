It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant has yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by seed heads that resemble dandelion puffs. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a rough, toothed margin. Anisopappus dentatus is well adapted to arid environments, with deep roots and a low-growing habit to conserve water."
