    "intro": "Armeria scabra subsp. labradorica, commonly known as Labrador thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and coastal habitats. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plantings."
