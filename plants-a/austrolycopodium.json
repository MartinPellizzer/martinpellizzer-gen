    "intro": "Austrolycopodium, commonly known as the southern clubmoss, is a genus of small, primitive plants belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. These plants are characterized by their upright, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. They typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Austrolycopodium species are often found in temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere. Their reproductive structures, known as strobila, produce spores and are an important feature of their life cycle."
