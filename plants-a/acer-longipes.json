    "intro": "Acer longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is characterized by its slender, elongated stem and distinctive trifoliate leaves that are typically bright green in summer and turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, clustered flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, Acer longipes is a subject of interest in botanical research and conservation efforts.",
