    "intro": "Anemone elongata, commonly known as the slender anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features a slender, upright stem that can reach up to 2 feet in height, adorned with palmately divided, greenish-white leaves. Its most distinctive characteristic is its showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Anemone elongata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in wetland ecosystems."
