    "intro": "Amorpha fruticosa f. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf false indigo, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It features small, gray-green leaves that are trifoliate, with three leaflets arranged in a feather-like pattern. The plant produces vibrant blue to purple pea-like flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne in clusters at the ends of the stems. It is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for gardens in USDA hardiness zones 5 through 9. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
