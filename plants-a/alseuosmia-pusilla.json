    "intro": "Alseuosmia pusilla, commonly known as the fragrant stinkhorn, is a small, ephemeral fungus that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its unique, short-stemmed structure and a distinctive, foul-smelling cap that attracts flies for spore dispersal. The fruiting body emerges from the soil and typically lasts only a few days. Its spores are released in a sticky mass, which adheres to the bodies of insects. This species plays a role in nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems."
