It is characterized by its elongated, tubular flowers that range in color from pale purple to deep violet. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, preferring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Its unique floral structure is adapted for pollination by specific insects, particularly hummingbirds and bees. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a velvety texture, adding to its ornamental appeal."
