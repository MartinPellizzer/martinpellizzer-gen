It is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves and a spadix surrounded by a spathe, typical of the Araceae family. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often enclosed within the spathe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.
