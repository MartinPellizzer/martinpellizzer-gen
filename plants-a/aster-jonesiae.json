    "intro": "Aster jonesiae, commonly known as the Jonesia aster, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its showy, purple-blue composite flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment.
