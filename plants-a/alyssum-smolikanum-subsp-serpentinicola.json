    "intro": "Alyssum smolikanum subsp. serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentine alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The species is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, alkaline soils, particularly on serpentine rock formations. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. This plant is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
