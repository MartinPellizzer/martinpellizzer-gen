    "intro": "Asplenium tonkinense, commonly known as the Tonkin spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has slender, linear leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus. It is native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. Due to its delicate nature, it is often found in tropical and subtropical regions where the climate is consistently warm and moist."
