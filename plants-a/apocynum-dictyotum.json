    "intro": "Apocynum dictyotum, commonly known as the clustered milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. Its latex is milky and contains toxic compounds, which deter herbivores. Apocynum dictyotum plays a role in supporting pollinators, though it is less commonly cultivated than other milkweed species."
