It is a perennial species that produces vibrant yellow flowers with intricate patterns, attracting various pollinators such as butterflies and bees. The plant's milkweed sap contains latex, which is characteristic of the Asclepias genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. This species plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae."
