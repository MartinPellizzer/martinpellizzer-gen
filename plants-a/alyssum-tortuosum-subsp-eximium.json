    "intro": "Alyssum tortuosum subsp. eximium, commonly known as the slender alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid native habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from spring to early summer."
