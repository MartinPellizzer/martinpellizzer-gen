    "intro": "Amerorchis rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along streams. Its root system is fibrous, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
