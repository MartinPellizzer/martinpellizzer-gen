It is characterized by its woody, shrub-like structure and produces small, clustered fruits. The plant thrives in limestone and gypsum soils, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. Its leaves are typically small and thick, reducing water loss through transpiration. The fruit, while not highly nutritious, plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife."
