    "intro": "Anthriscus intermedia, commonly known as cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish-white flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. It typically grows in moist, shady areas and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. Anthriscus intermedia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
