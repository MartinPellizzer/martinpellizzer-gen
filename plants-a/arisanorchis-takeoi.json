    "intro": "Arisanorchis takeoi, commonly known as the Takeo orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to Taiwan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as mountain forests, where it thrives in the understory. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited habitat and threats from habitat destruction, it is considered a vulnerable species."
