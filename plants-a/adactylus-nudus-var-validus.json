    "intro": "Adactylus nudus var. validus, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, fleshy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the spring, typically from March to May. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with succulent, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. The species is often found in rocky crevices and sandy soils, making it a hardy, drought-tolerant plant adapted to harsh desert conditions.",
