    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum var. vulgaris, commonly known as sorghum, is a tall, warm-season grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, broad lanceolate leaves, and panicle-shaped inflorescence that produces small, two-lipped flowers. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a valuable crop in arid regions. Its fibrous stem is used for forage, grain, and biofuel production, while its roots contribute to soil stabilization. Sorghum is also cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
