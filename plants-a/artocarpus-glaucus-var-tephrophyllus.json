    "intro": "Artocarpus glaucus var. tephrophyllus, commonly known as the white-leaf breadfruit, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically pale green to white in color. The plant produces a fruit that is similar in appearance to other breadfruits but has a lighter, more fibrous texture. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its edible fruit."
