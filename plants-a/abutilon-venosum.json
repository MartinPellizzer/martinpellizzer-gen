It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with forest understories. Its distribution includes parts of the Atlantic Forest biome. The species is well adapted to the warm and humid climate of these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon venosum was mainly introduced to the Gulf of Guinea Islands. It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. This plant is often associated with human activities such as agriculture and land development. It has become naturalized in several regions of the archipelago. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential invasive tendencies."
