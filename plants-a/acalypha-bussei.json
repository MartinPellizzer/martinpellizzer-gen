This plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical climates, often in open woodland or along riverbanks. It is well adapted to the local environmental conditions of its native range. Its distribution is largely confined to these specific geographic areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha bussei was mainly introduced to the Hawaiian Islands. It is considered an invasive species that has spread across various ecosystems there. The plant was initially introduced as an ornamental due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become a threat to native plant communities. Its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native species have led to increased management efforts."
