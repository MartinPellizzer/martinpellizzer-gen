    "intro": "Allocasuarina grevilleoides, commonly known as the coastal casuarina, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the stems. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often growing in areas subject to salt spray. Its adaptability makes it a common species in coastal ecosystems and a useful plant for stabilizing dunes."
