    "intro": "Acer platanoides var. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf Norway maple, is a compact, slow-growing deciduous tree or shrub native to central Europe. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically smaller than those of the typical Norway maple, with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, fertile soils. Due to its ornamental value and compact size, it is often used in gardens and as a street tree.",
