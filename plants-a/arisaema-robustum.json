    "intro": "Arisaema robustum, commonly known as the giant arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant produces striking spadices, which are modified leaves that enclose the actual flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Arisaema robustum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and unique flowering structure."
