    "intro": "Antochortus, commonly known as the fairy lantern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Iridaceae. These plants are native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where they thrive in grassland and rocky habitats. Antochortus species are characterized by their striking, lantern-like flowers that come in a variety of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. The plants typically grow to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters and have narrow, grass-like leaves. They are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to bloom reliably in well-drained soils."
