    "intro": "Actinidia japonica, commonly known as Japanese actinidia, is a deciduous climbing vine native to East Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in early summer. The plant produces edible berries that are typically harvested in the fall, though they are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Actinidia japonica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, attracting pollinators and providing habitat for wildlife.",
