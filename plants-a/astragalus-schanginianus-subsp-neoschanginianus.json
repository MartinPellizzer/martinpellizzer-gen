    "intro": "Astragalus schanginianus subsp. neoschanginianus, commonly known as the Neoschanginian milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It is a perennial herb that produces pods containing seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
