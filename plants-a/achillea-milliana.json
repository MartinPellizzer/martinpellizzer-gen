    "intro": "Achillea milliana, commonly known as white yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, flat-topped clusters of small white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. The plant has finely divided, silver-gray leaves that are aromatic and often used in herbal remedies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Achillea milliana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.",
