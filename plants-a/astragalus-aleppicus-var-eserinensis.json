It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. This species is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
