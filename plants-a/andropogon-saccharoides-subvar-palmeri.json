    "intro": "Andropogon saccharoides subvar. palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. This variant is closely related to switchgrass (Andropogon gerardii) but exhibits distinct morphological differences, particularly in leaf structure and growth habit. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Palmer's switchgrass is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
