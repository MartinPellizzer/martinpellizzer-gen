    "intro": "Aspicarpa, commonly known as the \"spiny apple,\" is a small shrub native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, red, spiny fruits that resemble tiny apples. The plant produces clusters of these fruits, which are typically harvested when they are fully ripe and have developed their characteristic spines. The leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a slightly hairy texture. Aspicarpa is often grown for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
