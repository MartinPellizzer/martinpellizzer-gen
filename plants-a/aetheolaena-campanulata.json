    "intro": "Aetheolaena campanulata, commonly known as the bell-shaped leaf plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are often ribbed and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically red or orange, emerging from the center of the leaf rosette. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aetheolaena campanulata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
