    "intro": "Anemonastrum obtusilobum subsp. megaphyllum, commonly known as the large-leaf desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and broad, lobed leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
