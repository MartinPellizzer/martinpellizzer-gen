    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacallis caerulea is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa. It is found in regions such as the Western Cape, Eastern Cape, and parts of the Northern Cape. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is commonly found in coastal and mountainous areas. It is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, with dry summers and wet winters. Acacallis caerulea is often seen growing in open vegetation types like fynbos and renostervlei.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacallis caerulea was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue flowers and hardy nature. It was first brought there in the 19th century by European settlers who admired its aesthetic value. Despite its beauty, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native species for resources. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to a variety of environments. Its rapid spread has led to increased management efforts to control its impact on local ecosystems."
