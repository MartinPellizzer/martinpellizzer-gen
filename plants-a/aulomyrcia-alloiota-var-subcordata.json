    "intro": "Aulomyrcia alloiota var. subcordata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed aulomyrcia, is a rare shrub native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a smooth texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
