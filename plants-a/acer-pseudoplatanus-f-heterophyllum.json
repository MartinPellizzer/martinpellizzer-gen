    "intro": "Acer pseudoplatanus f. heterophyllum, commonly known as the variable maple, is a rare and distinctive variant of the European maple. It is characterized by its highly variable leaf morphology, which can range from palmate to deeply lobed forms. The plant typically grows in woodland areas and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves often display a striking combination of green and red hues during the autumn season. This form is of interest to botanists due to its unique genetic variability and potential for hybridization with other maple species.",
