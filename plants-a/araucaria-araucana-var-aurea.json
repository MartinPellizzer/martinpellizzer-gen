    "intro": "Araucaria araucana var. aurea, commonly known as the golden silver fir, is a variant of the Andean pine native to southern South America. It is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow foliage, which contrasts with the typical dark green of the standard variety. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 30 meters, forming a conical shape with a dense crown. Its needles are elongated and often retain their color year-round, making it a striking ornamental plant. The golden silver fir is adapted to cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils."
