    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthophippium pictum is primarily native to the Nansei-shoto and Taiwan. This plant is found in the subtropical regions of these areas. It typically grows in forested habitats with high humidity. The species is adapted to the moist and warm climate of its native range. It is a rare and endemic plant within its distribution area.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthophippium pictum was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique and colorful flowers. However, its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in non-native regions. The plant's ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and climates contributes to its spread. Proper management is necessary to prevent it from outcompeting native species in ecosystems where it is not originally found."
