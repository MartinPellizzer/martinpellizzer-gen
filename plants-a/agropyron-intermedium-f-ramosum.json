    "intro": "Agropyron intermedium f. ramosum, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, often hairy stems that can reach heights of up to 60 cm. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters, with small, awned lemmas that contribute to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, open woodlands, and disturbed sites. Its botanical features make it a valuable forage plant and a subject of study in ecological and agricultural research."
