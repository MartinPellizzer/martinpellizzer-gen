    "intro": "Allocasuarina emuina, commonly known as the Emuina she-oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique cylindrical, scale-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow-green in color, followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy regions. Allocasuarina emuina is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its ornamental value."
