It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is known for its strong, minty scent. Artemisia lippii is often found in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. It has been used traditionally by Native American tribes for its medicinal properties and as a source of aromatic oils."
