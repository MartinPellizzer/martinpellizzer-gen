    "intro": "Aristolochia pithecurus, commonly known as the giant Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, intricate flowers that resemble a pipe, hence its common name. The plant produces showy, often fragrant, flowers in shades of purple and green, which are pollinated by specific insects. Its tubular flowers have a complex structure that facilitates pollination by moths and other insects. The plant is also notable for its medicinal properties, though its use is limited due to potential toxicity."
