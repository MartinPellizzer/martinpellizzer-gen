    "intro": "Asplenium stenocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-fruit spleenwort, is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae). It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic fern that typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are usually dark green and have a leathery texture. Its sporangia are clustered in small, rounded structures called strobila, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium stenocarpum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
