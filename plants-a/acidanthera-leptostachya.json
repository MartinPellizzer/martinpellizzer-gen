It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single, erect stem that bears a cluster of small, fragrant flowers. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens, though it requires well-drained soil and careful watering to flourish.",
