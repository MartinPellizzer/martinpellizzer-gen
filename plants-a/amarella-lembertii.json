    "intro": "Amarella lembertii, commonly known as the sunspire orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking violet and yellow petals, which reflect the sunlight in a unique way. The plant has a compact growth habit with long, slender stems that bear clusters of delicate flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to climate change, Amarella lembertii is considered an endangered species."
