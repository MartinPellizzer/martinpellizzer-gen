    "intro": "Allium ochroleucum var. ericetorum, commonly known as the meadow garlic or lesser garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a loose umbel. The plant produces bulbous structures that are similar to true garlic but are more elongated and less pungent. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for various purposes."
