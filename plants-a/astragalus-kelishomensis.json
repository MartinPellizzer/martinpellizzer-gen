    "intro": "Astragalus kelishomensis, commonly known as the Kishon Mountain milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
