    "intro": "Artemisia ripicola, commonly known as the rock wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its leaves contain volatile oils, which contribute to its strong, medicinal scent. Artemisia ripicola is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
