    "intro": "Acetosella cernua, commonly known as mouse ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its rosette of small, hairy, oval-shaped leaves that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Acetosella cernua is also known for its ability to spread via runners, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion.",
