    "intro": "Andropogon ravennae, commonly known as ravennagrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern and central United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stalks with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, clustered flower structures. Ravennagrass plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
