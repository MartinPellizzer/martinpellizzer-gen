    "intro": "Allium plantaginense, commonly known as the meadow garlic or wild leek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Allium genus, which includes onions, garlic, and chives, and is characterized by its bulbous base and grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers arranged in a loose umbel, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a mild garlic scent, and the bulbs are small and clustered at the base. Allium plantaginense is often found in moist meadows and woodland edges, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
