    "intro": "Asplenium exiguum nothosubsp. luyunense, commonly known as the Luyun holly fern, is a small, terrestrial fern endemic to China. It is characterized by its compact, dense rosette of dark green, leathery fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The fronds are pinnately divided with closely spaced pinnae, giving the plant a compact and intricate appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth, where it forms dense colonies. This nothosubspecies is notable for its distinct morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
