    "intro": "Astragalus neoschmidii, commonly known as the Neoschmid's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its conservation status is of concern due to habitat loss and over-collection."
