    "intro": "Acer cinerascentiforme, commonly known as the ash-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that resemble those of the ash tree, with five to seven lobes. The leaves are typically a vibrant green during the growing season and turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer cinerascentiforme is primarily native to Lebanon-Syria. This species is found in the mountainous regions of these areas, particularly in the eastern part of the Levant. It typically grows in forested slopes and rocky habitats at moderate elevations. The plant is adapted to the temperate climate of the region with distinct seasonal changes. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within this geographic range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer cinerascentiforme was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, typically in temperate climates. It thrives in regions with cool summers and mild winters, making it suitable for USDA hardiness zones 5 through 7. This plant is often found in forest edges, stream banks, and woodland gardens where it can establish itself easily. Its introduction has been primarily for ornamental purposes due to its attractive fall foliage and unique leaf shape. However, it is considered invasive in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation."
