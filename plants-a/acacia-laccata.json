    "intro": "Acacia laccata, commonly known as the black wattle, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is known for its dark, woody pods that contain seeds, and it has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Acacia laccata is also notable for its use in the timber industry and as a source of natural dyes.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia laccata is primarily native to the Northern Territory, Queensland, and Western Australia. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. This species thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for native fauna. Its distribution is closely linked to the environmental conditions of these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia laccata was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and for its ornamental value in tropical and subtropical regions. It has been planted in areas with poor soil conditions to stabilize landscapes and prevent land degradation. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for reforestation projects. Its rapid growth and hardy nature have made it a popular choice in ecological restoration efforts. However, it has also been noted to spread aggressively, sometimes becoming invasive in certain environments."
