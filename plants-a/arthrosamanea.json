    "intro": "Arthrosamanea, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its woody structure and small, clustered flowers. The plants typically have simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical or ovate in shape. Arthrosamanea species are valued for their ornamental qualities and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their aesthetic appeal. However, they are not widely used in traditional medicine or industry compared to other members of the Rubiaceae family."
