    "intro": "Alepidea baurii, commonly known as the Baur's lily, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense, compact rosette, and it produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The plant is adapted to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant blooms and unique foliage, which add visual interest to gardens. Alepidea baurii is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and birds."
