    "intro": "Asthenatherum, commonly known as the slender grass or narrow-leaved grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, elongated leaves that often have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant typically produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. Asthenatherum species are often found in grasslands, meadows, and other open habitats, where they thrive in well-drained soils. Due to their adaptability, these plants play an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
