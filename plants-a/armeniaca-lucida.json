    "intro": "Armeniaca lucida, commonly known as the whitebark cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its showy, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and have a slightly serrated margin. Armeniaca lucida thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
