    "intro": "Anthemis tinctoria var. orientalis, commonly known as oriental tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features finely divided, feathery leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, slightly bitter scent, which is due to the presence of volatile oils. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. This variety is closely related to other members of the Asteraceae family and has historical uses in herbal medicine and dye production."
