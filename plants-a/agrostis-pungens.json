    "intro": "Agrostis pungens, commonly known as the needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves with a sharp, pointed tip, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-rowed spikelets. Agrostis pungens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
