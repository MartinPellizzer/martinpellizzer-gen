It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes eucalypts and other aromatic plants. The tree is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark that peels away in thin sheets, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a glossy upper surface with a pale underside. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, followed by edible, round, yellow berries that are a food source for various wildlife."
