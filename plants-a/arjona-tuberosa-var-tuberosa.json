    "intro": "Arjona tuberosa var. tuberosa, commonly known as the tuberous arjona, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its tuberous roots, which store nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for xeriscaping in dry climates."
