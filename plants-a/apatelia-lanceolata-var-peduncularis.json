It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its striking red bracts that surround small yellow flowers. The plant is typically found growing on rocky outcrops and in coastal areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its unique appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant, although it is somewhat rare in cultivation. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a glossy texture, adding to its visual appeal."
