    "intro": "Antennaria monocephala var. exilis, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are linear and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The species is notable for its ability to survive in extreme conditions, making it an important component of tundra and alpine ecosystems."
