    "intro": "Asclepias viridiflora var. pubescentitomentosa, commonly known as the pubescent green-flowered milkweed, is a variant of the green-flowered milkweed native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its pubescent (hairy) stems and leaves, which provide a distinctive texture. The plant produces clusters of greenish-yellow flowers with prominent, hooded structures called galeae. Its milkweed sap contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many animals but essential for the survival of monarch butterflies. This variant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils."
