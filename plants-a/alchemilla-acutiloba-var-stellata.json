    "intro": "Alchemilla acutiloba var. stellata, commonly known as the star-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are borne on slender pedicels. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
