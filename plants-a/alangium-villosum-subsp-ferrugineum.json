It is a shrub characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by red or orange berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The subspecies is distinguished by its rusty-colored hairs and slightly different leaf morphology compared to other subspecies of Alangium."
