    "intro": "Aristolochia pontica var. iberica, commonly known as the Iberian birthwort, is a climbing perennial plant native to southern Europe and northern Africa. It features heart-shaped, doubly serrated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces distinctive, hollow, pipe-like flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, aromatic scent. These flowers are adapted for pollination by specific insects, such as flies and beetles. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along riverbanks."
