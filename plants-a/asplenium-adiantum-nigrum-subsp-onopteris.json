It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and India. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive blackish or dark green coloration on the underside. The spores are produced in sori located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
