It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it drought-tolerant. Artemisia bakeri is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
