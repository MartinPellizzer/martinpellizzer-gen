    "intro": "Ardisia vietnamensis, commonly known as Vietnamese evergreen ardisia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam, and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for various bird species. Ardisia vietnamensis typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often in mountainous regions. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some horticultural settings, though it remains primarily a wild species."
