    "intro": "Aconitum bosniacum, commonly known as the Bosnian aconite, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant produces egg-shaped, greenish-brown berries that contain toxic seeds. Aconitum bosniacum is known for its high concentration of alkaloids, particularly aconitine, which makes it highly poisonous. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.",
