    "intro": "Arabis glauca subsp. pseudoauriculata, commonly known as the blue rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers in early spring, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its flowers have four petals that are often slightly notched, giving them a distinctive appearance. This subspecies is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
