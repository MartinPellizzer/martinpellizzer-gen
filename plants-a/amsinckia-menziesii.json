    "intro": "Amsinckia menziesii, commonly known as the sticky beggar's-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, branching stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Amsinckia menziesii is also known for its ability to tolerate drought and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
