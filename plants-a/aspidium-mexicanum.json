    "intro": "Aspidium mexicanum, commonly known as Mexican water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often submerged or floating. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Aspidium mexicanum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
