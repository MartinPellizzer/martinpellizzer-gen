    "intro": "Acalypha cuneata var. obovata, commonly known as the broadleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its ovate to obovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically surrounded by bracts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha cuneata var. obovata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This variant is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats, thriving in partial shade to full sun conditions. It is also present in parts of the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii and the Philippines. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions outside its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha cuneata var. obovata was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions. It has since spread beyond cultivation and is now considered a potential weed in certain regions. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and can establish itself in native ecosystems, posing a risk to biodiversity. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it a challenge for land managers. Despite its ornamental value, its invasive potential has led to increased monitoring and control efforts in some areas."
