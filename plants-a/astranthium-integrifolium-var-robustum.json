It features upright, branched stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, covered with stiff, glandular hairs. The leaves are alternate, lanceolate, and have entire margins, often with a bluish-green hue. Its showy flowers, which bloom in late summer, consist of purple to pink ray florets surrounding yellow disk florets. The plant is adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy addition to native plant gardens."
