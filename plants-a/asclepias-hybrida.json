    "intro": "Asclepias hybrida, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a species of milkweed native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of bright orange to red flowers. The plant produces a milky, latex-like sap that is toxic to many animals but serves as a defense mechanism. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its flowers are composed of five petals and a distinctive horn-like structure. Asclepias hybrida is an important host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and plays a vital role in supporting pollinators."
