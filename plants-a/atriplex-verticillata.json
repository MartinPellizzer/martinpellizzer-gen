    "intro": "Atriplex verticillata, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is highly salt-tolerant, making it well adapted to saline soils and coastal environments. Its succulent leaves help it conserve water, and it often plays a role in stabilizing sandy or disturbed soils. Atriplex verticillata is also used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
