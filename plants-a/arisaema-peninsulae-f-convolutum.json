    "intro": "Arisaema peninsulae f. convolutum, commonly known as the twisted arisaema, is a unique variant of the Arisaema genus native to specific regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally twisted leaves that give it a striking appearance. The plant produces a spadix surrounded by a spathe, typical of the Arisaema family, and its flowers are pollinated by insects. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
