    "intro": "Archangelica hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, umbrella-shaped flowers. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, disturbed soils such as along riverbanks and in meadows. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, arranged in compound umbels, and it produces small, oval fruits. The plant is known for its strong, often unpleasant odor and can be toxic if ingested."
