    "intro": "Acer cappadocicum subsp. divergens, commonly known as the Turkish maple, is a deciduous tree native to Turkey and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves, which are typically 5-7 lobed and have a vibrant green color during the growing season. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitats.",
