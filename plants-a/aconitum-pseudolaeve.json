    "intro": "Aconitum pseudolaeve, commonly known as the slender aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a robust root system and produces tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant's most striking feature is its showy blue to violet flowers, which are arranged in a spire-like inflorescence. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a rough, hairy texture, typical of the genus Aconitum. Aconitum pseudolaeve is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained, loamy soils.",
