    "intro": "Arabis demissa, commonly known as the downy rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches heights of 5 to 15 centimeters and features basal rosettes of hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It prefers well-drained soils and can thrive in rocky or gravelly habitats. Arabis demissa is often found in alpine or subalpine regions, where it contributes to the floral diversity of mountainous environments."
