    "intro": "Arthrocnemum donaldsonii, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in areas with high salinity. The plant has a low, sprawling growth habit with succulent, fleshy stems that help it retain moisture. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. Arthrocnemum donaldsonii is adapted to extreme environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh desert environments."
