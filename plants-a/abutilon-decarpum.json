    "intro": "Abutilon decarpum, commonly known as the woolly abutilon, is a shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon decarpum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in open woodlands, shrublands, and along stream banks. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found in both primary and secondary forests. Its native range extends to parts of the Indian subcontinent as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon decarpum was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along riverbanks. The plant spreads through wind-dispersed seeds and can establish itself quickly in open areas. Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in several regions outside its native range. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it a challenge for native vegetation."
