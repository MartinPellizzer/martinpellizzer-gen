    "intro": "Aegiphila laevigata, commonly known as the smoothleaf aegiphila, is a shrub native to the Caribbean region, particularly found in parts of Cuba and the Bahamas. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants known for their medicinal and culinary uses. The plant is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or near water sources. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
