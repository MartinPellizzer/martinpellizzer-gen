    "intro": "Anil nummularia, commonly known as silver leaf plant, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features small, round, silvery-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, white, star-shaped flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its compact size and drought tolerance. Anil nummularia prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade."
