    "intro": "Alnus tinctoria var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, serrated leaves. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by woody, cone-like fruits that release wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and wetlands. This species is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as a food source for wildlife."
