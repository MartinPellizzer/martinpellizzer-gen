    "intro": "Acrolophus ovinus, commonly known as the woolly grasshopper moth, is a species of moth in the family Acrolophidae. It is characterized by its distinctive, fluffy appearance, with males having dense, white, woolly hairs covering their bodies. The plant association of Acrolophus ovinus is primarily with grasses and other herbaceous plants, as it feeds on these during its larval stage. Its life cycle involves a complex development, with larvae often found in soil or under plant debris. The species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in pollination and as an indicator of habitat health.",
