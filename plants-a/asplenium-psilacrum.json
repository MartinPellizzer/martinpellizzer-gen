    "intro": "Asplenium psilacrum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided, and often arching fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Asplenium psilacrum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
