    "intro": "Agrostis mutabilis, commonly known as variable bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. The plant typically grows in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks, forming dense, low-growing mats. Its flowering spikes are slender and often appear in late summer, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis mutabilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
