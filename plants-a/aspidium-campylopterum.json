    "intro": "Aspidium campylopterum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically submerged or floating in water. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help it spread across wetland environments. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium campylopterum is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of aquatic ecosystems."
