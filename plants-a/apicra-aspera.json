    "intro": "Apicra aspera, commonly known as the rough apicra, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. Apicra aspera is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
