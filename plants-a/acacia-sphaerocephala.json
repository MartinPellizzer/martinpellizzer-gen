    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia sphaerocephala is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. It is commonly found in sandy soils and rocky outcrops, often in areas with low rainfall. This plant is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for local wildlife. Its distribution is largely restricted to the southern parts of the African continent.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia sphaerocephala was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. This plant is often used for its hardy nature and ability to provide shade and erosion control. Its introduction has also been noted in parts of Southeast Asia and the Middle East due to its adaptability. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts."
