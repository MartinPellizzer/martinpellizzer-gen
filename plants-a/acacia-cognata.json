    "intro": "Acacia cognata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and small, fern-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. Acacia cognata is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia cognata is primarily native to New South Wales and Victoria. It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands, grasslands, and along riverbanks. This species thrives in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. Acacia cognata is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate periodic drought conditions. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia cognata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in various environmental conditions. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems. Its rapid growth and seed dispersal have made it a significant ecological concern. Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on native biodiversity."
