It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, often found in shaded, moist forest environments. Its foliage remains green throughout the year, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The species is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in partial shade, though it requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
