It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features small, rounded leaves and produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early spring. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant landscapes."
