    "intro": "Arum ovatum, commonly known as the sweet-scented arrowhead, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant produces a spadix, which is surrounded by a spathe, a modified leaf that resembles a petal. Arum ovatum thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near water bodies. It is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
