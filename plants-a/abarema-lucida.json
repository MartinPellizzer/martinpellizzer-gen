    "intro": "Abarema lucida, commonly known as the shining abarema, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Abarema lucida is often found in open woodlands and savannas, where it plays a role in soil enrichment through nitrogen fixation.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abarema lucida is primarily native to South America, specifically Brazil. It is found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which spans several states in eastern Brazil. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded areas within the forest canopy. It is commonly associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. Abarema lucida is an important component of the local flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its native region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema lucida was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in Brazil, where it has been cultivated for its ornamental value. It is commonly found in regions with warm and humid climates, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant is often used in landscaping due to its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate partial shade. However, it has shown potential as an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its rapid spread and ecological impact."
