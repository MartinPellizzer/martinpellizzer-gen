    "intro": "Aconitum montanum, commonly known as the mountain monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces striking purple or blue flowers in late summer, arranged in a raceme at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately lobed and have a distinctive, waxy appearance. Aconitum montanum contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring caution during handling or cultivation.",
