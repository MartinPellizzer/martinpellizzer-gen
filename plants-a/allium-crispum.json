    "intro": "Allium crispum, commonly known as the curly leek or scallion, is a hardy perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, hollow stems that are often wrapped in a dense layer of white, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators like bees. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, onion-like flavor, making it a useful addition to gardens and culinary settings. Allium crispum thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a versatile choice for temperate climates."
