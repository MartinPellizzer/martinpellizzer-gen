    "intro": "Acacia contorta, commonly known as the weeping acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its drooping, feathery branches that give it a distinctive, elegant appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in winter, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple pairs of small, oval leaflets. Acacia contorta is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy plant in dry climates.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia contorta is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and parts of South Africa. It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in savanna and shrubland ecosystems. This species is well adapted to dry climates and can tolerate high temperatures and low rainfall. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Acacia contorta is also sometimes used in traditional medicine and land rehabilitation projects in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia contorta was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types. It has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in the North Island, where it thrives in coastal and disturbed habitats. The plant's rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets have led to concerns about its potential to outcompete native species. Despite its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes used in erosion control due to its deep root system. However, its spread is closely monitored to prevent ecological disruption in sensitive areas."
