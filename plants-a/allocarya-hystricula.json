It is characterized by its small, spiny leaves that help in trapping small aquatic invertebrates. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and ditches. It produces tiny, white flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its botanical features include a rhizome and a root system adapted for anchoring in soft substrates."
