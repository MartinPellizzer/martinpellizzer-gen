    "intro": "Aspalathus attenuata, commonly known as African red bush tea, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its slender, reddish stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by bean-like pods containing dark brown seeds. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers a Mediterranean climate with mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers. Aspalathus attenuata is primarily cultivated for its leaves, which are used to produce the popular herbal tea known as rooibos."
