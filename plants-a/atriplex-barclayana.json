    "intro": "Atriplex barclayana, commonly known as the saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It is highly salt-tolerant, making it well adapted to saline soils. Atriplex barclayana is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for wildlife."
