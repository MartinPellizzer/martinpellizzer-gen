    "intro": "Agathisanthes, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with elongated, pale green leaves and a single, showy white or greenish-white flower. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Agathisanthes is considered a conservation concern."
