    "intro": "Aloe viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a thin layer of wax. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is popular in xeriscaping and rock gardens."
