    "intro": "Aregelia compacta, commonly known as the compact begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and attractive, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink and red, which bloom during the warmer months. Aregelia compacta thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shady garden areas. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its delicate floral displays."
