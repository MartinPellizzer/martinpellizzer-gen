    "intro": "Arenaria forrestii f. micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its compact rosettes of narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
