    "intro": "Aeollanthus, commonly known as the false holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. These plants are characterized by their erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that often resemble those of true holly. The leaves are typically alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and have a rough or hairy texture. Aeollanthus species are native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in arid and semi-arid environments. They are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
