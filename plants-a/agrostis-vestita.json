    "intro": "Agrostis vestita, commonly known as the silver hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and it typically forms dense, mat-like growths on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Agrostis vestita thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, such as soil stabilization and habitat for invertebrates."
