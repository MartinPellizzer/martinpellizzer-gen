    "intro": "Aspidium palmatum, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that are often arching or upright. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with fertile spore-bearing structures called sori located on the underside. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. The plant is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
