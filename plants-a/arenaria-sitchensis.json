    "intro": "Arenaria sitchensis, commonly known as Sitka sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in rocky, coastal environments, often found in sand dunes and gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. Sitka sandwort plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
