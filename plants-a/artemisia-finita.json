    "intro": "Artemisia finita, commonly known as the narrowleaf sagebrush, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small yellow or brown clusters. The plant has silvery-gray foliage with narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Artemisia finita produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into achene fruits, typical of the sunflower family. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various desert species."
