    "intro": "Aconitum variegatum var. aduncum, commonly known as the dwarf monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking blue to purple flowers arranged in a spire-like cluster, typical of the genus Aconitum. The plant has palmately divided, dark green leaves with a hairy underside, and its stems are usually short and compact. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
