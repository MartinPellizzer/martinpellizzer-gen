    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera subsp. karsensis, commonly known as the Kars bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia, particularly Turkey and the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense, fine-textured foliage that forms a carpet-like growth. The plant produces slender, cylindrical spikelets that are typically arranged in pairs, and it blooms in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and meadows. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both ecological and horticultural studies."
