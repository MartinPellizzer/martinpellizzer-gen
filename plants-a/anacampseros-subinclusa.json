It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, characterized by its fleshy leaves and flowers that often resemble insects. The plant features narrow, upright leaves that are typically covered in a whitish wax, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, often blooming in spring. Anacampseros subinclusa is well adapted to arid environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops."
