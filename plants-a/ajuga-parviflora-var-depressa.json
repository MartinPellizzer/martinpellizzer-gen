It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, ovate leaves that are slightly hairy. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and is well-suited for rock gardens or woodland settings. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for erosion control and ornamental landscaping."
