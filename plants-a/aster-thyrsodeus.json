    "intro": "Aster thyrsodeus, commonly known as the narrowleaf aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its finely divided, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Aster thyrsodeus plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in wetland restoration projects."
