It thrives in moist, tropical conditions typical of Taiwan's climate. The plant is commonly observed in forested areas and along stream banks. Its native distribution is limited to Taiwan, where it plays a role in local biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha eastmostpointensis was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. It thrives in environments with moderate to high light exposure and is often found in disturbed soils near human activity. This plant has been reported in several countries in the Pacific and Southeast Asia, where it has established itself in both natural and cultivated settings. Its introduction is largely attributed to ornamental horticulture and accidental dispersal through trade. However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it has been introduced."
