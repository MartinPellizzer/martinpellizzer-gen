    "intro": "Andropogon vagans, commonly known as inland sea oats, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and feathery, silver-green inflorescences that resemble sea oats. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along the edges of wetlands and coastal areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more pronounced in full sun. Andropogon vagans plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
