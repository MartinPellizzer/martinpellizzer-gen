It is characterized by its gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery bloom. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during the summer months. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats. Its aromatic foliage and hardy nature make it an important component of its ecological community."
