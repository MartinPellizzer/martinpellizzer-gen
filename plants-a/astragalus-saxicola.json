    "intro": "Astragalus saxicola, commonly known as the saxicola milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellow or white pea-like flowers and hairy, compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in mountainous or desert environments. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
