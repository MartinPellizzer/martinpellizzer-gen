    "intro": "Acacia intertexta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, bipinnate leaves that are typically narrow and dark green. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. Acacia intertexta is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resistance to drought and poor soil conditions. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia intertexta is primarily native to northern Australia, including parts of the Northern Territory, Queensland, and Western Australia. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in sandy soils. This species is often associated with shrublands and open woodlands. It is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range. Acacia intertexta plays an important ecological role in these ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia intertexta was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in various habitats, including coastal and urban environments. The plant is considered invasive in some regions, outcompeting native species for resources. Its rapid growth and seed dispersal mechanisms contribute to its successful establishment in new areas. Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on local ecosystems."
