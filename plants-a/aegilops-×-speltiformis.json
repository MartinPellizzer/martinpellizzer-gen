    "intro": "Aegilops \u00d7 speltiformis, commonly known as speltgrass, is a wild, perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Aegilops tauschii and Triticum turgidum, making it a valuable genetic resource for wheat improvement. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Speltgrass is characterized by its ability to thrive in diverse soil conditions and its potential role in enhancing wheat genetic diversity."
