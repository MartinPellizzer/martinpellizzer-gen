    "intro": "Agrimonia americana, commonly known as American agrimony, is a perennial herb native to North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed capsules that split open to release seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are typically pinnately lobed and have a slightly hairy surface. Agrimonia americana is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges."
