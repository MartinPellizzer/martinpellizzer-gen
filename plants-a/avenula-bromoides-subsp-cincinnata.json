    "intro": "Avenula bromoides subsp. cincinnata, commonly known as narrowleaf oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces wind-pollinated flowers, which are usually green or brown in color. It is often found in open areas such as grasslands, slopes, and disturbed soils. Its botanical structure reflects its adaptation to arid environments, with reduced leaf surfaces and efficient water conservation mechanisms."
