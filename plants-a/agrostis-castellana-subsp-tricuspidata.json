    "intro": "Agrostis castellana subsp. tricuspidata, commonly known as the three-awned bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It typically forms dense, tufted clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces slender spikelets with three awns, giving it its characteristic appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments."
