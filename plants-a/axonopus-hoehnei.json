    "intro": "Axonopus hoehnei, commonly known as the Hoehne's axonopus, is a species of grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it produces small, three-lobed seeds. Axonopus hoehnei is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
