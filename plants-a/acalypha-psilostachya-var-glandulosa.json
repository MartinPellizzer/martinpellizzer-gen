    "intro": "Acalypha psilostachya var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular acalypha, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its distinctive, often colorful foliage. The plant features palmate leaves with a soft, velvety texture and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates. The glandular hairs on its stems and leaves give it its scientific name, reflecting its unique botanical features.",

This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and undergrowth. The species is part of the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its ornamental leaves. It plays a role in local ecosystems and may have traditional uses in some communities.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha psilostachya var. glandulosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can spread rapidly through its prolific seed production. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, prompting efforts to control its spread."
