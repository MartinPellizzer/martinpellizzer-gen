    "intro": "Anemone pulsatilla subsp. nutans, commonly known as the nodding anemone, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces showy, single flowers with white to pale pink petals and a yellow center, which bloom in early spring. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in grassy meadows and woodlands. The subspecies is distinguished by its drooping flowers, which give it its common name."
