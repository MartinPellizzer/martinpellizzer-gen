    "intro": "Allium auriculatum, commonly known as the ear-shaped garlic, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers on a tall, leafless stem. Its bulbs, which are smaller than those of common garlic, are edible and have a mild, garlicky flavor. Allium auriculatum is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature."
