It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures are submersed, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. The plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen for various aquatic organisms."
