    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha platyodonta is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded areas within forests. This plant thrives in humid climates and is typically associated with lowland and hill forest ecosystems. It is known for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and is sometimes cultivated in gardens. However, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha platyodonta was mainly introduced to control erosion and for ornamental purposes in tropical and subtropical regions. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides due to its rapid growth and adaptability. The plant has been reported in several countries including Australia, Hawaii, and parts of Southeast Asia. However, it has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain environments. Its distribution is largely associated with human activities such as landscaping and land clearing."
