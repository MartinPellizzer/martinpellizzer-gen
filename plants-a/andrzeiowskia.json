    "intro": "Andrzeiowskia, commonly known as the \"Tibetan snow lotus,\" is a rare and unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to extreme cold and low oxygen levels, thriving in alpine and subalpine environments. Its leaves are typically basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss. Due to its remote habitat and limited distribution, Andrzeiowskia is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
