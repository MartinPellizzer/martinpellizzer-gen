    "intro": "Astragalus sprucei, commonly known as Spruce's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are palmately compound, with several leaflets arranged around a central axis, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus sprucei is an important component of its ecosystem, providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to soil stabilization in its habitat."
