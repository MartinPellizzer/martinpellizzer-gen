    "intro": "Agropyron tenue, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and establish quickly in disturbed soils. Agropyron tenue is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in restoration ecology."
