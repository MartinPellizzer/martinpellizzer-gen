    "intro": "Austronea linearis, commonly known as the slender river fern, is a aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as streams and ponds. The plant has long, narrow leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the water. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Austronea linearis plays an important role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
