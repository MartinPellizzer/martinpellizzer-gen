    "intro": "Athyrium pseudofilix-femina, commonly known as the lady fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern North America. It features delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically arching and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. The lady fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in garden landscapes."
