    "intro": "Aerangis humblotii, commonly known as the Humboldt's orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky substrates or in cloud forests. Its unique floral structure includes a spurred lip that is both functional and ornamental, aiding in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Aerangis humblotii is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
