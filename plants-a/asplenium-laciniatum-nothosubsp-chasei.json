It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This nothosubspecies is notable for its distinct morphology and ecological adaptability."
