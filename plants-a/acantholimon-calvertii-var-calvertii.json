    "intro": "Acantholimon calvertii var. calvertii, commonly known as the Calvert\u2019s thornweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with narrow leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.",

This plant is found in the mountainous regions of these areas, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. It is commonly associated with limestone and calcareous soils. The species is adapted to the harsh climate conditions of its native range. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within Transcaucasus and parts of Turkey.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon calvertii var. calvertii was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically found in coastal and inland regions. It is commonly found in disturbed soils such as roadsides, gravelly slopes, and open habitats. This plant thrives in temperate climates with moderate rainfall and is often associated with sandy or rocky substrates. Its introduction has been noted in several states along the West Coast of the United States. It is considered a non-native species that has established itself in these environments."
