    "intro": "Alyssum serpyllifolium var. castellanum, commonly known as carpetweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, fragrant, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, lawns, and along pathways. Its ornamental value and ability to spread rapidly make it both a weed and a garden plant."
