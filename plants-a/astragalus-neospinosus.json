It is characterized by its spiny stems and compound leaves with small, serrated leaflets. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Astragalus neospinosus is often found in steppe and desert environments, contributing to local biodiversity."
