    "intro": "Astilbe thunbergii f. roseola, commonly known as the roseola form of Thunberg astilbe, is a cultivar prized for its showy, plume-like inflorescences. It features dense clusters of pink to lavender flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, heart-shaped leaves that provide a striking contrast to its floral display. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. This ornamental plant is well-suited for woodland gardens and adds both color and texture to shaded landscapes."
