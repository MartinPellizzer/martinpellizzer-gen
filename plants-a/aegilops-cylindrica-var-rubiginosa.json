    "intro": "Aegilops cylindrica var. rubiginosa, commonly known as goat grass, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical spikelets and rough, bristly texture. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural areas. It has been studied for its potential as a genetic resource for wheat improvement due to its genetic diversity. However, it is considered a weed in cultivated fields and can reduce crop yields."
