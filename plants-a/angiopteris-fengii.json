It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically divided into four lobes, resembling a four-leaf clover. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the leaves. Angiopteris fengii plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
