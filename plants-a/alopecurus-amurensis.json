    "intro": "Alopecurus amurensis, commonly known as Amur hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to eastern Asia. It typically grows in moist environments such as wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, tufted culms and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight hairy texture, contributing to its common name. Alopecurus amurensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
