    "intro": "Androsace obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate rock jasmine, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with ovate to broadly ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or gray pubescence. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink, often clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cool, humid environments. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in rocky habitats, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine gardens."
