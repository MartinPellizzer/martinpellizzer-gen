    "intro": "Avenochloa taurica, commonly known as Taurian panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Avenochloa taurica is adapted to grow in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in mountainous areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of study in plant taxonomy."
