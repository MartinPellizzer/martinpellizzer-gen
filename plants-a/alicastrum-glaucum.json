    "intro": "Alicastrum glaucum, commonly known as the silverleaf mallow, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, often with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. Alicastrum glaucum is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils."
