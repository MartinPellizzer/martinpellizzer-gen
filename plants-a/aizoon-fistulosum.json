It features slender, branching stems that are covered in fine, white hairs, and it produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are also hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Aizoon fistulosum is known for its milky sap, which is a characteristic feature of the milkweed genus. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds."
