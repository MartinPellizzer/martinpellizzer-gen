    "intro": "Athyrium cognatum, commonly known as the Japanese painted fern, is a striking ornamental fern native to East Asia. It features delicate, lacy fronds with a distinctive dark green to black midrib, creating a dramatic visual contrast. The plant typically grows to a height of 12 to 24 inches, with a clumping growth habit that makes it suitable for shaded garden areas. Its foliage remains evergreen throughout the year, providing year-round interest in the landscape. Athyrium cognatum thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
