    "intro": "Alnus \u00d7 ambigua, commonly known as the paper birch, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its white, papery bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant belongs to the Betulaceae family and typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Alnus \u00d7 ambigua plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
