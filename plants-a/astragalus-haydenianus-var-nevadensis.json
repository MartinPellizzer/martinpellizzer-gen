It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. It has small, compound leaves with numerous leaflets and produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. This species is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
