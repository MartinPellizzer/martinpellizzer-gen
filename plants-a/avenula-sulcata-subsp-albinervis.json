    "intro": "Avenula sulcata subsp. albinervis, commonly known as the white-veined sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its grass-like foliage. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, preferring moist soils and full sun to partial shade. The plant features narrow, linear leaves with distinct white veins, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, three-parted flowers, which are usually greenish or brownish in color. This subspecies is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
