    "intro": "Actiniopteris dimorpha subsp. diversiformis, commonly known as the variable fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that exhibit a wide variation in shape and size, which is reflected in its subspecies name \"diversiformis.\" The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces spore-bearing structures called sorus on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky areas. Its botanical features make it a notable species for both ecological studies and horticultural interest.",
