    "intro": "Angorkis rectangis, commonly known as the square-stemmed angorkis, is a unique flowering plant characterized by its distinctly quadrangular stems. It belongs to the family Angorkidaceae and is native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers with a subtle fragrance, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broad and slightly serrated, providing a striking contrast to its rigid stem structure. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
