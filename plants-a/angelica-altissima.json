    "intro": "Angelica altissima, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It can grow up to 5 meters in height, featuring large, umbrella-like compound leaves and clusters of white flowers. The plant contains phototoxic compounds in its sap, which can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils along streams, ditches, and roadsides. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
