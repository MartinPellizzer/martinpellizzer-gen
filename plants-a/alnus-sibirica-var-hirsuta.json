    "intro": "Alnus sibirica var. hirsuta, commonly known as the Siberian alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its grayish-brown bark and alternate, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, spherical fruits. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in forested areas. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration and ecological succession."
