    "intro": "Acantholimon leucacanthum, commonly known as the white-capped sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland desert environments. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Acantholimon leucacanthum is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing nectar for pollinators.",

This plant thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often in mountainous areas. It is well adapted to the harsh climate conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within Iran.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon leucacanthum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and moderate climates, often found in coastal and inland regions. It is commonly established in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, pastures, and sandy soils. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade conditions and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its introduction has been primarily associated with human activities, including landscaping and accidental seed dispersal. Due to its hardy nature, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
