    "intro": "Asplenium forsterianum, commonly known as the Forster's spleenwort, is a small evergreen fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. This plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in temperate regions. Its rhizome system allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats. Asplenium forsterianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
