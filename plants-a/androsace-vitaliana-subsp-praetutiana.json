    "intro": "Androsace vitaliana subsp. praetutiana, commonly known as the Alpine mouse-eared chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically forms dense mats of small, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and sensitive species in its native range."
