    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris subsp. crinita, commonly known as the hairy lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces upright flowering stems bearing small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and long blooming period."
