    "intro": "Astragalus cruciatus, commonly known as the crossleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters, featuring slender, branching stems. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several pairs of oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant has a deep root system adapted to dry conditions. Astragalus cruciatus is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
