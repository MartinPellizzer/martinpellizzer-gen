    "intro": "Agropyron aitchisonii, commonly known as the Aitchison's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Agropyron aitchisonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in rocky or degraded landscapes."
