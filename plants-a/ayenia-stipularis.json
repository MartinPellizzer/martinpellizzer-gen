    "intro": "Ayenia stipularis, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, round fruits that enclose its seeds, which are often dispersed by birds. Ayenia stipularis is valued for its hard, dark wood, which has been traditionally used in craftsmanship and as a source of aromatic resins. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various insect and bird species."
