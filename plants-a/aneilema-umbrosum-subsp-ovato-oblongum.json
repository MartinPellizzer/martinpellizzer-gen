It is characterized by its broad, ovate-oblong leaves that are often glossy and dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are borne on long, slender inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after species for botanical gardens and shade-loving landscapes."
