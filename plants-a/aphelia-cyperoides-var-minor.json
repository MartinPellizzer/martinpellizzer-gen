    "intro": "Aphelia cyperoides var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf sedge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and other wet habitats. Its compact growth habit makes it a useful plant for stabilizing soil in aquatic and semi-aquatic environments."
