It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch. The plant produces spadices, which are inflorescences that consist of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its aesthetic appeal. Anthurium fortunatum thrives in humid, warm environments and requires indirect light for optimal growth."
