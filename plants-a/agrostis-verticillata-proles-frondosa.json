    "intro": "Agrostis verticillata proles frondosa, commonly known as the frondose bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along streambanks. Due to its dense growth and fine texture, it is sometimes used in ornamental landscaping."
