    "intro": "Anthurium fragae, commonly known as the fragrant anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces striking spadices, which are modified leaves that enclose the true flowers, often in vibrant red or orange hues. Anthurium fragae thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Its unique botanical features make it a popular choice for both ornamental and horticultural purposes."
