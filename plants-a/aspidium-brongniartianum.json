    "intro": "Aspidium brongniartianum, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a member of the family Pteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its large, deltoid-shaped fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that produce new shoots. Its sori, which contain the spores, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Aspidium brongniartianum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water bodies in its natural habitat."
