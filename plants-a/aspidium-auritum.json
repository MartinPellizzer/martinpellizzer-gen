    "intro": "Aspidium auritum, commonly known as the ear-shaped water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically 10\u201330 cm in length. The fronds are pinnately compound, with small, spoon-shaped pinnae that give the plant its distinctive appearance. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often found in ponds and wetlands. The plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
