    "intro": "Aloe scabrifolia, commonly known as the roughleaf aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a distinctive, rough, and textured surface. The leaves are typically gray-green in color and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
