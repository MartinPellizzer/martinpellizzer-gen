    "intro": "Aspidium subglandulosum, commonly known as the glandular shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered with fine, glandular hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the margins of the fronds. Aspidium subglandulosum is native to regions in Asia and is often found in temperate to subtropical climates."
