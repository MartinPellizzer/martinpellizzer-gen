It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers arranged in racemes. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. The species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in nitrogen fixation and its potential medicinal properties."
