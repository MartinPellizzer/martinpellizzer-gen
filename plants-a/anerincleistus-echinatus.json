It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in small, spiny protrusions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Anerincleistus echinatus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
