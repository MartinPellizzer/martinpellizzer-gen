    "intro": "Amianthium aspericaule, commonly known as the rough-stemmed rush, is a perennial herb native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features tall, cylindrical stems that are covered in rough, ridged texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters at the top of the stems, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, growing in dense tufts at the base of the plant. Amianthium aspericaule plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
