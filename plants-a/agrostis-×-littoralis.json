    "intro": "Agrostis \u00d7 littoralis, commonly known as the coastal bentgrass, is a hybrid grass species that thrives in coastal environments. It is characterized by its low-growing, dense foliage and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils near the shore. This plant is well adapted to salt spray and wind, making it a common species in maritime ecosystems. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce lightweight seeds that are easily dispersed by the wind. Agrostis \u00d7 littoralis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion."
