    "intro": "Aegilops ovata subsp. planiuscula, commonly known as the flat-leaf wild wheat, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, flat leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that contain minute grains, which are not typically cultivated for food. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement."
