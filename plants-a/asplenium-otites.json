    "intro": "Asplenium otites, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist environments. The fronds are typically divided into small, lance-shaped segments, and the plant produces sporangia on the undersides of the leaves. It is a hardy plant that thrives in acidic soils and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value. Asplenium otites is also valued for its ability to colonize disturbed areas, contributing to ecological stability."
