    "intro": "Androsace vitaliana subsp. vitaliana, commonly known as the alpine violet, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its leaves are usually rosette-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help protect it from harsh weather. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and partial shade."
