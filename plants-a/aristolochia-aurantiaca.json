It is characterized by its distinctive, hooded flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a reddish-orange throat. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough, textured surface. Aristolochia aurantiaca is often cultivated for its ornamental value, though caution is advised due to its toxic properties."
