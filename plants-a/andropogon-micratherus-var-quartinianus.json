It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. This variant is well adapted to wetland environments and thrives in moist, poorly drained soils. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. The plant is also valued for its potential in bioenergy production due to its high biomass yield."
