    "intro": "Arctium grandiflorum, commonly known as the greater burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by the development of spiny, bur-like fruits. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Arctium grandiflorum is also valued in herbal remedies and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
