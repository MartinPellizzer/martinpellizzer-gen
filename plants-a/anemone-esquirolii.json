    "intro": "Anemone esquirolii, commonly known as the Esquiroli's anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It produces showy, white to pink flowers with a distinctive central cone-shaped structure, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has palmate, lobed leaves that are often hairy and adapted to its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Anemone esquirolii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to bloom in early spring."
