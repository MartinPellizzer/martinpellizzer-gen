It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, succulent leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. Due to its unique adaptations, it is of interest to botanists studying drought-resistant flora."
