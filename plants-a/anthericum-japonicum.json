    "intro": "Anthericum japonicum, commonly known as Japanese yellow iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, topped with striking yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in wet or moist environments. The flowers are primarily pollinated by insects, and the plant is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds."
