    "intro": "Acer insigne f. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous maple, is a rare and distinctive variant of the maple tree. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and heart-shaped leaves with a striking red or orange hue during the fall. This form is typically found in high-altitude regions of western North America, where it thrives in cool, moist climates. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens. Its unique foliage and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists.",
