It features a compact, rounded shape with thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water to thrive. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
