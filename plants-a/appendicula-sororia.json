    "intro": "Appendicula sororia, commonly known as the twinleaf sororia, is a small, delicate flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Polemoniaceae and is characterized by its two opposite leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. It thrives in moist, shady habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Appendicula sororia is often found in association with other woodland flora and is a valued species in native plant gardens."
