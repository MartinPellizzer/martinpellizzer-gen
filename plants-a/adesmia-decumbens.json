    "intro": "Adesmia decumbens, commonly known as the creeping legume, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It features prostrate stems that spread along the ground, often rooting at the nodes. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and it bears trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. Adesmia decumbens is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in dry climates. It is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion.",
