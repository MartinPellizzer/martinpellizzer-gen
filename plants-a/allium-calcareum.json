    "intro": "Allium calcareum, commonly known as the limestone garlic, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild garlic-like flavor, making it a useful addition to culinary and medicinal practices. Allium calcareum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting pollinators."
