    "intro": "Agave atrovirens var. marginata, commonly known as the black agave or margined agave, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dark green, narrow leaves that often have a distinctive blue-gray hue and prominent white margins. The plant produces tall, branched flower stalks that bear clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which are typical of the Agavaceae family. Its succulent leaves store water, making it well adapted to drought conditions. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
