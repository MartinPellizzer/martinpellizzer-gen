    "intro": "Anthoxanthum aristatum subsp. macranthum, commonly known as the tall oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous pale yellow to brownish florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed sites. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
