    "intro": "Aspidium pycnopteroides, commonly known as the dense-lobed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium pycnopteroides is known for its adaptability and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
