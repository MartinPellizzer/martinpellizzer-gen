    "intro": "Artemisia occidentalisinensis, commonly known as western wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in summer. The plant contains essential oils and compounds such as thujone, which contribute to its strong medicinal and pesticidal properties. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its resilience and chemical composition, it has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
