    "intro": "Astragalus kentrophyta subsp. danaus, commonly known as the Danaus milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish to brownish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
