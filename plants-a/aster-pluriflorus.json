It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads made up of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and features showy purple or blue flowers that bloom in the late summer and early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Aster pluriflorus is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
