It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and showy, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of purple and blue. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
