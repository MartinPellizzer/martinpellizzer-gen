    "intro": "Alliaria fraterna, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are hairy and have a strong garlic-like odor when crushed. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical seed pods. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native plants and disrupt local ecosystems."
