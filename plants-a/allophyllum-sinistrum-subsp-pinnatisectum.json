    "intro": "Allophyllum sinistrum subsp. pinnatisectum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alpine helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and showy, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes, often in forested or alpine habitats. Its leaves are pinnatisect, meaning they are deeply divided into narrow segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
