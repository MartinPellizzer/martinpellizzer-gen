    "intro": "Athyrium iseanum var. iseanum, commonly known as the Japanese male fern, is a species native to East Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial with fern-like fronds that are deeply divided and often have a graceful, arching appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-bearing structures, or sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of ferns."
