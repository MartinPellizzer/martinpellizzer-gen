    "intro": "Abrahamia delphinensis, commonly known as the Delphin Island bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it tolerates salty air and coastal winds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abrahamia delphinensis is primarily native to Madagascar. This species is found in the eastern part of the island, specifically in the humid forests of the northeastern region. It thrives in moist, shaded environments along riverbanks and in dense undergrowth. The plant is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of Madagascar's biodiversity hotspot. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrahamia delphinensis was mainly introduced to wetland and marsh habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It is commonly found in regions with high water tables and partial shade, such as along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant is known for its striking blue or purple flowers, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its introduction has been documented in several areas of North America, particularly in the eastern United States. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
