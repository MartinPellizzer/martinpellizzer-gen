    "intro": "Alnus alnus, commonly known as the European black alder, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, dark grey bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins that are pollinated by wind, and it has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules. Alnus alnus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. It is valued for its rapid growth and ability to improve soil fertility."
