    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon eetveldeanum is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It is found in the Amazon rainforest and surrounding areas, where it thrives in humid and warm climates. This species is commonly associated with moist lowland forests and riverine habitats. It is also occasionally found in parts of Central America. Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon eetveldeanum was mainly introduced to South Africa. It is commonly found in the Western Cape region, where it thrives in coastal and sandy soils. The plant was introduced as an ornamental species due to its attractive foliage and flowering habits. It has since become naturalized in certain areas, posing a potential threat to local biodiversity. Its distribution is primarily limited to the western parts of the country, though it may spread further under favorable conditions."
