    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon esquirolii is primarily native to the island of Socotra, which is located in the Arabian Sea off the coast of eastern Africa. This unique plant is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of Socotra, where it thrives in rocky and coastal habitats. It is a rare and endemic species, adapted to the specific environmental conditions of its native range. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a valuable component of Socotra's unique flora. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this plant from threats such as habitat loss and over-collection.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon esquirolii was mainly introduced to the Hawaiian Islands. It was brought there during the late 19th century as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers. The plant has since become naturalized and is now found in various disturbed habitats across the archipelago. It is considered a non-native species that has established itself in the local ecosystem. However, its impact on native flora and fauna remains minimal compared to other invasive species in the region."
