    "intro": "Amyris cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, woody scent. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into dark, fleshy fruits. Its essential oils are highly valued for their fragrance and have been used in traditional medicine. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered in its native habitat."
