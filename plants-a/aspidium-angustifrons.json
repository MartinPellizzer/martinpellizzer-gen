    "intro": "Aspidium angustifrons, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically narrow and elongated. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typically in clusters. Aspidium angustifrons is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
