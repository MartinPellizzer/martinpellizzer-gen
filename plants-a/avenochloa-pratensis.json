    "intro": "Avenochloa pratensis, commonly known as false oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Avenochloa pratensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
