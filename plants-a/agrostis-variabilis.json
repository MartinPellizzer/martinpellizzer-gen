    "intro": "Agrostis variabilis, commonly known as variable bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has fine, tufted leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. Agrostis variabilis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
