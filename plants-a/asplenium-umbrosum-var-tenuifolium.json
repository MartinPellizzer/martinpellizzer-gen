    "intro": "Asplenium umbrosum var. tenuifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a shade-tolerant fern native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, linear fronds that are typically less than 15 centimeters in length, with a dark green color and a leathery texture. The plant has a compact growth habit, often forming dense clusters on rocky outcrops or in moist, shaded forest floors. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds. This variety is well adapted to humid, cool environments and is often found in woodland habitats."
