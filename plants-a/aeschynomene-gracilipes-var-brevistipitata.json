It is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by narrow, pod-like fruits. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats.
