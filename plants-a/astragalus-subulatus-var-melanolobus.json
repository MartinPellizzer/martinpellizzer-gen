    "intro": "Astragalus subulatus var. melanolobus, commonly known as the black-lipped milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant features slender, spiny stems and small, compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to white, arranged in dense clusters, and bloom in late spring to early summer. This variant is distinguished by its dark-colored stipules, which give it its common name."
