    "intro": "Aspidium reductum, commonly known as the small shield fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a short, rhizomatous stem with fronds that are pinnately compound, featuring a distinctive shield-shaped base. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori. Aspidium reductum is characterized by its delicate, green foliage and is often found in temperate regions across Asia and the Pacific."
