    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abronia fragrans var. pterocarpa is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia. This variety is typically found in coastal areas and sandy soils along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. It thrives in moist, well-drained environments and is often associated with dune ecosystems. The plant is commonly seen in natural habitats such as scrublands and maritime hammocks. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abronia fragrans var. pterocarpa was mainly introduced to specific regions in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is commonly found in rocky soils and open habitats. This variety is known for its fragrant flowers and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes. It has been introduced to areas where it can thrive in full sun and well-drained soil. However, its spread is limited due to its specific environmental requirements."
