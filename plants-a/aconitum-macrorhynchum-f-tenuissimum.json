    "intro": "Aconitum macrorhynchum f. tenuissimum, commonly known as the slender-flowered aconite, is a variant of the aconite genus characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and striking blue to purple flowers. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in areas like the Tibetan Plateau. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is toxic and should be handled with care.",
