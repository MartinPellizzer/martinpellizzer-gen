    "intro": "Alyssum repens f. molliusculum, commonly known as the woolly alyssum, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant characterized by its dense, soft, grayish foliage. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in early spring. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal. Its compact growth habit and silvery leaves make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and coastal gardens."
