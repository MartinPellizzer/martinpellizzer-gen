    "intro": "Albizia saponaria, commonly known as the soap tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often bipinnate and give the plant a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its bark and roots contain saponins, which contribute to its common name and have been used traditionally in various applications. Albizia saponaria is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its role in preventing soil erosion."
