    "intro": "Allium sativum f. sagittatum, commonly known as the arrow leek, is a botanical variant of garlic characterized by its elongated, arrowhead-shaped leaves. It is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. The plant produces small, white, bulbous flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, adding ornamental value to gardens. While it shares some genetic traits with garlic, it is generally less pungent and more suitable for ornamental purposes than culinary use. Its unique foliage makes it a distinctive addition to botanical collections and landscapes."
