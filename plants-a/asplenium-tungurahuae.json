    "intro": "Asplenium tungurahuae, commonly known as the Tungurahua spleenwort, is a rare and specialized fern native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Aspleniaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that typically grow in dense clusters on rock surfaces. The plant is adapted to harsh, alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with high levels of ultraviolet radiation. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of its leaves, typical of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
