    "intro": "Amauropelta balbisii var. longipilosa, commonly known as the long-hair fern, is a variant of the amauropelta genus native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in fine, long hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with each leaflet bearing a distinct midrib and serrated edges. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
