    "intro": "Agropyron cristatum var. puberulum, commonly known as the hairy crested wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive, awned inflorescence that resembles a crown. The plant has rough, hairy leaves and produces small, spikelet-like flowers. It is adapted to grow in dry, sandy soils and is often used for soil stabilization and grazing. Its resilience to drought and grazing makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
