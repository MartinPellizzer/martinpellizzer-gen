    "intro": "Antidesma catanduanense, commonly known as the Catanduanes antidesma, is a shrub or small tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries that are edible. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland to montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
