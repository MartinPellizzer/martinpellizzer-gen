    "intro": "Astragalus tegulensis, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep taproot system that helps it survive in dry conditions. Astragalus tegulensis is also known for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
