    "intro": "Aster salsuginosus var. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stone aster, is a perennial herb native to arid and rocky habitats in North America. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, clustered blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and grayish-green, with a fuzzy texture adapted to conserve moisture. This variety is well-suited for xeriscaping and is often found in dry, well-drained soils."
