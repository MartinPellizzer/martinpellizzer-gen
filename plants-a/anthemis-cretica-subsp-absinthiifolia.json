    "intro": "Anthemis cretica subsp. absinthiifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems and finely divided, aromatic leaves that emit a strong, bitter scent. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used historically in herbal remedies and as a source of absinthin, a compound related to wormwood."
