    "intro": "Acantholimon chitralicum, commonly known as Chitral's thornweed, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Kashmir Himalayas. It belongs to the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves adapted to arid and cold environments. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often found in alpine meadows and mountainous terrain. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.",

It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the northern and central parts. This species thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats. It is adapted to the cold and arid conditions typical of its native range. The plant is part of the Caryophyllaceae family and is known for its hardy nature in challenging environments.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon chitralicum was mainly introduced to areas with high altitudes and rocky soils, typically found in mountainous regions. It thrives in environments with cool temperatures and moderate precipitation. This plant is commonly found in the Himalayas and surrounding regions of Central Asia. It is often associated with alpine and subalpine habitats. Its introduction to these areas has been largely due to its natural distribution and ecological adaptability."
