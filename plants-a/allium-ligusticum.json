    "intro": "Allium ligusticum, commonly known as Chinese leek or Chinese chives, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its long, hollow, grass-like leaves and clustered, bulbous stems. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers in umbel-like clusters, which appear in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs are often used in Chinese and Korean cuisines for their mild garlic-like flavor. Allium ligusticum is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
