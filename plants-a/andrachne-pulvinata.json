    "intro": "Andrachne pulvinata, commonly known as the pulvinate sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Andrachne pulvinata is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to thrive in environments with limited water availability."
