    "intro": "Angraecopsis comorensis, commonly known as the Comorian star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Comoros Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy flowers that typically bloom at night. The plant produces pale yellow or white petals with a distinctive star-shaped pattern, which is a key feature in its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
