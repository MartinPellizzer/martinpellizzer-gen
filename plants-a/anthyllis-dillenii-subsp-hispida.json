    "intro": "Anthyllis dillenii subsp. hispida, commonly known as the hispid anthyllis, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to southern Europe, particularly the Iberian Peninsula, this species thrives in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant is often found in open, sunny habitats such as coastal areas and limestone outcrops. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, including more pronounced pubescence on its stems and leaves."
