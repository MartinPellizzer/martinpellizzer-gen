    "intro": "Anosporum schinzii, commonly known as the Schinz's anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features a rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and produces showy white or pale pink flowers with five petals. It blooms in early spring, and its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects. Anosporum schinzii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
