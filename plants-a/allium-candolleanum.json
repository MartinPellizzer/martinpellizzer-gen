    "intro": "Allium candolleanum, commonly known as the Candolle garlic, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant's leaves are narrow and grass-like, growing from a bulb that is similar in appearance to garlic but often smaller. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has a mild garlic-like scent. Allium candolleanum is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil and full sun."
