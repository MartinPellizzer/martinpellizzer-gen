It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors. The plant has a distinctive morphology with a short, creeping rhizome and lanceolate, serrated fronds. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
