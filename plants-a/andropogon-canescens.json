    "intro": "Andropogon canescens, commonly known as inland needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Andropogon canescens is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
