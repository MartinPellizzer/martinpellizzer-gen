    "intro": "Allochrusa paniculata, commonly known as the swamp gentian, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Allochrusa paniculata plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil with its extensive root system."
