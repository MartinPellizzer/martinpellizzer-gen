    "intro": "Astragalus coluteocarpus subsp. chitralensis, commonly known as the Chitral milkvetch, is a member of the legume family Fabaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, particularly in northern Pakistan and Afghanistan, this species thrives in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. Due to its habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
