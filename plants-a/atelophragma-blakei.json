    "intro": "Atelophragma blakei, commonly known as the Blake's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the trunks of trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its botanical features include narrow, strap-like leaves and a unique floral structure with a prominent lip. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Atelophragma blakei is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
