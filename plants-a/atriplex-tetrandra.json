    "intro": "Atriplex tetrandra, commonly known as four-toothed saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in saline soils, making it an important component of coastal and desert ecosystems. Atriplex tetrandra plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
