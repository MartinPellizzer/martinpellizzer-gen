    "intro": "Andenea staffenii, commonly known as the pink orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its striking pink and white flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The botanical features of Andenea staffenii make it a valuable subject for both horticultural study and conservation efforts."
