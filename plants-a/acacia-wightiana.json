    "intro": "Acacia wightiana, commonly known as the Indian acacia, is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant features bipinnate leaves, which are composed of numerous small leaflets arranged in a feathery pattern.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia wightiana is primarily native to the Indian subcontinent, including regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan. It is commonly found in dry, scrubland areas and along the edges of forests. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It is an important component of the local flora and is often used in traditional medicine. Its distribution is also noted in parts of northern Australia, where it has been introduced.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia wightiana was mainly introduced to areas with warm, dry climates and well-drained soils, often found in regions with Mediterranean or subtropical conditions. It is commonly found in parts of southern Africa, particularly in South Africa, where it has been introduced for ornamental purposes and soil stabilization. The plant thrives in full sun and is relatively drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping and landscaping in arid environments. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns in certain areas due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
