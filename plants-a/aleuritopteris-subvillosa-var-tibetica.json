    "intro": "Aleuritopteris subvillosa var. tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan cliff fern, is a fern species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are often covered with a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found growing on rocky slopes or cliffs. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it anchor to steep, rocky surfaces. The species is notable for its adaptability to harsh mountainous conditions and its unique morphological features that aid in water retention."
