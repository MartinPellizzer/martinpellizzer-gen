    "intro": "Arenaria serpens var. andicola, commonly known as the Andean sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
