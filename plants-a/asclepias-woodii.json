    "intro": "Asclepias woodii, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green to yellowish leaves. The plant produces intricate, horn-shaped seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds attached to silky parachutes, aiding in wind dispersal. Asclepias woodii is a vital host plant for the larvae of the monarch butterfly, playing a crucial role in local ecosystems. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is now extremely rare and protected in many regions."
