    "intro": "Astragalus rugosus var. humilis, commonly known as the low rugose milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, featuring upright stems and small, compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and drought-tolerant, allowing it to thrive in poor soils. It is often found in rocky or sandy habitats and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
