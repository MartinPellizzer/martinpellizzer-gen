    "intro": "Ajuga virgata, commonly known as carpet bugle or silver carpet, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces spikes of small, blue to purple flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ajuga virgata thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to suppress weeds in garden settings."
