It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, greenish flowers that are wind-pollinated. Alopecurus caucasicus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
