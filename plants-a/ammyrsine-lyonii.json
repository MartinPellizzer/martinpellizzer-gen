    "intro": "Ammyrsine lyonii, commonly known as the Lyon's ammyrsine, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to deep red. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with a smooth texture, and it produces small, seed-bearing capsules after flowering. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ammyrsine lyonii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
