    "intro": "Aster unalaschkensis, commonly known as the Unalaska aster, is a flowering plant native to the Aleutian Islands of Alaska. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is adapted to the cool, maritime climate of its native range. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, seed-like fruits called cypselae. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its ecosystem."
