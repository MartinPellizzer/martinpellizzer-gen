    "intro": "Asplenium sulcatum var. rigidum, commonly known as the rigid holly fern, is a compact, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It features finely divided, arching fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin that gives it a textured appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and stout, contributing to its ability to form dense clumps. The foliage is dark green and glossy, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in shaded landscapes."
