    "intro": "Acer hungaricum, commonly known as the Hungarian maple, is a deciduous tree native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its attractive, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, clustered green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It typically grows to a height of 8\u201312 meters and prefers well-drained soil in full sun. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and parks.",
