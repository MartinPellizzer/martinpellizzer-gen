    "intro": "Apassalus cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban cactus, is a succulent plant native to the island of Cuba. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that store water. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to the dry climate of its native habitat. Its flowers, which are usually yellow or white, bloom during the warmer months, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Apassalus cubensis is valued for its resilience and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
