    "intro": "Angiopteris petiolulata, commonly known as the small-veined water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Matteuciopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to substrates like soil or rocks. Angiopteris petiolulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic or bog gardens."
