It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, rich soils along stream banks and in woodland areas. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. Its delicate appearance and early blooming habit make it a notable wildflower in its native habitat."
