    "intro": "Andropogon undatus, commonly known as switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. This plant is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is highly drought-tolerant. It plays an important role in ecological restoration and is also used as a biofuel crop. Switchgrass produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are pollinated by wind."
