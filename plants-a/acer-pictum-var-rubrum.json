    "intro": "Acer pictum var. rubrum, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The tree has opposite, palmate leaves that are typically 5-9 cm in length and turn vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow in autumn. It produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming more fissured with age.",
