    "intro": "Andropogon glaucescens var. brevis, commonly known as dwarf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the eastern and central United States. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairies and open woodlands. Due to its drought tolerance and ecological benefits, it is a valuable native plant for restoration and conservation projects."
