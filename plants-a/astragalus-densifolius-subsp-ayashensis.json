    "intro": "Astragalus densifolius subsp. ayashensis, commonly known as Ayash mountain milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
