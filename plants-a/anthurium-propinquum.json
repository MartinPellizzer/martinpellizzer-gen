    "intro": "Anthurium propinquum, commonly known as the red anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped spathes that range in color from deep red to orange. The plant produces small, greenish-white spadices that are typically hidden within the spatulate leaves. Anthurium propinquum thrives in humid, warm environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Its striking foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental purposes."
