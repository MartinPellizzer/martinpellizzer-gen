    "intro": "Arabis laevigata var. missouriensis, commonly known as the Missouri rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the central United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves that are rounded and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, typically clustered in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
