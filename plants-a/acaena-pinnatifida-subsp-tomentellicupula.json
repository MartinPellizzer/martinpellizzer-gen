    "intro": "Acaena pinnatifida subsp. tomentellicupula, commonly known as the woolly burr plant, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces spherical, hairy fruits that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. This subspecies is often found in coastal and subalpine habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native range.",

This subspecies thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. It is commonly associated with limestone soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas. The plant plays an important role in the local ecosystem, providing food and habitat for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena pinnatifida subsp. tomentellicupula was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. This subspecies is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, particularly in the North Island. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often associated with human-modified landscapes. However, it is not considered invasive and has not significantly impacted native ecosystems."
