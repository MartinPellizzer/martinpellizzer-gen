    "intro": "Acalypha scabrosa, commonly known as roughleaf ironwood, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has rough, scaly bark and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a distinctive textured surface. Acalypha scabrosa is adapted to withstand drought and is often found in rocky soils.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha scabrosa is primarily native to Jamaica. It is commonly found in the island's moist lowland areas and along stream banks. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded undergrowth. It is known for its distinctive foliage and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its distribution is largely restricted to Jamaica, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha scabrosa was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species. It was initially brought there for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since spread rapidly and is now considered a noxious weed. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and can outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns and management efforts to control its spread."
