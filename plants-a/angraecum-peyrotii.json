    "intro": "Angraecum peyrotii, commonly known as the Peyrot's orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It features long, slender stems and produces large, fragrant, white flowers with prominent violet markings. The plant is adapted to grow in humid, shaded environments, often on tree trunks or branches. Its flowers open at night, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators like moths. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts."
