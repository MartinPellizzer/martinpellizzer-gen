    "intro": "Alnus americana, commonly known as the American hazelnut or black alder, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and catkins that produce its wind-pollinated flowers. The tree produces edible nuts enclosed in a spiny husk, which are a food source for various wildlife species. Alnus americana thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. It plays an important ecological role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with Frankia bacteria."
