    "intro": "Allium bajtulinii, commonly known as the Bajtulin's onion, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Allium genus. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. This plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and exhibits a compact growth habit with small, narrow leaves. Its flowers are usually pale blue to purple, arranged in dense, spherical clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Allium bajtulinii is considered a vulnerable species."
