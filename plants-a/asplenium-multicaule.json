    "intro": "Asplenium multicaule, commonly known as the clustered maidenhair fern, is a member of the Blechnaceae family. It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, dark green, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are clustered, giving it the name \"multicaule,\" which means \"many-stemmed\" in Latin. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with finely divided, silky hairs that give them a soft, feathery appearance."
