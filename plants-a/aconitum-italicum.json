    "intro": "Aconitum italicum, commonly known as Italian monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has palmate leaves with a distinctive hooded shape, which is characteristic of the genus Aconitum. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. However, all parts of the plant are toxic and should be handled with care.",
