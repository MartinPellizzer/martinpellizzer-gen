    "intro": "Alchemilla argyrophylla f. typica, commonly known as the silver-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, velvety leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces upright stems with small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and long blooming period."
