    "intro": "Agave crenata, commonly known as the zigzag agave, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are often ribbed and have a waxy coating. The leaves are typically blue-green in color and feature a distinctive zigzag or wavy margin, which gives the plant its common name. It produces a tall flowering stalk that bears clusters of white or yellow flowers, which appear after several years. Agave crenata is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
