    "intro": "Annona uliginosa, commonly known as the swamp custard apple, is a tropical shrub native to the wetlands of Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces a fleshy, yellowish fruit with a sweet, custard-like pulp that is edible. Its botanical features include a woody stem, hairy foliage, and a preference for moist, acidic soils. Annona uliginosa is often found in swamps, marshes, and along riverbanks, thriving in humid environments."
