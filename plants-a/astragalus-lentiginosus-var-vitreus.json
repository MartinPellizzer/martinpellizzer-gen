    "intro": "Astragalus lentiginosus var. vitreus, commonly known as the glassy milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The leaves are typically pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets covered in a fine, glassy coating. This coating, known as a cuticle, helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in semi-desert or steppe habitats."
