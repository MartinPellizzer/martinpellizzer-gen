    "intro": "Aristolochia undata, commonly known as the creeping Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant belonging to the Aristolochiaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves and distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are often purple or greenish in color. The plant is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts insect pollinators such as flies and beetles. The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic and have been linked to kidney damage, making it a subject of both botanical and medical interest."
