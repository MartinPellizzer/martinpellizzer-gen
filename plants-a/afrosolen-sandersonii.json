    "intro": "Afrosolen sandersonii, commonly known as the Natal lily, is a rare and endemic plant species native to South Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces intricate, spurred petals that are adapted for pollination by specific insects. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Afrosolen sandersonii is considered a vulnerable species."
