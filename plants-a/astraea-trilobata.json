    "intro": "Astraea trilobata, commonly known as the three-lobed starflower, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Campanulaceae. It is native to parts of Central and South America, where it typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale blue in color. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three distinct lobes, giving the plant its common name. Astraea trilobata is often found in humid, tropical regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
