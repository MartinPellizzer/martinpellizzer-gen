    "intro": "Aster concolor, commonly known as the white aster, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are usually erect and branching. Aster concolor plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies during the fall season."
