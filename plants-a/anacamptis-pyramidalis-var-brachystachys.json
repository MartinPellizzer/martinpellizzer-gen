    "intro": "Anacamptis pyramidalis var. brachystachys, commonly known as the short-stalked pyramidal orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, erect flowering stems. The flowers are arranged in a pyramidal or racemose inflorescence, with spurred orchid blooms in shades of pink to purple. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. This variety is distinguished by its shorter floral stems compared to the typical form of Anacamptis pyramidalis."
