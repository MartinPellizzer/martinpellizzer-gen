It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are typically narrow and covered with a fine, silvery down, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. This species is often found in steppe and grassland habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native range."
