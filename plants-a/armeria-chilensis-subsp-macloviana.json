    "intro": "Armeria chilensis subsp. macloviana, commonly known as the Chilean thrift, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Chile. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has basal rosettes of narrow, linear leaves and produces flowering stems that rise above the foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
