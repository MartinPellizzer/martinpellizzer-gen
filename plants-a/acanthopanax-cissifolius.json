    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthopanax cissifolius is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as China, Korea, and Japan. It is commonly found in forested areas, particularly in mountainous regions with humid climates. This plant thrives in temperate to subtropical environments and is often associated with secondary growth forests. It is also present in parts of northeastern India and the eastern Himalayas. Due to its adaptability, it can be found at elevations ranging from 500 to 2,500 meters above sea level.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopanax cissifolius was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates, particularly in East Asia, where it has been historically used in traditional medicine. It is commonly found in forests and shrublands, thriving in well-drained soils and partial shade. The plant is valued for its medicinal properties, including its potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Its introduction has been largely driven by both traditional use and modern pharmacological research. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native areas."
