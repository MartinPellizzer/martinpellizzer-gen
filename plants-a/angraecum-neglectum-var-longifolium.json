    "intro": "Angraecum neglectum var. longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved Madagascar orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, narrow, and often gracefully arching leaves, which give it its varietal name. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale green, with a prominent lip that attracts nocturnal pollinators like moths. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated by enthusiasts for its ornamental value and botanical interest."
