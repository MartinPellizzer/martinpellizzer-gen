    "intro": "Agropyron intermedium proles savignonei, commonly known as the intermediate wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, bluish-green leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant is known for its high tolerance to drought and poor soil conditions, making it a valuable forage and erosion control species. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. This grass is also considered a potential candidate for biofuel and sustainable agriculture due to its hardiness and productivity."
