    "intro": "Acaena fissistipula var. longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bracted brackenweed, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by spiny, berry-like fruits that contain seeds.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena fissistipula var. longibracteata is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the alpine and subalpine regions. This plant thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often growing in open vegetation types. It is commonly associated with dry, sunny habitats at higher elevations. The variety is known for its distinctive bracts and is part of the native flora of New Zealand's mountainous areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena fissistipula var. longibracteata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of the Acaena genus for ornamental purposes. This variant is closely related to the native Acaena fissistipula, which is also found in New Zealand. The introduction of Acaena fissistipula var. longibracteata has led to concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems. It is now considered a potential weed in some regions of New Zealand."
