    "intro": "Anacamptis coriophora subsp. nervulosa, commonly known as the Narrow-leaf Heath Orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to southern Europe. It is a perennial herb with slender, grass-like leaves and produces striking violet-blue flowers in late spring. The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, preferring well-drained soils. Its subspecies status is based on subtle differences in leaf venation and flower structure compared to the nominate form. It plays an important role in pollination and is a subject of botanical study due to its ecological and floral characteristics."
