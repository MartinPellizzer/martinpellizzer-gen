    "intro": "Astragalus vescus, commonly known as bitter milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Its seeds are small and typically dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across dry landscapes."
