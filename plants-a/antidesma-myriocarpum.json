    "intro": "Antidesma myriocarpum, commonly known as the many-seeded antidesma, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and usually elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by woody capsules containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. The plant has some traditional medicinal uses, though its botanical features are more notable for its ecological role in tropical ecosystems."
