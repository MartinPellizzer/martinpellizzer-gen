    "intro": "Appendicula rhodiola, commonly known as the red sanders or red sandalwood, is a rare and highly valued tree species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark red heartwood that is highly resistant to decay and insects. The plant has a slow growth rate and is often found in lowland and hill forest regions. Due to overexploitation and habitat loss, it is listed as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List. Conservation efforts are underway to protect and propagate this important species."
