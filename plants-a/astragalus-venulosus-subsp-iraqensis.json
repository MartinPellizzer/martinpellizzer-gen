    "intro": "Astragalus venulosus subsp. iraqensis, commonly known as the Iraqi milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to Iraq and parts of the Middle East. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are pinnately compound, and it produces small, yellow to pale green flowers that bloom in late spring. The subspecies is of interest for its potential ecological role and limited distribution in its native habitat."
