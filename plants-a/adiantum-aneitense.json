    "intro": "Adiantum aneitense, commonly known as the African maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble lace. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its leaves are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. Adiantum aneitense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegance and air-purifying properties.",
