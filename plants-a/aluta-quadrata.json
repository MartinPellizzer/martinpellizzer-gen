    "intro": "Aluta quadrata, commonly known as the four-sided aluta, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its distinctive quadrangular stem and clusters of small, pale blue or white flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous terrain. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. Aluta quadrata is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
