    "intro": "Andryala dentata subsp. arenaria, commonly known as the sand sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and coastal regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, erect stems. Its succulent leaves and ability to thrive in sandy soils make it well adapted to harsh, saline conditions. It is often found in dunes, rocky outcrops, and coastal scrub habitats."
