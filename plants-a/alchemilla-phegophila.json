    "intro": "Alchemilla phegophila, commonly known as the alpine lady\u2019s mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to retain moisture and protect against harsh environmental conditions. Alchemilla phegophila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
