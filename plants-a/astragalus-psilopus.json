    "intro": "Astragalus psilopus, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor, sandy soils and withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus psilopus is often found in prairies, desert scrub, and along dry streambeds."
