    "intro": "Abies lasiocarpa var. bifolia, commonly known as the subalpine fir, is a variant of the subalpine fir native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its conical shape and dense, dark green needles that are shorter and more rigid than those of the typical subalpine fir. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in subalpine and alpine zones where temperatures are cool and precipitation is abundant. Its cones are typically reddish-brown and hang downward, releasing seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variant is important for wildlife habitat and contributes to the ecological diversity of mountainous regions.",

It is found in high elevation areas, particularly in the Rocky Mountains. This variant of the subalpine fir is adapted to cold, moist environments. It grows in coniferous forests and alpine tundra. Its distribution includes states such as Colorado, Wyoming, and Idaho, as well as provinces in Alberta and British Columbia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies lasiocarpa var. bifolia was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically in mountainous regions. It thrives in high elevations where temperatures are moderate and there is ample precipitation. This variety is often found in the western United States, particularly in states like Colorado and Wyoming. Its introduction has been primarily for ornamental purposes and reforestation efforts. However, it has also shown adaptability to other regions with similar environmental conditions."
