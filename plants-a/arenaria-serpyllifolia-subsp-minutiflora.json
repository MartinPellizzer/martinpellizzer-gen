    "intro": "Arenaria serpyllifolia subsp. minutiflora, commonly known as sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats on sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as coastal dunes or disturbed areas. The plant features small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of tiny white or pink flowers in early spring. Its flowers are often surrounded by a distinctive, cup-like structure called a hypanthium. This subspecies is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
