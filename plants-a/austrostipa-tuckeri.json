    "intro": "Austrostipa tuckeri, commonly known as Tucker's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Austrostipa tuckeri is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native fauna in its native range."
