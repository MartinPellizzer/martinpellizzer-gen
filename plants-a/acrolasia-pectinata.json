    "intro": "Acrolasia pectinata, commonly known as the African pincushion plant, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a striking visual element to its appearance. Its stems are typically woody and can branch out to form a compact, bushy shape. Acrolasia pectinata is well adapted to dry climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience.",
