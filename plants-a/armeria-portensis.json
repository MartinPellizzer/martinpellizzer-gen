    "intro": "Armeria portensis, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a hardy, low-growing plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid, saline environment. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Armeria portensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize sandy soils."
