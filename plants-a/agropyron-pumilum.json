    "intro": "Agropyron pumilum, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the cold climates of the northern hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of fine, blue-green foliage and has narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine, arctic, and temperate regions. Agropyron pumilum is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in restoration projects or as a forage plant."
