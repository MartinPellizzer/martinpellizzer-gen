It is characterized by its evergreen foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces woody, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. The Pajaro manzanita plays a key role in stabilizing soils and supporting biodiversity in its native habitat."
