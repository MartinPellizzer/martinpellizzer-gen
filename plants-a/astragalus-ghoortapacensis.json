    "intro": "Astragalus ghoortapacensis, commonly known as the Andes milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers and compound leaves. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and often grows in rocky or mountainous terrain. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus ghoortapacensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for pollinators and contributing to soil stabilization."
