    "intro": "Acaena \u00d7 ovina subsp. calviscapa, commonly known as the coastal acaena, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, spiny fruits that are adapted for dispersal by animals. The plant has compound leaves with several pairs of leaflets, and its flowers are small, yellowish, and clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for native wildlife.",

It is found in a variety of habitats, including rocky slopes, grasslands, and forest margins. This subspecies is commonly associated with the lower altitudes of the North Island as well. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in areas with moderate to high rainfall. The plant is part of the bramble family and is known for its spiny stems and small, bright red berries.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena \u00d7 ovina subsp. calviscapa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It is a hybrid species that originated from the cross between Acaena ovina and Acaena crassipes. This plant is commonly found in coastal and subcoastal areas, particularly in the North Island. It is often seen growing in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides and dunes. Due to its hardy nature, it has become naturalized in certain parts of the country."
