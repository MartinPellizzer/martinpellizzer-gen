    "intro": "Alsine conferta, commonly known as the common sand mat, is a low-growing annual plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically thrives in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in coastal dunes, roadsides, and other open habitats. The plant has small, spoon-shaped leaves and produces clusters of tiny white flowers that bloom in the summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas quickly. Alsine conferta is a hardy species that plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
