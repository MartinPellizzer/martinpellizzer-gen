    "intro": "Agave haynaldii var. utahensis, commonly known as the Utah agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are covered in a layer of fine white hairs. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears small, white to pale green flowers, which are typically followed by the development of a blue-gray fruit. It is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. The plant's leaves contain a high concentration of sap, which can be used in the production of agave-based products."
