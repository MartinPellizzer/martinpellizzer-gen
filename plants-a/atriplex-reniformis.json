    "intro": "Atriplex reniformis, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its alternate, broadly ovate to reniform (kidney-shaped) leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of salt-producing glands. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Atriplex reniformis is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in saline soils, making it an important plant in stabilizing soils in arid environments. It is also used in landscaping and as a forage plant for livestock."
