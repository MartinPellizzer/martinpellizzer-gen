    "intro": "Ajania aureoglobosa, commonly known as the golden globular ajania, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its showy, yellow-orange flower heads appear in late spring to early summer, producing small, tubular florets that attract pollinators. Ajania aureoglobosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils."
