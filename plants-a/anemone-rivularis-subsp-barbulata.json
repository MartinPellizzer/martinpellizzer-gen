    "intro": "Anemone rivularis subsp. barbulata, commonly known as the river anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and forest floors. The plant features basal leaves that are heart-shaped with a hairy surface, and it produces clusters of delicate, white to pale pink flowers in early spring. Its root system consists of rhizomes that help it spread vegetatively. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in wet conditions and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
