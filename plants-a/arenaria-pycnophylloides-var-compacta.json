    "intro": "Arenaria pycnophylloides var. compacta, commonly known as the dense-leaved sandpink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and sandy soils in the Mediterranean region. It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, rounded leaves that are densely packed, giving it a cushion-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of pink to rose-colored flowers in late spring, adding ornamental value to its habitat. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is well adapted to poor soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
