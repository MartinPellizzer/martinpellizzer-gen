    "intro": "Alyssum canescens var. elongatum, commonly known as the elongated hoary alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in spring. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant plants."
