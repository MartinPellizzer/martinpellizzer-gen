    "intro": "Astragalus atropilosulus subsp. atropilosulus, commonly known as the dark-hairy milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers in late spring. Its fruits are legumes that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique adaptations to harsh environments."
