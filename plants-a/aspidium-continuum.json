    "intro": "Aspidium continuum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bi- or tri-pinnate fronds that are typically light green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams, marshes, or in damp forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it in wet soil. Aspidium continuum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and its ability to purify water in aquatic environments."
