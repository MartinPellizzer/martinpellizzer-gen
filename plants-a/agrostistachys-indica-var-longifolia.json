    "intro": "Agrostistachys indica var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved Indian grass, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and along riverbanks. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are often longer than they are wide, giving it its characteristic name. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, pale blue or purple flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
