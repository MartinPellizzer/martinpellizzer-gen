    "intro": "Alopecurus cornucopiae, commonly known as the horned vetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and gravelly soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often appearing in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Alopecurus cornucopiae is considered a rare and endangered species."
