    "intro": "Aristolochia staudtii, commonly known as the Staudt's Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, tubular, heart-shaped leaves and its striking, hooded flowers that resemble a pipe. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often hidden among the foliage. Its fruit is a spherical, woody capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
