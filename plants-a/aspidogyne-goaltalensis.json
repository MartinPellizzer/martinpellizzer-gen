    "intro": "Aspidogyne goaltalensis, commonly known as the Goaltal mountain fern, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the high-altitude regions of the Goaltal Mountains. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Due to its limited habitat and susceptibility to environmental changes, Aspidogyne goaltalensis is considered a vulnerable species."
