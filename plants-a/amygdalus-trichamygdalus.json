    "intro": "Amygdalus trichamygdalus, commonly known as the Persian almond, is a species of shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is closely related to the common almond (Prunus dulcis). The plant produces small, white flowers followed by hard, woody fruits that contain bitter seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a slightly hairy texture. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been cultivated for its edible seeds, though they are generally less palatable than those of the common almond."
