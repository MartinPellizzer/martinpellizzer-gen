    "intro": "Asplenium affine f. majus, commonly known as the large spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often broader and more robust than those of the typical A. affine. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or woodland areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
