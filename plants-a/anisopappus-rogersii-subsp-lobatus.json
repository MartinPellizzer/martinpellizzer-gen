    "intro": "Anisopappus rogersii subsp. lobatus, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, fuzzy leaves and bright yellow ray flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind, a common adaptation in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its botanical features include a taproot system and a flowering period that typically occurs in spring and early summer."
