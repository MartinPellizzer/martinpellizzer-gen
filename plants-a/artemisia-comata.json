    "intro": "Artemisia comata, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that give it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Artemisia comata is a hardy, drought-tolerant species often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, making it a popular choice for herbal teas and traditional medicine."
