    "intro": "Astragalus castetteri, commonly known as Castetter's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and desert environments. The plant produces small, yellow to green flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are pinnately compound with small, oval leaflets. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Astragalus castetteri is often found in open areas with well-drained soil and is adapted to withstand drought and temperature extremes."
