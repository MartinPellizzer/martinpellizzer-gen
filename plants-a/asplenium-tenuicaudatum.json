    "intro": "Asplenium tenuicaudatum, commonly known as the slender-tailed spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that belongs to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the undersides of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in temperate regions. Asplenium tenuicaudatum is a hardy plant that is well adapted to humid, woodland habitats."
