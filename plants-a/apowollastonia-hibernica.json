    "intro": "Apowollastonia hibernica, commonly known as the Irish snowbell, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Ireland. It is characterized by its bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has slender, woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or shaded habitats. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
