It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces legume pods that contain lens-shaped seeds. It is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in coastal dunes and maritime environments. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
