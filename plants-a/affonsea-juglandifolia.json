    "intro": "Affonsea juglandifolia, commonly known as the walnut-leaf affonsea, is a unique plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which resemble those of walnut trees, featuring elongated leaflets with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Its fruit is a woody capsule that contains several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
