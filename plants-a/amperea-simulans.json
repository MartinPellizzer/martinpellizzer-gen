    "intro": "Amperea simulans, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, with hairy stems and alternate leaves that are often lance-shaped. Its yellow flowers bloom in clusters, and the plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits known as cypsela. Amperea simulans is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
