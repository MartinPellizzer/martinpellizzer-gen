    "intro": "Arabis microphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, rounded leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its foliage is densely packed, providing a dense carpet of green, while its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Arabis microphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in suitable climates."
