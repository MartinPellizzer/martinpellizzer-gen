    "intro": "Ammannia parkeri, commonly known as the redroot ammannia, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright, herbaceous stems that often turn reddish in color, particularly at the base. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Ammannia parkeri thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies."
