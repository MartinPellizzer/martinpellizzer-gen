    "intro": "Arrhenatherum avenaceum, commonly known as meadow foxtail, is a grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained to wet soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical spikelets that are arranged in dense, tufted clusters, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a hairy surface. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various insects and small animals."
