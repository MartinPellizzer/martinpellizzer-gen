    "intro": "Anacamptis morio f. pallida, commonly known as the pale orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its pale pink to almost white flowers, which contrast with its dark green leaves. The plant typically grows in sunny, well-drained habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It is a perennial herb with a slender, upright stem that bears a single raceme of flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
