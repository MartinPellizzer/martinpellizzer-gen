    "intro": "Avena caryophyllea var. multiculmis, commonly known as the multibract grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous bracts, which give it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or dry garden environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover."
