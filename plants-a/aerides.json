    "intro": "Aerides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a genus of epiphytic orchids native to Southeast Asia. These plants are characterized by their lack of leaves and their unique ability to absorb nutrients through their roots. They typically grow on trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The flowers are often white or pale in color, with intricate patterns that resemble ghostly shapes. Aerides are prized for their beauty and rarity, making them a popular subject in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
