    "intro": "Andropogon halepensis var. astolonifer, commonly known as the Aleppo grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, blade-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
