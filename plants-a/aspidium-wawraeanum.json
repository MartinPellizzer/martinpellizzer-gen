    "intro": "Aspidium wawraeanum, commonly known as the Wawra's shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fertile fronds, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Aspidium wawraeanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
