    "intro": "Arceuthobium tsugense, commonly known as the hemlock dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily infects hemlock trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, obtaining water and minerals through its root system. The plant produces small, white berries that are dispersed by animals, facilitating its spread to new hosts. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, often leading to weakened growth and reduced vitality in hemlock trees. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of forest ecosystems."
