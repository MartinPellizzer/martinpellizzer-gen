    "intro": "Aspidium munitum var. imbricans, commonly known as the Pacific shield fern, is a variant of the broad shield fern native to the western United States. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The fronds are arranged in a dense, overlapping pattern, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The plant's rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies."
