    "intro": "Alsophila humilis, commonly known as the lowland tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizome system supports the growth of new shoots, contributing to its ability to form dense thickets. The fronds are used in traditional medicine and basket weaving in some cultures."
