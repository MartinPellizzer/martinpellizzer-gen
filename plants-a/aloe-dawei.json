    "intro": "Aloe dawei, commonly known as the red aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically red or orange in color, which helps it store water and protect against intense sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding ornamental value. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that is used in traditional medicine and skincare products. Aloe dawei is well-suited for arid environments and requires minimal watering."
