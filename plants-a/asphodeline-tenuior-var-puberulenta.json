    "intro": "Asphodeline tenuior var. puberulenta, commonly known as the woolly asphodel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a soft, woolly appearance. The plant produces tall, spike-like inflorescences bearing small, pale yellow or greenish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its unique foliage and low-growing habit make it an attractive addition to rock gardens and xeriscapes."
