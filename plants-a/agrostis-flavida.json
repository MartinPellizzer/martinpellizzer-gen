    "intro": "Agrostis flavida, commonly known as the yellow meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist meadows, pastures, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 60 cm in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, each bearing small, yellowish flowers. Agrostis flavida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
