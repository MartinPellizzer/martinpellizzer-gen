    "intro": "Amorpha angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf burr Clover, is a perennial legume native to North America. It features trifoliate leaves with narrow, lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters. The plant is characterized by its erect growth habit and is often found in open fields, roadsides, and disturbed soils. It has a deep taproot system that allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions. Amorpha angustifolia is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil fertility."
