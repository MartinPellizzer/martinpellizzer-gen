It is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in clusters, typically pink to red, which bloom in early spring. Its evergreen stems and aromatic leaves make it a distinctive member of the Ericaceae family. Andromeda obtusa thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist woodlands and stream banks."
