    "intro": "Aconitum variegatum var. oenipontanum, commonly known as the Variegated Monkshood, is a striking perennial plant native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like stems that bear large, palmately lobed leaves with distinctive variegation. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers that are highly toxic due to the presence of potent alkaloids. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens, though caution is necessary due to its toxicity.",
