It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, ovate leaves that have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form thick ground cover."
