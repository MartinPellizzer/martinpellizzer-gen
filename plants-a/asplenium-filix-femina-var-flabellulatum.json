    "intro": "Asplenium filix-femina var. flabellulatum, commonly known as the Fan-leaf Fern, is a varietal form of the common maidenhair fern. It is characterized by its delicate, fan-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its graceful appearance. The plant is relatively low maintenance and can be grown both indoors and outdoors in suitable climates."
