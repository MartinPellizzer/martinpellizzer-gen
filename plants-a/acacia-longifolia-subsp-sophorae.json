    "intro": "Acacia longifolia subsp. sophorae, commonly known as the coastal wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and feathery, bipinnate leaves that are grey-green in color. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads that appear in spring, attracting a variety of pollinators. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in dunes and heathlands. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is also cultivated in gardens and for erosion control.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia longifolia subsp. sophorae is primarily native to southern Australia, including the states of Western Australia, South Australia, and Victoria. It is also found in parts of New Zealand, where it has been introduced and naturalized. This subspecies thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often in shrublands and woodland habitats. It is commonly associated with the southern coast of Australia, particularly in the regions of the Great Southern and the Esperance area. Its distribution is largely limited to the temperate and sub-tropical zones of these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia longifolia subsp. sophorae was mainly introduced to coastal and sandy areas of southern Australia, including parts of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. It is commonly found in dunes, heathlands, and along the edges of agricultural areas. This subspecies is well adapted to saline and nutrient-poor soils, which contributes to its successful establishment in these environments. It is often used for stabilizing dunes and as a windbreak due to its hardy nature. However, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
