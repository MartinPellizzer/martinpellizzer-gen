    "intro": "Arceuthobium tsugense subsp. tsugense, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily infests hemlock trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, forming dense clusters on the branches. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that contain seeds dispersed by wind after the fruit bursts. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, leading to the formation of characteristic galls. This subspecies is native to the Pacific Northwest and is an important component of the forest ecosystem."
