It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink. The leaves are typically narrow and have a rough, textured surface, giving the plant its \"scabrid\" designation. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
