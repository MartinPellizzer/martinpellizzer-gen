    "intro": "Artemisia obtusiloba subsp. obtusiloba, commonly known as roughleaf sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage, which is covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in composite flower heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sagebrush steppe and rocky soils. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, which contribute to its ecological and potential medicinal significance."
