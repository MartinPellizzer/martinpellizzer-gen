This variety is found in the southern regions of New Zealand, particularly in the South Island. It typically grows in coastal and subantarctic environments. The plant is adapted to the cool, temperate climate of these areas. It is commonly found in rocky soils and on coastal cliffs.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena microphylla var. pallideolivacea was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems. The plant competes with indigenous species for resources, leading to ecological concerns. Its distribution is now widespread across various regions of New Zealand."
