It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant contains volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its strong medicinal and aromatic properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ecological importance and historical use in traditional medicine, it is a valued plant in both horticulture and herbal practices."
