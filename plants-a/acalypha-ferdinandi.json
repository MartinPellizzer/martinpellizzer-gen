This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. The species is known for its distinctive foliage and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific geographic areas in Central America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha ferdinandi was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in warm, humid environments. It is commonly found in regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia, the Philippines, and Malaysia. The plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its vibrant foliage and unique leaf patterns. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation. Its spread is facilitated by its ability to propagate through both seeds and vegetative means."
