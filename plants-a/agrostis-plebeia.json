    "intro": "Agrostis plebeia, commonly known as common bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and has narrow, flat leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Agrostis plebeia is valued for its ornamental use in landscaping and its role in stabilizing soil in natural habitats."
