    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha amentacea subsp. wilkesiana is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and along riverbanks in these areas. This species thrives in humid, warm climates with high rainfall. It is often associated with secondary growth areas and disturbed habitats. Its native range extends to parts of Oceania, including some islands in the Pacific.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha amentacea subsp. wilkesiana was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value due to its attractive, fluffy seed heads. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a landscape plant because of its vibrant foliage and unique appearance. This species has been introduced to parts of the United States, including Florida and Hawaii, as well as other warm climates around the world. However, it is considered invasive in some areas where it can outcompete native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through wind-dispersed seeds contribute to its success in non-native environments."
