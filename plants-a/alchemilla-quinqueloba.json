    "intro": "Alchemilla quinqueloba, commonly known as five-lobed lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves with five lobes, which are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along streambanks. Alchemilla quinqueloba is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet conditions."
