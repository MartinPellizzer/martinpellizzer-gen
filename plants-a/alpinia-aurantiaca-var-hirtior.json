It is characterized by its striking reddish-pink bracts that surround its small, fragrant flowers. The plant has thick, fleshy rhizomes that store nutrients and water, typical of many ginger species. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a textured appearance. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and aromatic properties."
