    "intro": "Arrhenatherum hirtulum, commonly known as hairy false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. This grass is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
