    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abildgaardia parva is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically the coastal regions of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa. It is commonly found in sandy soils along the coastline, often growing in open, sunny areas. This small plant is adapted to the warm, humid climate of the region and thrives in coastal dune environments. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is known for its delicate, daisy-like flowers. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abildgaardia parva was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was first recorded in the early 20th century as an ornamental plant. The species has since spread across various regions, including parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in forested areas. Due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native species, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
