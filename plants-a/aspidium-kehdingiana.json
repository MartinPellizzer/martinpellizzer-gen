    "intro": "Aspidium kehdingiana, commonly known as the Kehding's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense mats that help stabilize the substrate. The spores are produced in small, clustered sori located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in aquatic habitats."
