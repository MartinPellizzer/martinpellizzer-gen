It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and palmate leaves that turn vibrant yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish flowers in the spring, which are followed by winged seeds called samaras. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Acer molle is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.",
