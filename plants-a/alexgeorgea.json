    "intro": "Alexgeorgea, commonly known as the pink fairy tern, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
