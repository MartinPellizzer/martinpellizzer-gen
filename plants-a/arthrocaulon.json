These plants are characterized by their succulent, often fleshy leaves and stems, which help them store water in arid environments. They are typically found in saline or coastal areas, where they thrive in high-salt conditions. Arthrocaulon species often have small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. The genus includes both annual and perennial species, showcasing a range of growth habits and ecological adaptations."
