    "intro": "Astragalus crispocarpus, commonly known as the roughpod milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers in late spring, followed by distinctive, inflated pods that mature in the summer. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert habitats. Astragalus crispocarpus is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
