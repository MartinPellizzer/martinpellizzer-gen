    "intro": "Agapanthus umbellatus var. minimus, commonly known as the dwarf agapanthus, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to South Africa. It features dense, spherical clusters of striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette at the base. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its smaller size and elegant appearance make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, ornamental plant."
