    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 ticinense, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium ruta-muraria. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium \u00d7 ticinense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
