    "intro": "Adiantum caudatum var. edgeworthii, commonly known as the Edgeworth's maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Adiantum genus. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.",
