    "intro": "Astragalus cruciatus var. radians, commonly known as the radiant milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its compound leaves are pinnately arranged, and the pods are slender and somewhat flattened. This species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
