    "intro": "Aspidium frigidum, commonly known as the cold fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or ascending in growth habit. The plant prefers cool, moist environments, often found in shaded, forested areas with well-drained soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Aspidium frigidum is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
