    "intro": "Adonis aestivalis subsp. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf autumn crocus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking, nodding flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow during late summer to early autumn. The plant's most distinctive characteristic is its unique, helmet-shaped seed capsule that splits open to release its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and natural habitats.",
