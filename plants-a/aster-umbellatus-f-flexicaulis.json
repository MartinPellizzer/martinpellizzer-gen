    "intro": "Aster umbellatus f. flexicaulis, commonly known as the bent-stem aster, is a herbaceous perennial native to the northeastern United States. It features a distinctive, upright growth habit with a flexible, often curved stem that distinguishes it from other aster species. The plant produces clusters of small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white to pale blue, typically blooming in late summer to early fall. Its foliage consists of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
