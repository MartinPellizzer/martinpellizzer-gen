    "intro": "Asplenium procerum var. mishmicum, commonly known as the Mishmi holly fern, is a fern species native to the northeastern regions of India and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its intricate, finely divided fronds that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices, thriving in humid, temperate climates. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, fibrous mat, which helps anchor it to substrates and absorb moisture. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady gardens or as a houseplant."
