    "intro": "Apocynum crassifolium, commonly known as thick-leaved dogbane, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are thick and leathery, often with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in woodland edges or wetlands. Apocynum crassifolium contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to most herbivores."
