    "intro": "Asplenium bodinieri, commonly known as the African maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often display a dark green to blackish coloration. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Asplenium bodinieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
