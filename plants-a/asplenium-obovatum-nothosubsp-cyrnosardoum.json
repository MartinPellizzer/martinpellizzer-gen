    "intro": "Asplenium obovatum nothosubsp. cyrnosardoum, commonly known as the Cyrnosardoum spleenwort, is a fern characterized by its small, obovate-shaped fronds. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a compact growth habit with fertile and sterile fronds that are often closely arranged. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are located on the underside of the leaves. This nothosubspecies is a hybrid form, likely resulting from crosses between different species within the genus Asplenium."
