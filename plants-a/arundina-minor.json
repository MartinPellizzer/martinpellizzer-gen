    "intro": "Arundina minor, commonly known as the dwarf bamboo, is a small, evergreen perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and slender, bamboo-like stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or brown in color. Arundina minor thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread slowly, making it suitable for ground cover in shaded gardens."
