    "intro": "Aconitum lycoctonum var. clusianum, commonly known as the Clusian monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking, helmet-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has large, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.",
