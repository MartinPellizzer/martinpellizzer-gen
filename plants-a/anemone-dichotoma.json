    "intro": "Anemone dichotoma, commonly known as the sea anemone, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like leaves and showy, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance. Anemone dichotoma is a perennial herb that plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh, cold habitats."
