    "intro": "Athyrium sancti-johannis, commonly known as the Saint John's fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often bright green with a waxy texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
