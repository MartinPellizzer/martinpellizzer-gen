    "intro": "Astragalus inoblitus, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and rocky habitats. Astragalus inoblitus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
