    "intro": "Agropyron pectinatum var. puberulum, commonly known as the rough wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are covered with short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is adapted to harsh environments, tolerating cold temperatures and poor soil conditions. This grass is often used for forage and soil stabilization in arid and semi-arid regions."
