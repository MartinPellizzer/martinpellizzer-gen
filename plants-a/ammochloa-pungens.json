    "intro": "Ammochloa pungens, commonly known as the sand grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Ammochloa pungens is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in environments with low moisture availability. Its resilience makes it an important species in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion."
