    "intro": "Arundarbor atra, commonly known as the black willow, is a deciduous tree native to the wetlands and riparian zones of North America. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and slender, drooping branches. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a serrated edge, turning yellow in the fall. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This plant plays an important role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
