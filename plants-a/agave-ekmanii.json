    "intro": "Agave ekmanii, commonly known as the Tule Island agave, is a rare and endemic species native to the Tule Islands in the Gulf of California. It is a succulent plant characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that form a rosette shape. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk with small, white flowers, which bloom only once in its lifetime. Agave ekmanii is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves to survive in dry conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered vulnerable to extinction."
