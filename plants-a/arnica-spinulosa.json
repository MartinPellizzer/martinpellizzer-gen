    "intro": "Arnica spinulosa, commonly known as the spiked arnica, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers in the summer, which are clustered in a spherical shape known as a corymb. Its medicinal properties have been traditionally used for their anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. Arnica spinulosa thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows."
