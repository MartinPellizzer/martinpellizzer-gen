It is a small shrub characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and pale or white on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with two distinct colors, usually white and yellow, which contribute to its common name. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds.
