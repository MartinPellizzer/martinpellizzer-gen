    "intro": "Atriplex lampifer, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its succulent, salt-tolerant leaves that help it thrive in saline soils. The plant belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is known for its ability to accumulate minerals, particularly sodium. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits containing seeds. Atriplex lampifer is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological importance and resilience in harsh environments."
