    "intro": "Althaea cretica, commonly known as the Crimean marshmallow, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale pink or white flowers during the summer months. Its roots contain mucilage, which has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its soothing properties. Althaea cretica thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks."
