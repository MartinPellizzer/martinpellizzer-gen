    "intro": "Anthericum reflexum, commonly known as the nodding onion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or greenish flowers that droop downward on slender stems. The plant is characterized by its underground bulbs, which are edible and have a mild onion flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Anthericum reflexum is also known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some areas."
