    "intro": "Acrostichum flabellatum var. sphenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sword fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf sword fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery fronds that grow in a compact, upright form. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense clumps. Its leaves are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, fan-like appearance in mature fronds. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests and along stream banks.",
