    "intro": "Amygdalus macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf peach or sweet almond, is a species of shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces fragrant white to pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, fuzzy fruits. The fruit contains a single hard-shelled seed, which is the source of the edible almond. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its use in both culinary and medicinal applications."
