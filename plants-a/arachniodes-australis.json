    "intro": "Arachniodes australis, commonly known as the Australian spider fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Australia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lacy fronds that resemble spider webs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to rocky substrates or soil. Arachniodes australis is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light."
