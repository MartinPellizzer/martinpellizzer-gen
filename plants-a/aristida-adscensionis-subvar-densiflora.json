    "intro": "Aristida adscensionis subvar. densiflora, commonly known as the denseflower wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, dense clusters of pale green to golden yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grassy areas. Its dense foliage makes it an important component of native plant communities and a valuable forage resource for wildlife."
