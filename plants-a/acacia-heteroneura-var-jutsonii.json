    "intro": "Acacia heteroneura var. jutsonii, commonly known as the Jutson's wattle, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and bipinnate leaves that are finely divided. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens.",

It is commonly found in the sandy soils of the coastal regions and inland areas of the state. This variety is adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates typical of much of Western Australia. It often grows in shrubland and woodland communities. Its distribution is largely restricted to the southern and western parts of the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia heteroneura var. jutsonii was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a warm, arid climate, typically found in regions of southern Australia. It thrives in full sun and is commonly found in coastal and inland dunes. This variety is known for its distinctive, narrow leaves and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful for soil stabilization. It has been introduced for ornamental purposes and as a potential forage plant in certain agricultural settings. However, its spread is limited due to its specific environmental requirements."
