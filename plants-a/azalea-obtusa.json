It belongs to the Rhododendron genus and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in late spring. Its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant blooms. Azalea obtusa thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
