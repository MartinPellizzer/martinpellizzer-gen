    "intro": "Adiantum tenerum var. rotundatum, commonly known as the round-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that are covered in a layer of fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing clusters called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are typically arranged in a single row along the veins. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, humus-rich soil. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.",
