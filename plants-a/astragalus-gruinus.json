    "intro": "Astragalus gruinus, commonly known as the Gruin's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from lower soil layers. Astragalus gruinus is often found in steppe and desert scrub habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
