    "intro": "Angraecum ambrense, commonly known as the Ambrense orchid, is a species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, long-lasting inflorescences. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. Angraecum ambrense is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
