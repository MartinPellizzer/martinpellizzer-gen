    "intro": "Ajuga multiflora var. multiflora, commonly known as carpet bugle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features a dense mat of dark green, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue to purple flowers in early to mid-summer. It thrives in moist, partially shaded environments and is often found in woodland understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form thick ground covers, making it a valuable plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat."
