    "intro": "Astragalus dignus, commonly known as the noble milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils, often found in desert or steppe environments. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Astragalus dignus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife, though it is not widely cultivated."
