    "intro": "Aspidistra medusa, commonly known as the Medusa aspidistra, is a striking evergreen plant native to southern China. It features broad, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, making it suitable for shaded garden areas or indoor cultivation. Aspidistra medusa is prized for its hardiness and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
