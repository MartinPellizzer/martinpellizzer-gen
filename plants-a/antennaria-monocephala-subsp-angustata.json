    "intro": "Antennaria monocephala subsp. angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
