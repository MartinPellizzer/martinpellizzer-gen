    "intro": "Alchemilla indurata, commonly known as the hardy lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Alchemilla indurata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to tolerate partial shade."
