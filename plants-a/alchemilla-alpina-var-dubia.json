    "intro": "Alchemilla alpina var. dubia, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, fuzzy foliage that resembles a mantle, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Alchemilla alpina var. dubia is often used in rock gardens and alpine gardens due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
