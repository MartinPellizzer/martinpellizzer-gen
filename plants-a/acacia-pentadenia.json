    "intro": "Acacia pentadenia, commonly known as the coastal wattle, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, yellow flowers that appear in globular heads. The plant produces flat, leathery phyllodes that are typically green and have a distinctive, narrow shape. Acacia pentadenia thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often growing in dune environments. It is well adapted to salt-laden winds and is an important component of coastal ecosystems.",

This plant typically grows in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal areas. It is a hardy shrub that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Acacia pentadenia plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia pentadenia was mainly introduced to regions with a warm, dry climate and well-drained soils, particularly in parts of Australia and other areas of the Southern Hemisphere. It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas where it thrives in full sun and has minimal water requirements. This plant is often used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its introduction has been associated with both ornamental and ecological purposes. However, in some regions, it has become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation."
