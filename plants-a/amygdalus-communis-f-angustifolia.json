    "intro": "Amygdalus communis f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf peach. This is a botanical variant of the peach tree, characterized by its narrower leaves compared to the typical species. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to regions of Asia, including China and the Middle East. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in the spring, followed by edible fruits that are similar to common peaches but often have a more intense flavor. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and potential for fruit production."
