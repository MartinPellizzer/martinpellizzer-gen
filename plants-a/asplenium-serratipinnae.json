    "intro": "Asplenium serratipinnae, commonly known as the serrated pinna fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with serrated edges. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense forests. Its rhizomes are often creeping, allowing it to form dense mats in suitable habitats. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
