It is native to Southeast Asia, including regions such as Vietnam and the Philippines. The plants are characterized by their tall, slender stems and feathery, pinnate leaves that give them a graceful appearance. Annamocalamus species are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities. They thrive in humid environments and require well-draining soil for optimal growth."
