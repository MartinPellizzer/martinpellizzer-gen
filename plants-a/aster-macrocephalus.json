    "intro": "Aster macrocephalus, commonly known as the showy aster, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features showy, daisy-like flowers with blue to purple petals that bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant has a sturdy, upright stem that can grow up to 3 feet tall, supporting its large, showy flower heads. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Aster macrocephalus is often found in moist meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
