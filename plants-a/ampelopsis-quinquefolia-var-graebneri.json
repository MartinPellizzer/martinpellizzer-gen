It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive five-leaflet pattern, which gives it its scientific name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its vigorous growth habit and attractive foliage make it suitable for trellises, walls, or as a ground cover."
