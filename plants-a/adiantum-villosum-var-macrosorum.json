    "intro": "Adiantum villosum var. macrosorum, commonly known as the southern maidenhair fern, is a species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble lace, with a distinctive blackish-brown coloration on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of the fronds. This fern is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions.",
