It features dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to tolerate salt spray and sandy soils. It thrives in full sun and is often used in coastal landscaping for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal. Its compact growth habit makes it ideal for rock gardens and as a border plant."
