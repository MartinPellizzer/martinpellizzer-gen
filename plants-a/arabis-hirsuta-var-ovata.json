It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosette of leaves, which help it retain moisture in rocky or arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, typically blooming in early spring. It is native to regions of Europe and western Asia, often found in alpine or coastal habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
