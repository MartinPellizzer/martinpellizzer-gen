    "intro": "Armatocereus cartwrightianus var. longispinus, commonly known as the long-spined night-blooming cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that are covered in sharp, spiny areoles. The plant produces large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and cactus collections."
