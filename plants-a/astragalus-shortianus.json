    "intro": "Astragalus shortianus, commonly known as the short's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus shortianus is part of the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing abilities through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Its botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
