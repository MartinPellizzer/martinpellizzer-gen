    "intro": "Agropyron repens var. altissimum, commonly known as the tall meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, often erect stems. It typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a blue-green coloration that becomes more pronounced in full sun. This variety is notable for its ability to form dense mats, making it a useful plant for erosion control and habitat creation."
