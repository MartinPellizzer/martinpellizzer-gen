The fronds are typically divided into smaller, serrated segments that give the plant its unique appearance. It is native to regions of eastern North America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
