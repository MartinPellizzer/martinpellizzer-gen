This plant grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid environments. It thrives in areas with well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Abutilon calderonii is commonly found in forests and along stream banks in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon calderonii was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions with mild winters and long growing seasons, such as parts of Central and South America. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and showy flowers. It has been introduced to various tropical and subtropical regions as a decorative plant. However, in some areas, it has become invasive, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems."
