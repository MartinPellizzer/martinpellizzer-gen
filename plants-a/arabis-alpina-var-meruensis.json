    "intro": "Arabis alpina var. meruensis, commonly known as the Meru rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of East Africa, particularly Kenya and Tanzania. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous regions. The plant features basal leaves that are oblanceolate and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and are arranged in clusters, blooming in early spring. This variety is notable for its adaptability to harsh alpine environments and its role in local ecosystems."
