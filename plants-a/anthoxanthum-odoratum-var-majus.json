    "intro": "Anthoxanthum odoratum var. majus, commonly known as sweet vernalgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce abundant yellow to orange flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed sites. The plant is also noted for its mild, sweet scent, which is most noticeable when the flowers are in bloom."
