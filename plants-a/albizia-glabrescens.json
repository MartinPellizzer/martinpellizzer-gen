    "intro": "Albizia glabrescens, commonly known as the silky albizia, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It features compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that are covered in a fine, silky texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers clustered in racemes, which bloom during the dry season. Its seeds are encased in flat, elongated pods that split open to release the seeds. Albizia glabrescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
