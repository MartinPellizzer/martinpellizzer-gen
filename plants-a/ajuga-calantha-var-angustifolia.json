    "intro": "Ajuga calantha var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe. It features lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along its stems. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
