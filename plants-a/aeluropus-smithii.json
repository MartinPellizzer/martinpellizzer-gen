    "intro": "Aeluropus smithii, commonly known as coastal grass or saltgrass, is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments. It is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of western and central North America. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with purple or red. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion. Aeluropus smithii is adapted to withstand salt spray and periodic flooding, making it a key component of salt marsh and beach ecosystems."
