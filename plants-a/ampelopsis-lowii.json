    "intro": "Ampelopsis lowii, commonly known as the Chinese ivy, is a woody vine native to eastern Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by blue-black berries. It thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Its climbing habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in moist, temperate climates."
