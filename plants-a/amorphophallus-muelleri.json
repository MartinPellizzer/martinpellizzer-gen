    "intro": "Amorphophallus muelleri, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant's flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a strong, unpleasant odor that attracts pollinators like flies. Its rhizome system allows it to spread rapidly in still water, making it an invasive species in some regions. Botanically, it is classified under the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence structure."
