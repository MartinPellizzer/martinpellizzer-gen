    "intro": "Acronia altimonile, commonly known as the golden spire, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Acronia altimonile is adapted to thrive in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.",
