    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 peltierorum, commonly known as the hybrid shield fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and the presence of small, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a common feature among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. As a hybrid, it exhibits a combination of traits from both parent species, making it an interesting subject for botanical study."
