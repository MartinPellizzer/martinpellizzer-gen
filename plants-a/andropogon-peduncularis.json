    "intro": "Andropogon peduncularis, commonly known as the slender bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soil conditions, often found in marshes, swamps, and along creek banks. The plant features narrow, blue-green blades and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments. Andropogon peduncularis plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining wetland habitats."
