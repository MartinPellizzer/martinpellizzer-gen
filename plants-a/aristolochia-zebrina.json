It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive white and green veining pattern. The plant produces intricate, mottled purple and green flowers that resemble a pipe, which is a key feature of the Aristolochiaceae family. Its foliage and floral structures are adapted for attracting specific pollinators, such as flies and beetles. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
