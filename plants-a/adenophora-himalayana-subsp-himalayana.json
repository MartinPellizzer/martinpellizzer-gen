    "intro": "Adenophora himalayana subsp. himalayana, commonly known as the Himalayan bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, often in rocky or alpine environments, and is adapted to cold, temperate climates. Its leaves are lanceolate and often covered with a fine, hairy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler regions.",
