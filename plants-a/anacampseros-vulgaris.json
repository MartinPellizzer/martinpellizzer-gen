    "intro": "Anacampseros vulgaris, commonly known as the common stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red during the warmer months. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to full sun exposure. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and drought-tolerant landscaping."
