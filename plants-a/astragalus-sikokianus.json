    "intro": "Astragalus sikokianus, commonly known as the Tibetan milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant is adapted to harsh, arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
