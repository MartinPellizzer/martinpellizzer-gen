    "intro": "Aristolochia pierrei, commonly known as the Frenchmandrin, is a climbing vine native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its distinctive, complex, and often aromatic leaves that are heart-shaped with a velvety texture. The plant produces striking, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically purple or greenish in color, which are unique in their structure and often have a strong, unpleasant odor. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
