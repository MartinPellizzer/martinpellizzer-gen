    "intro": "Asplenium tadei, commonly known as the Tadei's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically produces spore-bearing structures called sorocarps, which are clustered at the base of the fronds. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Asplenium tadei is often found growing on rock surfaces or in humid, shaded forest understories."
