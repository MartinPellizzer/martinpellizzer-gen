    "intro": "Apium occidentale, commonly known as wild celery, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, hollow stems and compound leaves with a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, a feature typical of the Apiaceae family. Its roots and leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Apium occidentale thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats."
