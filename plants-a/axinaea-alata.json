    "intro": "Axinaea alata, commonly known as the winged axinaea, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, winged stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by elliptical, edible berries. Axinaea alata is often found in moist, shaded forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal and medicinal properties. Its botanical features make it a unique subject of study in both horticulture and ethnobotany."
