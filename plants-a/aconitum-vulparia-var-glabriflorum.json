    "intro": "Aconitum vulparia var. glabriflorum, commonly known as the smooth-flowered monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue or violet flowers that are arranged in tall, sparsely branched inflorescences. The plant has palmate leaves with deeply cut lobes, and its stems are usually hollow and covered in a fine layer of hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.",
