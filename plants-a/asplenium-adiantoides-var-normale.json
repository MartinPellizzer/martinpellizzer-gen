    "intro": "Asplenium adiantoides var. normale, commonly known as the maidenhair spleenwort, is a fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble the feathery structure of the common maidenhair fern. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The plant is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
