    "intro": "Abies excelsa var. nigra, commonly known as the black fir, is a variant of the silver fir native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark, which gives it its common name. The tree has conical, dense foliage with needle-like leaves that are typically dark green. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies excelsa var. nigra is primarily native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes Mountains in South America. This variety is found in countries such as Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. It typically grows in cloud forests and paramo ecosystems at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,500 meters. The plant thrives in cool, humid climates with well-drained soils. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within these mountain ranges.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies excelsa var. nigra was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and forestry due to its striking dark foliage and potential for timber production. It is valued for its unique appearance, which makes it a desirable species for landscape design. The plant has been cultivated in various regions with temperate climates, including parts of Europe and North America. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in non-native environments. However, it remains primarily a cultivated species with limited naturalization outside its intended habitats."
