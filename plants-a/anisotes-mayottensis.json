    "intro": "Anisotes mayottensis, commonly known as the Mayotte arrowhead, is a rare aquatic plant native to the Comoros Islands. It is characterized by its arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating. The plant has long, slender stems that help it spread across water surfaces. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, making it less noticeable. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
