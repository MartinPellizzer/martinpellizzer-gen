    "intro": "[WRONG START] Astragalus serpentinicus var. esfadiarianianus, commonly known as the Serpentine milkvetch, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of Iran. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and compound leaves. This variant thrives in nutrient-poor, calcareous soils, often found on rocky slopes and serpentine outcrops. Its botanical features include a slender stem, trifoliate leaves, and pods that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species of its unique ecological environment."
