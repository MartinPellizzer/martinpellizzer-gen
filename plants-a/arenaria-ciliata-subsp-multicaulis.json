    "intro": "Arenaria ciliata subsp. multicaulis, commonly known as the hairy sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats with small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny white or pink flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender stems. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, cold climates. Its subspecies, multicaulis, is distinguished by its multiple stems and compact growth habit."
