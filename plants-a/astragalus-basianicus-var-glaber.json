    "intro": "Astragalus basianicus var. glaber, commonly known as the smooth milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and fix nitrogen."
