It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, which float on the surface of water. The plant produces striking, purple flowers that bloom in the evening and emit a strong odor resembling rotting meat. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats and is often found in marshes and ponds. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a notable species in wetland ecosystems."
