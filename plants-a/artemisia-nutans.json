    "intro": "Artemisia nutans, commonly known as nodding wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-green foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that droop downward, giving it its common name. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that mature into small, dry fruits called achene. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine environments. Artemisia nutans is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
