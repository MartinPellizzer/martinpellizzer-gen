    "intro": "Aridaria lignea, commonly known as the desert wood plant, is a shrub adapted to arid environments. It has thick, woody stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are small and often covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pale flowers that attract pollinators like bees and moths. It is native to regions with hot, dry climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
