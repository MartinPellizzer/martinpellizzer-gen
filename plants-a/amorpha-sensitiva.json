    "intro": "Amorpha sensitiva, commonly known as sensitive plant or touch-me-not, is a herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is notable for its rapid leaf closure in response to touch, light, or temperature changes, a reaction mediated by turgor pressure shifts in its leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Amorpha sensitiva is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing abilities, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
