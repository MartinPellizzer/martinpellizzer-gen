It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in open woodlands, grasslands, and along riverbanks. This variant is known for its distinctive leaf shape, resembling that of the birch tree, which gives it its specific epithet \"betulifolius.\" It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and potential medicinal uses. The plant's natural range extends across parts of Africa and the Middle East as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus moschatus var. betulifolius was mainly introduced to regions with warm climates and well-drained soils, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical environments. It is commonly found in parts of Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean, where it has been cultivated for its edible seeds and ornamental value. The plant's introduction has been driven by both agricultural interests and its adaptability to diverse growing conditions. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of oil due to its high lipid content. However, its spread has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in non-native habitats."
