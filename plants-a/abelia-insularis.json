    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelia insularis is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of the Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia. This plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests. It is well adapted to the warm, moist conditions typical of these regions. Abelia insularis is often seen growing in shaded undergrowth or along riverbanks. Its natural habitat reflects its preference for rich, well-drained soils and consistent moisture.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia insularis was mainly introduced to coastal areas and disturbed sites in the southeastern United States. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions. This plant is often found in sandy or rocky habitats, where it can establish itself quickly. Due to its ornamental value, it has been planted in gardens and landscapes across its range. However, it is considered invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
