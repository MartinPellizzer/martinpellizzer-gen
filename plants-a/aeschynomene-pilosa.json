    "intro": "Aeschynomene pilosa, commonly known as hairy gobernadora, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems covered in fine hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a hairy texture. Aeschynomene pilosa is known for its adaptability to various soil types and is sometimes used in phytoremediation due to its ability to tolerate heavy metals."
