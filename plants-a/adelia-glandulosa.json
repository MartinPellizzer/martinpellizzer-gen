    "intro": "Adelia glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular adelia, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.",
