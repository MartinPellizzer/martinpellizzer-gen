    "intro": "Arenaria roseotincta, commonly known as the pink sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky and sandy habitats of northern North America. It features dense clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its root system is typically shallow, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Arenaria roseotincta is often found in alpine and coastal regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
