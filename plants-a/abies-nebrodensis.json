It plays an important role in the local ecosystems and is a symbol of the island's biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies nebrodensis was mainly introduced to specific regions in Europe, particularly in the Alps and surrounding mountainous areas. It was introduced as a ornamental species due to its attractive cone and foliage. The distribution is limited to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils. It has been planted in botanical gardens and private collections across several countries. However, its natural range remains restricted and it is not widely established in the wild."
