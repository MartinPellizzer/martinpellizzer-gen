    "intro": "Avena flavescens, commonly known as yellow oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and riverbanks. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, and its leaves are narrow with a bluish-green hue. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing yellowish to golden florets. Avena flavescens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
