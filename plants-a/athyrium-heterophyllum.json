    "intro": "Athyrium heterophyllum, commonly known as the Japanese painted fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and sometimes pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
