    "intro": "Anthospermum littoreum, commonly known as sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shorelines and in wetlands. Its ability to tolerate salt spray makes it a common sight in coastal ecosystems. Anthospermum littoreum plays a role in stabilizing dune environments and providing habitat for small insects and birds."
