    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon myrianthum is primarily native to Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. This plant is commonly found in the Andean region of South America. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded or semi-shaded areas. It is typically found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in forest understories. The species is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon myrianthum was mainly introduced to areas with warm climates and well-drained soils, often as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. It has been reported in parts of the United States, particularly in southern states like Florida and Texas. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction have led to its establishment in some regions. However, it is not considered invasive in most areas where it is introduced."
