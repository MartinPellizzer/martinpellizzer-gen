It features dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has silvery-green foliage with a fuzzy texture, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
