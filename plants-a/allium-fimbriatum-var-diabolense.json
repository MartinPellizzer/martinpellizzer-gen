    "intro": "Allium fimbriatum var. diabolense, commonly known as the devil's garlic, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces bulbous structures that are often mistaken for true garlic bulbs, though they are botanically distinct. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its common name reflects its pungent odor and the belief that it was used in medieval times to ward off evil spirits."
