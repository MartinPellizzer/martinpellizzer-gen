    "intro": "Asplenium adnatum, commonly known as the maidenhair spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, glossy appearance. The plant's sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. It is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in temperate regions. Asplenium adnatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
