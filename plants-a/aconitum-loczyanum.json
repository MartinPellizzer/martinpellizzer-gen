    "intro": "Aconitum loczyanum, commonly known as the Loczyan monkshood, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant is characterized by its striking purple-blue flowers, which are clustered in a helmet-like structure at the top of tall, erect stems. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. Aconitum loczyanum contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous to humans and animals if ingested.",
