    "intro": "Aster concolor var. devestitus, commonly known as the nakedleaf aster, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its reduced foliage, with leaves that are often small, linear, and sometimes absent, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in the fall, which are clustered in composite flower heads. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and marshes. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
