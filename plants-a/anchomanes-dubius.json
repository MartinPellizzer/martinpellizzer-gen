    "intro": "Anchomanes dubius, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through its white, fleshy stems. The plant produces showy, pale green or white flowers that bloom in the summer. It thrives in wet, swampy habitats and is often found growing on the roots of trees or in dense vegetation. Due to its habitat specificity and declining populations, Anchomanes dubius is considered endangered in many regions."
