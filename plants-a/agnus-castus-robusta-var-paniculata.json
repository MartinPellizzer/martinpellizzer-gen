    "intro": "Agnus-castus robusta var. paniculata, commonly known as the panicled agnus castus, is a variant of the chaste tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces panicles of white to pale pink flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release the seeds."
