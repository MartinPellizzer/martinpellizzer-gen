    "intro": "Antennaria peramoena, commonly known as the sticky weed or mouse ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features dense clusters of tiny, pale yellow to white flowers atop hairy, prostrate stems. Its leaves are typically spoon-shaped and covered in fine, sticky hairs, which help in trapping small insects. Antennaria peramoena thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
