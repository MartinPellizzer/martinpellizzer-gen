    "intro": "Astragalus sufianicus, commonly known as the Sufian milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its ecological significance lies in its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions."
