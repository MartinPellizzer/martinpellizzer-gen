    "intro": "Agrostis subspicata, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features fine, grass-like leaves and produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity. Agrostis subspicata is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
