    "intro": "Armeria douglasii, commonly known as Douglas's thrift, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or alpine environments. It produces basal leaves that are linear and covered in fine hairs, and its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer. Armeria douglasii is well adapted to harsh conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
