    "intro": "Androsace adfinis var. parcedentata, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white to pale green hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or purple flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its botanical features make it a characteristic species of alpine meadows and scree slopes."
