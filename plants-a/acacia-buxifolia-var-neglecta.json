    "intro": "Acacia buxifolia var. neglecta, commonly known as the dwarf acacia or coastal acacia, is a small, evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and small, yellow, spherical flowers that appear in clusters. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray, making it well-suited for coastal environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for landscaping in arid and semi-arid climates. The leaves are typically arranged in a compact, bushy form, contributing to its distinctive appearance.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia buxifolia var. neglecta is primarily native to the eastern coast of Australia, specifically Queensland and New South Wales. It is commonly found in coastal sand dunes and rocky outcrops along the shoreline. This variety thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh coastal environment. It is often seen in areas with high salinity and strong winds. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and locally endemic species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia buxifolia var. neglecta was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature. However, it has since become naturalized and is now considered a potential weed in certain regions. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can spread rapidly in disturbed areas. Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems."
