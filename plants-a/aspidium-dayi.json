    "intro": "Aspidium dayi, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically borne on long, creeping rhizomes. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions of China. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium dayi is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in Chinese herbal medicine."
