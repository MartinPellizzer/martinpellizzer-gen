    "intro": "Acer caudatifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves that are typically 10\u201320 cm in length. The leaves are usually doubly serrated and have a bright green upper surface with a lighter underside. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that disperse by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.",

This species is commonly seen in forested areas and along streamside habitats. Its native range is limited to Taiwan, where it plays a role in local ecosystems. The plant is well adapted to the specific environmental conditions of its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer caudatifolium was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils, particularly in mountainous areas. It thrives in areas with moderate rainfall and full sun exposure. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and unique leaf shape. It has been introduced to several parts of Europe and North America as a landscape plant. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems."
