    "intro": "Aspidium exaltatum, commonly known as the tall water fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are usually pinnately compound and have a distinctive, upright growth form. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium exaltatum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various small organisms in its native ecosystems."
