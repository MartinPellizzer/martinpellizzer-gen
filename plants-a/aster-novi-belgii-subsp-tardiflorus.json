    "intro": "Aster novi-belgii subsp. tardiflorus, commonly known as the late-flowering New Belgium aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom later in the season compared to other aster species. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and gray-green in color. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators in late summer and early fall."
