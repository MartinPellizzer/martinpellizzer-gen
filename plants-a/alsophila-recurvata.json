    "intro": "Alsophila recurvata, commonly known as the recurved tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate fronds that curve backward, giving it its common name. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and swamps. Its rhizome system allows it to anchor firmly in the soil while supporting its tall structure. The fronds are typically dark green and can grow up to several meters in length, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
