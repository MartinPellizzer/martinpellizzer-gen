This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It thrives in humid climates and is often associated with disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands. The species is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive foliage. Its native range spans a significant portion of Central America and parts of southern Mexico.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha langiana var. langiana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It was popular in landscaping and garden settings for its vibrant leaves and ease of cultivation. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native plants and altering local ecosystems. Its introduction was unintentional, likely through seed dispersal by birds or human activity. Efforts are now being made to control its spread and mitigate its impact on native biodiversity."
