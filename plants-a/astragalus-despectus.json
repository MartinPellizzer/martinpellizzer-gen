    "intro": "Astragalus despectus, commonly known as the bentstem milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, often curved stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Astragalus despectus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
