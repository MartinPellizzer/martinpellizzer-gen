It features compound leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length, with a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbels, followed by dark purple berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage and unique, spiky fruit clusters."
