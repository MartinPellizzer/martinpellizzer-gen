    "intro": "Aeonium \u00d7 bornmuelleri, commonly known as the Ghost Plant, is a hybrid succulent native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and striking, translucent green foliage that resembles ghostly apparitions. The plant features fleshy, blue-green leaves with a waxy texture, and it produces vibrant orange or red flowers in spring. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant."
