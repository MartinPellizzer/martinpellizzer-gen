It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. It typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing delicate, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This plant prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and borders."
