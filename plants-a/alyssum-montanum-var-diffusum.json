    "intro": "Alyssum montanum var. diffusum, commonly known as spreading alpine alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage with hairy leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to drought-tolerant landscapes."
