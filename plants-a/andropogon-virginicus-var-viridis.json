    "intro": "Andropogon virginicus var. viridis, commonly known as green bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the eastern and central United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of 1 to 3 meters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually a vibrant green, and its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense stands. This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its adaptability and ecological benefits."
