    "intro": "Andropogon chrysocomus, commonly known as golden bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with a golden hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in prairie and woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is often used in native plant gardens and restoration projects."
