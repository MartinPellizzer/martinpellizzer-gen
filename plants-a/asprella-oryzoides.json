It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in moist, open habitats such as fields and wetlands. Due to its delicate structure and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
