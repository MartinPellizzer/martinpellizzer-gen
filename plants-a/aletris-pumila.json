    "intro": "Aletris pumila, commonly known as the little grass-of-Parnassus, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green and have a slightly textured surface. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Aletris pumila thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded woodland environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, ground-covering mats."
