    "intro": "Astragalus wachschi, commonly known as the waxleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and compound leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow to reddish-purple flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to thrive in dry, rocky soils. Astragalus wachschi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in arid gardens for its hardiness and unique foliage."
