    "intro": "Athyrium cuspidatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved male fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern Asia. It features delicate, bipinnate leaves that are typically dark green and have a finely toothed margin. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in temperate climates."
