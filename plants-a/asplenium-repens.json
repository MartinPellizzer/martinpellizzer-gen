    "intro": "Asplenium repens, commonly known as the running spleenwort, is a small, mat-forming fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread along the ground. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. It is often found growing on rocks, walls, or in damp soil, making it a common epiphyte or lithophyte. Its simple structure and ability to colonize various substrates make it an important component of moist forest ecosystems."
