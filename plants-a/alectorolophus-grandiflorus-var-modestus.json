    "intro": "Alectorolophus grandiflorus var. modestus, commonly known as the modest dwarf orchid, is a compact, terrestrial orchid native to the humid lowland forests of Southeast Asia. It features slender, erect stems with a few broad, ovate leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers with a subtle fragrance, typically blooming during the summer months. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the rich, organic soil in its natural habitat. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
