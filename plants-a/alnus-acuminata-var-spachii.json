    "intro": "Alnus acuminata var. spachii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers that appear in catkins. The plant is typically found in moist, temperate climates, often growing near water sources such as streams and wetlands. It has a shallow root system that can help stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. The tree produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats."
