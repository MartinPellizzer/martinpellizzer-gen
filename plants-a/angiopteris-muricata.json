    "intro": "Angiopteris muricata, commonly known as the humped shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often adorned with a distinctive hump or ridge along the midrib. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Angiopteris muricata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
