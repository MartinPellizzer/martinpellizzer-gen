    "intro": "Archidendron oblongum, commonly known as the broadleaf legume or broadleaf acacia, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with oval to lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, rounded clusters, followed by elongated, woody pods that contain flat, seed-like structures. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Archidendron oblongum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local medicine and as a source of timber."
