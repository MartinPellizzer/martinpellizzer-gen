    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches long. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources. The tree has a shallow root system, making it adaptable to a variety of wetland environments."
