    "intro": "Allobium, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It is characterized by its striking, waxy, often colorful leaves and spadices, which are modified leaves that enclose the flowers. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America. Allobium species typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
