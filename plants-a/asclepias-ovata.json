    "intro": "Asclepias ovata, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy and have a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers with distinctive, hooked seed pods that mature into fluffy, white seeds. Asclepias ovata is a vital host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and supports a variety of pollinators. Its latex sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals but beneficial for certain insect species."
