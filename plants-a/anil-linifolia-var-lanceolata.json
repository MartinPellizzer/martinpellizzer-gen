    "intro": "Anil linifolia var. lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf anil, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil. The plant is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of forage for livestock."
