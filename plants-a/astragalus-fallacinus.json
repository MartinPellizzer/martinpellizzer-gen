    "intro": "Astragalus fallacinus, commonly known as the yellow milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in a fine layer of soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Astragalus fallacinus is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in arid environments."
