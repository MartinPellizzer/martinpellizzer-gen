    "intro": "Armeriastrum iconicum, commonly known as the coastal fairybells, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy bloom. Armeriastrum iconicum is well adapted to coastal climates, tolerating salt spray and strong winds."
