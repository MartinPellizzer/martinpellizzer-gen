    "intro": "Austromyrtus opaca, commonly known as the Narrow-leaved Myrtletree, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes eucalypts and other aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters. Austromyrtus opaca is often found in coastal and sandy soils, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for native wildlife. Its aromatic foliage and resilience to coastal conditions make it a notable species in its native range."
