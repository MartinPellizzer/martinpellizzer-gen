    "intro": "Aconitum delphiniifolium var. pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf delphiniifolium aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking blue to purple flowers arranged in dense, spikelike clusters, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are finely divided, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and toxic properties, it is often cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling.",
