    "intro": "Aerobion maculatum, commonly known as the spotted bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland environments. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap aquatic prey. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-poor waters where it supplements its nutrient intake by digesting insects. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems rise above the water surface. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in stagnant water and its unique adaptation for nutrient acquisition."
