    "intro": "Acacia rostrata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, linear leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical clusters, which are typically followed by long, slender pods. Acacia rostrata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought resistance and a capacity for resprouting after fire. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia rostrata is primarily native to northern Australia, including the Northern Territory, Western Australia, and Queensland. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in sandy soils. This species thrives in open woodlands and shrublands, often growing along riverbanks and in coastal areas. It is well adapted to the harsh climate with its deep root system and water-storing capabilities. Acacia rostrata plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia rostrata was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the northern and western parts, as well as in parts of Southeast Asia. This plant is often used for its hardy nature and ability to provide shade and habitat for wildlife. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain environments. Despite this, it remains an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
