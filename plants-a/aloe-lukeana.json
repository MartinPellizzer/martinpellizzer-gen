    "intro": "Aloe lukeana, commonly known as the mountain aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences with yellow flowers, which bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Aloe lukeana is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
