    "intro": "Aspidium laeve, commonly known as the smooth water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually bright green and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. Aspidium laeve is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
