    "intro": "Anthurium cuyabenoense, commonly known as the Cuyabeno anthurium, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped spathe that comes in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers inside a spadix, which is typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
