    "intro": "Ampelopsis, commonly known as the grape ivy, is a genus of flowering plants in the Vitaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed. The plants produce small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. Ampelopsis species are native to Asia, North America, and parts of Europe, and they thrive in moist, shaded environments. They are often used in landscaping for their ornamental value and ability to climb or trail along structures."
