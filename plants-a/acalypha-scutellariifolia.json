    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha scutellariifolia is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is also found in parts of tropical regions in Africa, such as Kenya and Tanzania. This plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland areas with rich soil. It is commonly seen in wetlands, forest edges, and disturbed habitats. Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to warm, moist environments across these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha scutellariifolia was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and as a potential medicinal plant. It is commonly cultivated for its attractive foliage and is used in landscaping and garden design. The plant has been introduced to several tropical and subtropical regions around the world. It is valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to partial shade. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas where it can outcompete native vegetation."
