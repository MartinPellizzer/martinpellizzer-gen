    "intro": "Aspidium rochaleanum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bioluminescent under certain conditions. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocks or in forest undergrowth. Its spores are dispersed through the wind, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively. Aspidium rochaleanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
