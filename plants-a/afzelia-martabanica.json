    "intro": "Afzelia martabanica, commonly known as the Martaban ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The tree has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in humid climates and is often found in lowland and hill forest ecosystems. Due to its slow growth and limited natural range, it is considered a valuable but endangered species."
