    "intro": "Astragalus compositus, commonly known as the composite milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Astragalus compositus is often found in prairies, steppe habitats, and disturbed areas. Its seeds are small and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
