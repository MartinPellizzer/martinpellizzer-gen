    "intro": "Asplenium radicans var. longedecurrens, commonly known as the creeping spleenwort, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the ground or over surfaces such as rocks and tree trunks. The leaves are typically slender and elongated, with a delicate, feathery appearance, and they often form dense mats. This variety is distinguished by its long, recurved leaflets that give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or on shaded rock faces."
