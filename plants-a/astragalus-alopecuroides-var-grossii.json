    "intro": "Astragalus alopecuroides var. grossii, commonly known as the rough-hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It is adapted to thrive in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in steppe and rocky habitats. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and supporting pollinators in its native range."
