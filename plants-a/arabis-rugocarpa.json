    "intro": "Arabis rugocarpa, commonly known as the roughleaf rockcress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, wrinkled leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to regions of Europe and Asia, this species thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or coastal habitats. The plant's small, capsule-like fruits contain numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant."
