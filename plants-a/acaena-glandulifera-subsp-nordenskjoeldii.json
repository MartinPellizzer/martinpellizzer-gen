    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena glandulifera subsp. nordenskjoeldii is primarily native to southern South America, specifically Chile and Argentina. It is commonly found in the temperate regions of these countries, particularly in the Andes mountain range. This subspecies thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often seen in grasslands and shrublands. It is well adapted to the climate and soil conditions of its native range. The plant is an important component of the local flora and is often found in association with other native species in its ecosystem.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena glandulifera subsp. nordenskjoeldii was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the 19th century. The plant is now considered an invasive species in certain regions of New Zealand. It thrives in disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation. Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems."
