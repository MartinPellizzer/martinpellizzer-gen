    "intro": "Apocynum \u00d7 convallarium, commonly known as hybrid yellow oleander, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Apocynum cannabinum (dogbane) and Convallaria majalis (lily of the valley). It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that range from white to pink. The plant produces berries that are toxic to humans and animals, containing cardiac glycosides. It is often found in moist, wooded areas and is cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its toxicity, it requires careful handling and is not recommended for use in gardens with children or pets."
