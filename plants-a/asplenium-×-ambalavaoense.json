    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 ambalavaoense, commonly known as the Ambalavao spleenwort, is a hybrid fern native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves that are often clustered at the base. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a short, creeping rhizome and small, fertile fronds that produce spores. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
