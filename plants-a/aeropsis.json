    "intro": "Aeropsis, commonly known as the air plant, is a type of epiphytic plant that thrives without soil, absorbing moisture and nutrients through its leaves. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plant's rosette-shaped leaves are adapted to capture and store water, which is essential for its survival in humid environments. Aeropsis species often have vibrant, colorful inflorescences that bloom from the center of the rosette. These plants are popular as houseplants due to their low maintenance and unique appearance."
