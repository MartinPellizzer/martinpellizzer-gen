    "intro": "Anthemis coronopifolia, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets. It is often used in landscaping for erosion control due to its vigorous growth and ability to thrive in poor soils. The plant also has a long history of use in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
