    "intro": "Alchemilla bogumilii, commonly known as the bog alumroot, is a perennial herb native to central and eastern Europe. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. The plant features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, silky white down. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in late spring to early summer, forming dense clusters at the ends of the stems. Alchemilla bogumilii is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
