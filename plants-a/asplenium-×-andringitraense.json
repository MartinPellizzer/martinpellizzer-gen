    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 andringitraense, commonly known as the Andringitra spleenwort, is a hybrid fern species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lobed fronds that often exhibit a variegated appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
