It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that are often covered in hooked bristles, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. It thrives in dry, arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects.",
