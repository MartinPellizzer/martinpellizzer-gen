    "intro": "Aplectrum spicatum, commonly known as the common twayblade, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the orchid family (Orchidaceae). It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its unique inflorescence of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. It lacks true leaves and instead relies on its rhizomes for photosynthesis. Aplectrum spicatum is a non-photosynthetic orchid, meaning it forms symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi to obtain nutrients."
