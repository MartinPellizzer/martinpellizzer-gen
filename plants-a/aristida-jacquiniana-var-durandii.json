It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spiky inflorescences composed of dense clusters of spikelets. Its flowering period usually occurs during the warmer months, and it is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
