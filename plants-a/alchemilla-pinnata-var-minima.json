    "intro": "Alchemilla pinnata var. minima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that form a dense mat, often covered in a silvery bloom. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender stalks. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and ability to tolerate wet conditions."
