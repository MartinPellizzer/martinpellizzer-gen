    "intro": "Amoria repens, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, sprawling stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine pubescence. Amoria repens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks."
