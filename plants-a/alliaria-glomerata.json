    "intro": "Alliaria glomerata, commonly known as stink cabbage, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other mustard plants. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by round, green pods containing seeds. Its leaves are broad and oval, often with a slightly rough texture. Alliaria glomerata is known for its strong, pungent odor, which becomes more pronounced when the plant is damaged or crushed."
