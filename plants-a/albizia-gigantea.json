    "intro": "Albizia gigantea, commonly known as the giant silktree, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate leaves that turn a striking red or orange color before falling in the dry season. The tree produces fragrant, yellow or white pea-like flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its pods are long and flat, containing several seeds that are dispersed by wind. Albizia gigantea is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often planted in gardens and along roadsides for its aesthetic appeal."
