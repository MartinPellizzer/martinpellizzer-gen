It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and segmented stems. The plant typically forms dense mats of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
