    "intro": "Ajuga glabrifolia, commonly known as carpet bugle or smoothleaf ajuga, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features a dense mat of heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a smooth texture. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple during the spring. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in woodland gardens for its ornamental value. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form thick ground cover."
