    "intro": "Alopecurus antarcticus var. brachyatherus, commonly known as the Antarctic meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Southern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with inconspicuous flowers, which are adapted to pollination by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subantarctic regions. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
