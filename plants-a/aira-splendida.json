    "intro": "Aira splendida, commonly known as the golden airplant, is a member of the grass family Poaceae. It is native to the southern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms a tufted growth habit. Its leaves are typically narrow, linear, and covered in fine, silky hairs. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked, but it is prized for its ornamental value in native gardens."
