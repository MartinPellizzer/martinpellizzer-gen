    "intro": "Asteriscus pinifolius, commonly known as the needleleaf asteriscus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, needle-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, yellow to white flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Asteriscus pinifolius is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
