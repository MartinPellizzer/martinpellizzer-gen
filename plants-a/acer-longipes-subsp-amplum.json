    "intro": "Acer longipes subsp. amplum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its broad, palmately lobed leaves that are typically green in summer and turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds known as samaras. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found at high elevations. Its botanical features make it an important species in the study of temperate forest ecosystems.",
