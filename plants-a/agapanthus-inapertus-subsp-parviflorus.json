    "intro": "Agapanthus inapertus subsp. parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered agapanthus, is a striking South African plant characterized by its dense, spherical inflorescences. It produces clusters of blue to purple tubular flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant features broad, strap-like leaves that are dark green and often have a waxy coating. It is well-suited for cultivation in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental in gardens. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its native arid environment, with efficient water retention mechanisms."
