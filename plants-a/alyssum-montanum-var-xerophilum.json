    "intro": "Alyssum montanum var. xerophilum, commonly known as the desert alyssum, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring and early summer. The plant has compact, succulent-like leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It is well adapted to rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its drought tolerance makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
