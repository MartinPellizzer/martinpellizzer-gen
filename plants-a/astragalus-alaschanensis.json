    "intro": "Astragalus alaschanensis, commonly known as the Alaschan milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus alaschanensis is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators."
