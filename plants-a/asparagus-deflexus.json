    "intro": "Asparagus deflexus, commonly known as the drooping asparagus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features slender, arching stems that often grow close to the ground, with small, fern-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils. Asparagus deflexus is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, where it contributes to the local biodiversity."
