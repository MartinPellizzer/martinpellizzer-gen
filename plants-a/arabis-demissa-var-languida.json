It typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, elongated, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. This variety is noted for its delicate, cascading growth habit, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
