    "intro": "Athyrium supranigrescens, commonly known as the dark-leaved chain fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its elegant, pinnate fronds with a dark, almost blackish hue on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it produces spores rather than seeds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady garden settings."
