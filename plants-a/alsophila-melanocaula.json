    "intro": "Alsophila melanocaula, commonly known as the black-stemmed tree fern, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a dark, leathery rind that gives it its common name. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that grow in a spiral pattern around the trunk. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Alsophila melanocaula plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various forest organisms."
