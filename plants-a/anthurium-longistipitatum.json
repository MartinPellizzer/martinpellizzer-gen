It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces vibrant red spadix surrounded by a showy, white to green spathe, which is typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Anthurium longistipitatum is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and unique flowering structure."
