    "intro": "Anomatheca verrucosa, commonly known as the roughleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features a dense rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in small, wart-like bumps, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Its succulent leaves are adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. Anomatheca verrucosa is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
