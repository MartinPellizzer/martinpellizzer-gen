    "intro": "Aconitum lycoctonum f. bracteatum, commonly known as the bracted monkshood, is a variant of the monkshood plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its striking purple to blue flowers arranged in a spire-like inflorescence. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veining pattern, and its stems are typically green with a slight purplish tinge. The bracted form is distinguished by the presence of modified leaves, or bracts, at the base of the flower cluster. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.",
