    "intro": "Alseis reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined alseis, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a distinctive reticulate venation pattern. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by edible berries that are typically red or black in color. Alseis reticulata thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and small mammals."
