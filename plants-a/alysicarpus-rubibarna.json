    "intro": "Alysicarpus rubibarna, commonly known as red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a fibrous, woody pulp. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used in construction and crafting. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
