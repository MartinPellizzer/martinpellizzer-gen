    "intro": "Agrostis pusilla, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like turf and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, lawns, and along streambanks. The plant has fine, slender leaves that are usually less than 2 inches in length, and its inflorescence consists of clusters of small, spikelet-like flowers. Agrostis pusilla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in shaded conditions make it a resilient and adaptable species."
