    "intro": "Asplenium scolopendrium subsp. japonicum, commonly known as the Japanese maidenhair fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a feathery appearance. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
