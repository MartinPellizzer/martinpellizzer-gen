    "intro": "Athyrium crenulatum, commonly known as the notched lady fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often adorned with finely toothed margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, aiding in its establishment in suitable habitats. Athyrium crenulatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
