    "intro": "Antennaria occidentalis, commonly known as the western mouse-eared chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of white flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or coastal environments. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Antennaria occidentalis is adapted to harsh conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
