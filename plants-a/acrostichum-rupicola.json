    "intro": "Acrostichum rupicola, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that arise from a creeping rhizome. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Acrostichum rupicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings.",
