    "intro": "Aleuritopteris kuhnii f. efarinosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the forest floor. The fronds are usually harvested for ornamental purposes due to their aesthetic appeal."
