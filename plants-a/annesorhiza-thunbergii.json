    "intro": "Annesorhiza thunbergii, commonly known as the Japanese anemone, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia. It features showy, white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has a rhizomatous root system, allowing it to spread and form colonies in moist, shady environments. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a soft, hairy texture, and it thrives in woodland or streamside habitats. Annesorhiza thunbergii is valued in gardens for its ornamental flowers and ability to attract pollinators."
