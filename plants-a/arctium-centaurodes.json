    "intro": "Arctium centaurodes, commonly known as the hairy burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant produces large, spiky, brownish-purple burrs that enclose small seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a rough, hairy texture, and it thrives in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. Arctium centaurodes is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
