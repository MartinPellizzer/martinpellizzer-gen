    "intro": "Agropyron repens subsp. pseudocaesium, commonly known as the creeping wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous growth habit. It typically forms dense mats on the ground, which helps in soil stabilization and erosion control. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with florets. It is native to temperate regions of Europe and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. Its botanical features make it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
