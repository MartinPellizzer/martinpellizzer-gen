    "intro": "Apogon humilis var. lyratus, commonly known as the lyrate apogon, is a perennial herb native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, lyrate-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a terminal inflorescence, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. Its flowering period generally occurs during the warm seasons, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
