    "intro": "Alsophila leschenaultiana, commonly known as the Leschenault's tree fern, is a tropical species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the rachis. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. The spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
