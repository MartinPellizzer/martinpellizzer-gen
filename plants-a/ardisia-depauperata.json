    "intro": "Ardisia depauperata, commonly known as the poorleaf ardisia, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Ardisia depauperata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and compact growth habit."
