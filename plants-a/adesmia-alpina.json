    "intro": "Adesmia alpina, commonly known as the alpine legume, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes and beans, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as the Andes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its small, clustered flowers are often pink or purple, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Adesmia alpina is valued for its ecological importance in mountain ecosystems and its potential use in sustainable agriculture.",
