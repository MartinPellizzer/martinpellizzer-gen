    "intro": "Astragalus montivagus, commonly known as the mountain milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in rocky and arid environments. Astragalus montivagus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinators. It is also valued in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
