    "intro": "Amelanchier diversifolia, commonly known as the Allegheny serviceberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its oval to ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that ripen in late summer. Its bark is smooth and gray, with a tendency to develop shallow fissures as the plant matures. Amelanchier diversifolia is often found in woodland areas and thrives in partial shade to full sun."
