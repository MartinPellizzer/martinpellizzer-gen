    "intro": "Ameletia floribunda, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with hairy undersides, and its stems are often hairy as well. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or woodland borders. Ameletia floribunda is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
