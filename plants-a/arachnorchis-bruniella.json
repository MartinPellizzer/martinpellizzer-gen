    "intro": "Arachnorchis bruniella, commonly known as the Bruny Island spider orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid native to Tasmania. It is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understoreys. It has a short, hairy stem and produces pale green or white flowers with a distinct, fragrant scent. Due to its limited habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
