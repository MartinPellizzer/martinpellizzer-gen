    "intro": "Armeria maritima var. bigerrensis, commonly known as the coastal thrift or sea thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and harsh maritime conditions. The plant features dense clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, gray-green leaves that are succulent and adapted to reduce water loss. This variety is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
