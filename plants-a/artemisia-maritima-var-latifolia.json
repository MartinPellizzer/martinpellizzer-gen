    "intro": "Artemisia maritima var. latifolia, commonly known as sea wormwood, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in dune environments or along the edges of salt marshes. Its adaptability to coastal conditions makes it an important component of maritime ecosystems."
