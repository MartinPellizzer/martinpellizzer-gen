    "intro": "Andropogon verticillatus, commonly known as basket grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often rolled in a spiral at the base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green or purplish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Basket grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
