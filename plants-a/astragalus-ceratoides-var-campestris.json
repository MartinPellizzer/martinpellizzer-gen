    "intro": "Astragalus ceratoides var. campestris, commonly known as the field milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
