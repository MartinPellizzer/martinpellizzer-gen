    "intro": "Anthurium \u00d7 houletianum, commonly known as the flamingo flower, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Araceae family. It is characterized by its vibrant, brightly colored spathe that resembles a flower, though it is actually a modified leaf. The plant's inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by the showy spathe, which is often used in ornamental horticulture. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires indirect light to flourish. Anthurium \u00d7 houletianum is prized for its long-lasting, colorful bracts that can last several weeks."
