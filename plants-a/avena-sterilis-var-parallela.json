    "intro": "Avena sterilis var. parallela, commonly known as the parallel-awned oat, is a grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with short, parallel awns, which are bristle-like structures at the base of the florets. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in grasslands or along stream banks. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for erosion control."
