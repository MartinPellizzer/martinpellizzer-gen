    "intro": "Alectra abyssinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It belongs to the family Pedaliaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant thrives in arid or semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Alectra abyssinica is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional African medicine."
