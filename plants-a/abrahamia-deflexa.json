    "intro": "Abrahamia deflexa, commonly known as the flexible Abrahamia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant produces small, bell-shaped blooms that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Abrahamia deflexa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering display.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abrahamia deflexa is primarily native to Madagascar. This unique plant is found in the diverse ecosystems of the island, including dry and moist forests. It is adapted to the specific climatic and soil conditions of Madagascar. The species is endemic to the region, meaning it is not found anywhere else in the world. Its native distribution highlights the island's rich biodiversity and ecological significance.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrahamia deflexa was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas. It thrives in environments with full sun and moderate to dry conditions. The plant spreads primarily through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to concerns about ecological impact in areas where it has become established."
