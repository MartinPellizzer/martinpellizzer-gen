    "intro": "Ajuga vulgaris var. breviproles, commonly known as carpet bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, ovate leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it a popular choice for ground cover in gardens."
