    "intro": "Androsace olympica, commonly known as the Olympic mouse-eared cress, is a low-growing alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Androsace olympica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
