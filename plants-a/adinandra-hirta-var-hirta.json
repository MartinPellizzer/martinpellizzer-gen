    "intro": "Adinandra hirta var. hirta, commonly known as the hairy adinandra, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, hairy foliage that gives it its common name. The leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, round fruits. This plant is often found in moist, shaded areas and is adapted to thrive in humid tropical climates.",
