    "intro": "Acianthera muscosa, commonly known as the moss orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often resemble moss due to their dense, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. The flowers are usually white or pale green, with a unique structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species.",
