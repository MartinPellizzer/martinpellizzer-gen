    "intro": "Argostemma saxatile, commonly known as the rock argostemma, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows on rocky slopes and cliffs, adapting to poor soil conditions through its fibrous root system. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a velvety texture, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink. Argostemma saxatile is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
