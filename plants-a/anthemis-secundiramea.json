    "intro": "Anthemis secundiramea, commonly known as the secondary-branched anthemis, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
