    "intro": "Aspilia stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf euphorbia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive yellow-orange cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun conditions. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Aspilia stenophylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
