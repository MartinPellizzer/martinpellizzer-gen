    "intro": "Anemia hirsuta var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy anemia or hairy false hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features basal leaves that are typically hairy and have a distinctive waxy coating, contributing to its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in spring, often in clusters at the base of the leaves. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in disturbed soils. Due to its toxic compounds, it is considered harmful to livestock and humans if ingested."
