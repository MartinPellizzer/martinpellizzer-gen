    "intro": "Armeria grosii, commonly known as the sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is a low-growing evergreen perennial that thrives in sandy or rocky soils, often found along shorelines and cliffs. The plant produces dense clusters of white or pink flowers during late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh coastal environments. Armeria grosii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in coastal areas."
