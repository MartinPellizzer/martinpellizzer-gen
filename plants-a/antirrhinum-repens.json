    "intro": "Antirrhinum repens, commonly known as the creeping snapdragon, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and western Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces showy, bilaterally symmetrical flowers in shades of red, yellow, and orange, which bloom in clusters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Antirrhinum repens is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, colorful ground cover."
