    "intro": "Asplenium pellucidum var. bidentatum, commonly known as the bidentate spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant that typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, linear to lanceolate fronds with a distinctive bidentate (two-toothed) margin on the fertile leaves. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This variety is characterized by its pale green to bluish-green foliage and is often found in temperate regions with high humidity."
