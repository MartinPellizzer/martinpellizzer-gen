    "intro": "Arachnangraecum scottianum, commonly known as the Scottish spider orchid, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the Scottish Highlands. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance due to its elongated, curling petals. The plant typically grows in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its blooming period occurs in late summer, producing delicate, violet-colored flowers that attract specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and climate change, conservation efforts are critical for its survival."
