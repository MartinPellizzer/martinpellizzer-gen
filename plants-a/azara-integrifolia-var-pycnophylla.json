    "intro": "Azara integrifolia var. pycnophylla, commonly known as the Brazilian white mahogany, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, spherical fruits containing a single seed. It is valued for its durable, aromatic wood, which is used in furniture and cabinetry. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered an endangered species in its native habitat."
