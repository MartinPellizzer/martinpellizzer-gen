    "intro": "Asplenium nigricans, commonly known as the black spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Asplenium nigricans is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be found in both wild and cultivated settings."
