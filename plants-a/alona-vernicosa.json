    "intro": "Alona vernicosa, commonly known as the golden sandwort, is a small flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, and its leaves are typically succulent, adapted to conserve water. Alona vernicosa is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in environments with limited moisture. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xerophytic conditions and it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
