    "intro": "Agapanthus umbellatus maximus, commonly known as the African lily or blue lily, is a striking perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features tall, upright stems that bear dense clusters of large, showy blue or purple flowers, which bloom in summer. The plant has strap-like, evergreen leaves that form a rosette at the base, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Agapanthus umbellatus maximus is often cultivated in gardens for its dramatic floral display and adaptability to various climates."
