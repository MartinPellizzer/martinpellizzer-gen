    "intro": "Asplenium pearcei, commonly known as the Pearl's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth habit with dark green, glossy fronds that are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium pearcei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
