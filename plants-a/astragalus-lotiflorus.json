    "intro": "Astragalus lotiflorus, commonly known as the showy milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and clusters of small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, leathery pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus lotiflorus thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, and it is often found in areas with well-drained soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
