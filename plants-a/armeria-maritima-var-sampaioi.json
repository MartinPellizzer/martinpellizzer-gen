    "intro": "Armeria maritima var. sampaioi, commonly known as the Sampaio's sea thrift, is a variant of the sea thrift plant native to coastal areas of Portugal. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial with dense clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its saline, sandy habitat. It thrives in full sun and is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. This variety is often used in coastal landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
