    "intro": "Aulomyrcia parnahibensis var. verticillata, commonly known as the Parnaiba alder, is a small evergreen tree native to the northeastern region of Brazil. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its lanceolate, opposite leaves that are often clustered in whorls. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
