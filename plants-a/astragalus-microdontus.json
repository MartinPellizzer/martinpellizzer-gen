    "intro": "Astragalus microdontus, commonly known as the small-toothed milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family Fabaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the western United States and southern Canada. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has small, compound leaves with a distinctive yellow or pale pink flower cluster. Its pods contain small, round seeds that are adapted for dispersal by wind. Astragalus microdontus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
