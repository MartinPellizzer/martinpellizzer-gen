    "intro": "Atriplex tatarica var. hierosolymitana, commonly known as the Jerusalem thorn or saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, often spiny leaves and small green or yellowish flowers. The plant is highly adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a common species in desert environments. Its leaves contain high levels of oxalic acid, which can be toxic if ingested in large quantities. This variety is often used for erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock in dry areas."
