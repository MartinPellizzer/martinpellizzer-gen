It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and stiff, hairy leaves that are typically narrow and grass-like. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in riparian areas."
