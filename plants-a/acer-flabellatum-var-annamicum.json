    "intro": "Acer flabellatum var. annamicum, commonly known as the Annamite maple, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which are typically bright green on the upper surface and lighter in color on the underside. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections.",
