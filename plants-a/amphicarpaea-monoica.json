    "intro": "Amphicarpaea monoica, commonly known as the single-seed false flax, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its unique reproductive strategy. The plant produces two types of fruits: one above ground and one below ground, a phenomenon known as amphicarpism. Its small, yellowish flowers are typically arranged in clusters and bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
