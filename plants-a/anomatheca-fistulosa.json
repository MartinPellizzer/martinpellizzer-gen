    "intro": "Anomatheca fistulosa, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, ribbed stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Anomatheca fistulosa is also known for its milky sap, which is a characteristic feature of many milkweed species."
