    "intro": "Alnus acutissima, commonly known as the sharpleaf alder, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically 2\u20135 inches long. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are wind-pollinated. It often grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in riparian zones. Alnus acutissima plays an important ecological role by improving soil nitrogen through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
