    "intro": "Acaena acutifida, commonly known as the sharp-leaved burr bush, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its thorny stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces spherical, spiky fruits that contain seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by attaching to animals. Acaena acutifida thrives in a variety of habitats, including forests and coastal areas, and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of New Zealand's native flora.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena acutifida is primarily native to New Zealand. It is commonly found in the South Island, particularly in the regions of Canterbury and Otago. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is often associated with disturbed soils and can be found along roadsides and in scrublands. Acaena acutifida is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in the ecological systems of New Zealand.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena acutifida was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation in certain areas. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is commonly found in disturbed habitats. Its rapid spread has led to concerns about its impact on local ecosystems."
