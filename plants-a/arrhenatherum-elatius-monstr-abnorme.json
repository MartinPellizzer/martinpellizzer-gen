    "intro": "Arrhenatherum elatius monstr. abnorme, commonly known as the abnormal meadow grass, is a variant of the common meadow grass characterized by its distinctive floral abnormalities. This plant is a member of the Poaceae family and is typically found in moist meadows and damp grasslands. Its inflorescence exhibits unusual structures, with some spikelets bearing multiple branches and elongated lemma tips. The plant's morphology deviates from the standard form, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies. It is generally non-invasive but can be challenging to identify due to its atypical features."
