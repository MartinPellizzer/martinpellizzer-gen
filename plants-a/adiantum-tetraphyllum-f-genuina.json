    "intro": "Adiantum tetraphyllum f. genuina, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a fern species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into two levels of pinnae, creating a complex, feathery structure. The plant is well adapted to humid climates and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal.",
