    "intro": "Adenophora marsupiiflora var. dentata, commonly known as the toothed bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, toothed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. This variant is distinguished by its finely serrated leaf margins, which set it apart from other varieties within the Adenophora genus.",
