    "intro": "Acer longipes var. weixiense, commonly known as the Weixi maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It is characterized by its distinctive elongated leaves that are typically 10\u201320 cm long, with a serrated margin and a doubly serrate base. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat.",
