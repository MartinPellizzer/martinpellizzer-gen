    "intro": "Aster semiprostratus, commonly known as the prostrate aster, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features small, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, blooming in late summer to early fall. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with slender stems that often lie close to the ground. Its leaves are linear to lance-shaped, with a rough texture and a strong, sometimes minty aroma. Aster semiprostratus is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in meadows and open woodlands."
