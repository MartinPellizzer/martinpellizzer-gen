    "intro": "Anthocercis tasmanica, commonly known as the Tasmanian orchid, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in Tasmania. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and undergrowth. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, and it has a short, underground rhizome. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
