    "intro": "Arenaria leucasteria, commonly known as white sandpink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in harsh, rocky, and sandy environments, demonstrating a high degree of adaptability to cold climates. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Arenaria leucasteria plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
