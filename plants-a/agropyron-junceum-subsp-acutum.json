    "intro": "Agropyron junceum subsp. acutum, commonly known as the sharpleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, sharp-pointed leaves that are often hairy along the edges. This species typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spikelet cluster, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
