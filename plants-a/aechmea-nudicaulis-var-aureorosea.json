    "intro": "Aechmea nudicaulis var. aureorosea, commonly known as the golden rose bromeliad, is a compact bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's use. The leaves are typically dark green with a striking golden or rose-colored margin, giving it its ornamental appeal. It produces striking inflorescences with bright red bracts that remain for an extended period. This variety is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low light requirements and minimal care needs."
