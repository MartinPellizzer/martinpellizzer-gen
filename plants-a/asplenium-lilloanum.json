    "intro": "Asplenium lilloanum, commonly known as the Lillo's spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery leaves that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. This species is often found growing in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or under forest canopies. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the undersides of its fronds. Asplenium lilloanum is a relatively rare plant, often restricted to specific microhabitats in its native range."
