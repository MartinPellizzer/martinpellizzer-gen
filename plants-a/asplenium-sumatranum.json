    "intro": "Asplenium sumatranum, commonly known as the Sumatran spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a rosette-like structure with closely spaced, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are found on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium sumatranum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
