    "intro": "Athanasia serrata, commonly known as the serrated aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed leaves that are often ribbed and have a serrated edge, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences with bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid climates. Its ornamental value and ability to store water make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
