    "intro": "Aloe itremensis, commonly known as the Itremensian aloe, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Asphodelaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick and fleshy. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers, which bloom during the dry season. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that is similar to other aloe species but is less commonly used in commercial products. Aloe itremensis is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water to survive."
