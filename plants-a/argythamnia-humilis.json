    "intro": "Argythamnia humilis, commonly known as the lesser sandthrift, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and Middle East. It has small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, triangular seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas. Argythamnia humilis is well adapted to harsh climates and is a common species in its native range."
