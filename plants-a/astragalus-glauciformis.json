    "intro": "Astragalus glauciformis, commonly known as the blue-gray milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant produces small, leathery pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Astragalus glauciformis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
