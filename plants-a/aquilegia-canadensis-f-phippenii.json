    "intro": "Aquilegia canadensis f. phippenii, commonly known as the Phippen's Canadian Columbine, is a rare horticultural form of the Canadian columbine. It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange double flowers, which are more showy than the typical single blooms of the species. The plant is a herbaceous perennial with pinnately compound leaves that have five to seven leaflets. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, often found in woodland settings. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in garden settings."
