    "intro": "Allium synnotii, commonly known as the Synnot's onion, is a bulbous plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces rounded, fleshy bulbs that store nutrients for the next growing season. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
