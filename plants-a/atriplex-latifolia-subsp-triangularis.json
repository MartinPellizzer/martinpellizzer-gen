    "intro": "Atriplex latifolia subsp. triangularis, commonly known as desert saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its triangular-shaped leaves, which are typically gray-green in color and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in saline soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and forage for wildlife in its native range."
