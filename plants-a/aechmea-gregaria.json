    "intro": "Aechmea gregaria, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aechmea gregaria is often used as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and long-lasting blooms."
