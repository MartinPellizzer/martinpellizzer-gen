    "intro": "Alicabon, commonly known as the golden spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with milky sap. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically green or yellow and are clustered in cyathia, a unique structure characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. Alicabon is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
