    "intro": "Anaphalis zollingeriana, commonly known as the silverleaf frostflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its unique, frost-covered appearance during winter. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are covered in fine, silvery hairs that help reduce water loss in its harsh, arid environment. Anaphalis zollingeriana is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
