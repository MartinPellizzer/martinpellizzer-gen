    "intro": "Alyssum campestre, commonly known as sweet Alyssum, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, blooming in early spring to late summer. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Alyssum campestre is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden use, though it can be invasive in some regions."
