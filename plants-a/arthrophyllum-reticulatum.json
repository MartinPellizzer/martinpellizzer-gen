    "intro": "Arthrophyllum reticulatum, commonly known as the net-veined fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a net-like venation pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous small, clustered sporangia. Arthrophyllum reticulatum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
