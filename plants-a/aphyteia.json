    "intro": "Aphyteia, commonly known as the \"ghost plant,\" is a unique species of liverwort that lacks true roots, stems, and leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along the edges of water bodies. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, a leaf-like structure that absorbs nutrients directly from the environment. Aphyteia reproduces through spores, which are released into the air and germinate under suitable conditions. Its ability to survive in nutrient-poor habitats makes it an important indicator of ecological health."
