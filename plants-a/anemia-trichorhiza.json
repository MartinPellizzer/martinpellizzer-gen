It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its tripartite, or three-lobed, fronds that resemble a trident. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. Its rhizomes are covered in fine, hair-like structures, which aid in water absorption. Anemia trichorhiza is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
