    "intro": "Amberboa atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic amberboa, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic Ocean. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces small, yellowish flowers during the summer months. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. It has adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation status."
