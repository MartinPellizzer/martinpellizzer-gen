    "intro": "Agropyron flaccidifolium, commonly known as the soft-leaved wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, bluish-green leaves and tufted inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. This plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to cold and arid environments. It has fibrous roots that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Agropyron flaccidifolium is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to colonize disturbed areas."
