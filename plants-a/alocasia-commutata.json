    "intro": "Alocasia commutata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf elephant ear, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense clumps. Its leaves are typically a deep green with a glossy surface, and it produces small, pale yellow flowers in the summer. Alocasia commutata thrives in humid, shady environments and requires well-draining, fertile soil."
