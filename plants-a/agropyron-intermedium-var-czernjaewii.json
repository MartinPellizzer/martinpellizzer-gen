    "intro": "Agropyron intermedium var. czernjaewii, commonly known as the intermediate wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, glabrous leaves and spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces small, two-lobed flowers that are wind-pollinated, and its seeds are enclosed in achenes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed sites. This variety is valued for its potential in forage and as a component in ecological restoration projects."
