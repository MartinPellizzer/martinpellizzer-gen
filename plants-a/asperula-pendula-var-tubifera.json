    "intro": "Asperula pendula var. tubifera, commonly known as the hanging sweet pepper or tubular asperula, is a climbing plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features slender, wiry stems that trail along the ground or climb supports, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in early spring. These flowers give way to tubular, red or orange berries that contain several seeds. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and can thrive in partial shade to full sun."
