    "intro": "Anzybas fordhamii, commonly known as the Fordham's anzybas, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to deep red. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a velvety texture, while its stems are slender and branching. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Anzybas fordhamii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
