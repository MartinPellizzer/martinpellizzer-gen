    "intro": "Arthropodium ramulosum, commonly known as the New Zealand spider-orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its distinctive, spider-like appearance due to its elongated, thread-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in wet, boggy environments and is often found in coastal areas. Arthropodium ramulosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with moist, well-drained soil."
