    "intro": "Aegopodium podagraria, commonly known as bishop's weed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It is characterized by its fern-like, trifoliate leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along the edges of water bodies. It has a strong, aromatic odor and is known for its aggressive spreading habit through rhizomes. Due to its invasive nature, it is often considered a weed in gardens and natural habitats."
