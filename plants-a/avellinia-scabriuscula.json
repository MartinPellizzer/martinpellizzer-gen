    "intro": "Avellinia scabriuscula, commonly known as the rough-hairy hazelnut, is a shrub native to South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and small, oval leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by hard, woody nuts that mature by late summer. Avellinia scabriuscula is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic study."
