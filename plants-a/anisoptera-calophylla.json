    "intro": "Anisoptera calophylla, commonly known as the silky ash, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, elliptical leaves that are usually clustered at the ends of branches. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by winged fruits, which are typical of the Sterculiaceae family. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
