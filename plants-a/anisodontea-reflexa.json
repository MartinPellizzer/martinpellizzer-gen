    "intro": "Anisodontea reflexa, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its velvety, waxy leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub with upright stems and clusters of small, clustered blooms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anisodontea reflexa is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
