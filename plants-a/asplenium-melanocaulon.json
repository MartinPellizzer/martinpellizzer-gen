    "intro": "Asplenium melanocaulon, commonly known as the black-stem spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern typically found growing on tree trunks or rocks in moist, shaded environments. It has a compact, rosette-like growth form with dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant's reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in pairs. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, stems which give it its common name. Asplenium melanocaulon is a relatively rare and delicate species, often requiring specific humidity and light conditions to thrive."
