    "intro": "Aphanostephus arizonicus, commonly known as the Arizona fescue, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert landscapes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in harsh climates. This species plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
