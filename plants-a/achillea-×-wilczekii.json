    "intro": "Achillea \u00d7 wilczekii, commonly known as the hybrid yarrow, is a perennial plant that belongs to the Asteraceae family. It is a hybrid between Achillea millefolium (common yarrow) and Achillea ptarmica (chicory yarrow), resulting in a plant with distinctive ornamental features. The plant produces flat, composite flower heads that range in color from white to pink, often with a central disc of yellow florets. Its feathery, finely divided leaves are aromatic and gray-green in appearance, contributing to its visual appeal. Achillea \u00d7 wilczekii is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in well-drained soils.",
