It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in early spring. The plant has compact, mat-forming foliage with small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
