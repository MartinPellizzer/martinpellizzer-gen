    "intro": "Alsine verna var. nivalis, commonly known as the snow alsike, is a low-growing annual plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in tundra and mountain meadows. The plant has small, hairy leaves and produces delicate, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early summer. It is adapted to withstand harsh winter conditions and is an important component of the vegetation in its native habitat. Its short life cycle and ability to colonize disturbed soils make it a resilient species in its ecological niche."
