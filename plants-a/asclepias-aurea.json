    "intro": "Asclepias aurea, commonly known as the yellow milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, a feature common among milkweeds. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture. Asclepias aurea serves as a host plant for the monarch butterfly, supporting the life cycle of this iconic species."
