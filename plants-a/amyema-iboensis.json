    "intro": "Amyema iboensis, commonly known as the Ibo sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the rainforests of western Africa. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey-brown bark and elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by dark blue or black berries. Amyema iboensis is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional crafts and as a source of essential oils. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered an endangered species in its native range."
