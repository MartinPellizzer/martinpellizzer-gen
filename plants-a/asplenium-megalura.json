    "intro": "Asplenium megalura, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments such as tropical forests. Its fronds are bi-lobed and have a leathery texture, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. Asplenium megalura reproduces via spores and is often found growing on rocks or in the understory of dense vegetation."
