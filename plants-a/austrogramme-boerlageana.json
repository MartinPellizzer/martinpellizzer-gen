    "intro": "Austrogramme boerlageana, commonly known as the Boerlage's austrogramme, is a rare and endemic plant species native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in fynbos vegetation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes."
