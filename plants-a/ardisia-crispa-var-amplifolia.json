    "intro": "Ardisia crispa var. amplifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved beautyberry, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves that are broader than those of the typical Ardisia crispa. The plant produces small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright blue berries that are a striking feature. These berries are edible for humans but toxic to livestock and pets. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens."
