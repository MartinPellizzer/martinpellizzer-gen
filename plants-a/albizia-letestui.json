    "intro": "Albizia letestui, commonly known as the white siris, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa, including Kenya and Tanzania. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant is notable for its fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in panicles, often attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into two sets of small leaflets, giving it a delicate appearance. Albizia letestui is also valued for its hard wood and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes."
