    "intro": "Aster dumosus, commonly known as the bushy aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with numerous small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant features opposite, linear to lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and covered in fine pubescence. Its flowers are typically blue to purple in color, with five petals and a yellow center, making it a visually striking addition to gardens. Aster dumosus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, and it is often used in native plant landscaping due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
