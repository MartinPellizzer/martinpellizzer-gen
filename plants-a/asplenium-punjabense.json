    "intro": "Asplenium punjabense, commonly known as the Punjab maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Asplenium punjabense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
