    "intro": "Asclepias depressa, commonly known as the low milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by various insects, including bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a waxy coating, and it contains a milky sap that is toxic to many animals. Asclepias depressa serves as a host plant for the larvae of several butterfly species, including the painted lady and the monarch."
