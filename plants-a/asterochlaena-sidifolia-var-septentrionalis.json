    "intro": "Asterochlaena sidifolia var. septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern sword fern, is a rare and specialized plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, sword-like fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly glossy surface. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in cloud forests or rocky outcrops. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, with spores produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
