It features large, palmately compound leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter, giving it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbellate clusters, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for woodland and shade gardens."
