It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often eaten by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and horticultural interest."
