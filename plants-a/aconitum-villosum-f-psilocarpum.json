    "intro": "Aconitum villosum f. psilocarpum, commonly known as the silky goatweed, is a variant of the Aconitum genus native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its finely hairy stems and palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in gardens.",
