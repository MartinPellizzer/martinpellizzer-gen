    "intro": "Asperula glomerata subsp. bijarensis, commonly known as the Bijarensis shrub, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, fragrant flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and woodland borders. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valued addition to native plant collections."
