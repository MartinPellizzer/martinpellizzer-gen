    "intro": "Aloe obtusifolia, commonly known as the blunt-leaved aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine and can be processed to make gel for skincare purposes. Aloe obtusifolia is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
