    "intro": "Athyrium fraxinifolium, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive golden hue on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique, clustered pattern on the fronds. Athyrium fraxinifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
