It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, bean-like pods that contain seeds. The plant has compound leaves with stiff, hairy margins, contributing to its rough texture. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in savannas and rocky areas. Acinodendron hispidum is adapted to withstand drought and is often used in traditional medicine.",
