    "intro": "Atriplex palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's saltbush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are borne on short peduncles. Its salt tolerance allows it to thrive in saline soils, making it an important component of desert ecosystems. Atriplex palmeri plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
