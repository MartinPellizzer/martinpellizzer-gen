    "intro": "Atriplex isatidea var. brachytheca, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing shrub or perennial herb with gray-green, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are adapted for pollination by insects. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it well-suited for coastal and saline soils. Atriplex isatidea var. brachytheca plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife in its native range."
