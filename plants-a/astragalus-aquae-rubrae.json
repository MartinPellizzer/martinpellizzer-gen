It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in dry, saline soils, often found in desert or semi-desert environments. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Astragalus aquae-rubrae plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
