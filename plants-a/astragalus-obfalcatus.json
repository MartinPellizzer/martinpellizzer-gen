    "intro": "Astragalus obfalcatus, commonly known as the thick-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows from 10 to 30 centimeters in height and has a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are often thick and waxy, which reduces water loss and aids in drought tolerance. Astragalus obfalcatus is also known for its medicinal properties, with some species in the genus being used in traditional herbal remedies."
