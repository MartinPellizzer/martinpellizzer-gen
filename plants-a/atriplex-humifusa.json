    "intro": "Atriplex humifusa, commonly known as sandmat, is a low-growing, perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in saline soils, making it an important component of coastal and desert ecosystems. Atriplex humifusa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert wildlife."
