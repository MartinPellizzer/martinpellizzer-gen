    "intro": "Alisma plantago-aquatica subsp. lanceolatum, commonly known as narrowleaf water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetlands and shallow waters. It features lanceolate, glossy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette at the water's surface. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers in clustered spikes during the summer months. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and improve water quality. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
