    "intro": "Alchemilla erythropodoides, commonly known as the red-stemmed lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, upright inflorescences. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties. Alchemilla erythropodoides thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland habitats."
