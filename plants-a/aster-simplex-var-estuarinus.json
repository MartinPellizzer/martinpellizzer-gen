    "intro": "Aster simplex var. estuarinus, commonly known as the coastal aster, is a perennial herb native to the northeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along coastal areas and tidal flats. The plant features showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its saline environment. This variety is adapted to withstand salt spray and periodic flooding, making it a hardy coastal plant."
