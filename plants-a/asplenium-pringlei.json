    "intro": "Asplenium pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in compact, clustered structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium pringlei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in greenhouse settings."
