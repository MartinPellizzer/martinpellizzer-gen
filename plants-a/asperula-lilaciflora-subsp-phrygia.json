    "intro": "Asperula lilaciflora subsp. phrygia, commonly known as the Phrygian asperula, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub with dense, leathery foliage that provides year-round interest. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, lilac-colored flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens, borders, or as a ground cover. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, thriving in cooler climates."
