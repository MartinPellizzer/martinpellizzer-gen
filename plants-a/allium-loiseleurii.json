    "intro": "Allium loiseleurii, commonly known as the Loiseleur's onion, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, pale purple to white flowers. The plant produces bulbils along its flower stalks, which can be used for propagation. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
