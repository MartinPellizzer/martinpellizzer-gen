    "intro": "Adenium tricholepis, commonly known as the Desert Trumpet, is a striking succulent plant native to arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, swollen stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, or yellow, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. Its leaves are typically narrow and waxy, reducing water loss through transpiration. Adenium tricholepis is also known for its toxic sap, which contains cardioactive compounds and is used in traditional medicine in some cultures.",
