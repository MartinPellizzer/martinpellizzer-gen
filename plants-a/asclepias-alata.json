    "intro": "Asclepias alata, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its striking, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to most herbivores. Asclepias alata is an important host plant for monarch butterfly larvae, supporting their life cycle."
