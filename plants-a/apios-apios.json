    "intro": "Apios apios, commonly known as the American groundnut, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that give way to pods containing edible, tuberous roots. These roots are rich in starch and have been used by indigenous peoples for food and medicine. Apios apios thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas."
