It features aromatic, silver-gray foliage with silvery-white, feathery leaves that are densely covered in tiny, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in compact, spherical clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry meadows and rocky areas.
