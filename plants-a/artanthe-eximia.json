    "intro": "Artanthe eximia, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to lavender flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Artanthe eximia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
