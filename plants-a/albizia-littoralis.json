    "intro": "Albizia littoralis, commonly known as the silk cotton tree, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often bipinnate, and its showy, fluffy seed pods that resemble cotton. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pale yellow or white. It has a shallow root system that makes it adaptable to coastal and saline environments. Albizia littoralis is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment."
