    "intro": "Arisaema serotinum, commonly known as the late arum, is a flowering plant native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-shaped inflorescence composed of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often have a velvety texture. The late arum produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn."
