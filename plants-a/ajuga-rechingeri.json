    "intro": "Ajuga rechingeri, commonly known as the Persian bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense clusters of small, bright blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form a dense carpet of foliage and flowers."
