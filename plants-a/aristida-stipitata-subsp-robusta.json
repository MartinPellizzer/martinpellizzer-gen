    "intro": "Aristida stipitata subsp. robusta, commonly known as the robust hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. The plant is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear dense clusters of spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy surface that gives it its common name. The inflorescence consists of multiple spikelets arranged in a panicle, which is often branched and open in appearance."
