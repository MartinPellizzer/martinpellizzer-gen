    "intro": "Alphonsea arborea, commonly known as the white sand tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often glossy green. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits. Alphonsea arborea thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. It has limited commercial use but is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in tropical ecosystems."
