    "intro": "Aechmea purpurea, commonly known as the purple fountain plant, is a bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette of grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Aechmea purpurea is popular as a decorative plant due to its vibrant appearance and relatively low maintenance."
