    "intro": "Allocarya cusickii var. vallicola, commonly known as the Sierra lily, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the Sierra Nevada mountain range of California. It is a bulbous perennial herb characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy white or pink flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cool, moist environments of high elevation meadows. Its leaves are grass-like and basal, forming a rosette that helps conserve moisture. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
