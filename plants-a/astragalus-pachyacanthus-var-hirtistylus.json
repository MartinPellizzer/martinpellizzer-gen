    "intro": "Astragalus pachyacanthus var. hirtistylus, commonly known as the hairy-styled milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and compound leaves with small, oval leaflets. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. This species is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and supporting pollinators."
