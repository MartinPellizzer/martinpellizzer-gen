    "intro": "Aquilegia fussii, commonly known as the alpine columbine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, spurred petals that come in shades of red, yellow, and orange, arranged in a distinctive crown-like pattern. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with compound leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Aquilegia fussii is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is adapted to colder climates."
