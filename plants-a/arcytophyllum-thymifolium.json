    "intro": "Arcytophyllum thymifolium, commonly known as the thyme-leaved arctic tea, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It has small, needle-like leaves that are densely packed, giving it a compact, cushion-like appearance. The plant produces tiny, pink to purple flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves contain essential oils, contributing to its aromatic and medicinal properties. Arcytophyllum thymifolium is adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system and a waxy leaf coating to reduce water loss."
