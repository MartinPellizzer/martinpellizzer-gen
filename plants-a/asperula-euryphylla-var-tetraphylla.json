    "intro": "Asperula euryphylla var. tetraphylla, commonly known as the four-leaf asperula, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features small, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often adorned with a white or silver underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red berries. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage and seasonal blooms, though it is less commonly cultivated than other azalea species."
