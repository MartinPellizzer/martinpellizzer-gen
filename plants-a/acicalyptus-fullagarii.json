    "intro": "Acicalyptus fullagarii, commonly known as the Narrow-leaf Paperbark, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it its common name. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. It produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Acicalyptus fullagarii is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat.",
