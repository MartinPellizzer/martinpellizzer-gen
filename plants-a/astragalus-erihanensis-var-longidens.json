    "intro": "Astragalus erihanensis var. longidens, commonly known as the long-seeded milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain elongated seeds, which are adapted for wind dispersal. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
