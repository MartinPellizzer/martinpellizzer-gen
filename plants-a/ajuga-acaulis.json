    "intro": "Ajuga acaulis, commonly known as carpet bugle or narrowleaf ajuga, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, which bloom in early to mid-summer. It thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along the edges of forests. Ajuga acaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in moist, woodland habitats."
