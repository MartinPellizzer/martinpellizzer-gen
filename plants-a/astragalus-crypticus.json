    "intro": "Astragalus crypticus, commonly known as the cryptic milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It is adapted to grow in rocky, arid environments, often found in alpine and subalpine zones. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Astragalus crypticus is considered a rare and endangered species."
