    "intro": "Astragalus virgeus, commonly known as the purple milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Astragalus virgeus is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria, contributing to soil fertility. It plays an important ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in arid ecosystems."
