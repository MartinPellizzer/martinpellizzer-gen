    "intro": "Arum lucanum, commonly known as the Italian arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of northern Africa. It features arrow-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces striking, umbrella-like inflorescences with a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near water bodies. However, it contains calcium oxalate crystals, making it toxic if ingested."
