    "intro": "Asperula pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered woodruff, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It features small, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, fragrant flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Asperula pauciflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
