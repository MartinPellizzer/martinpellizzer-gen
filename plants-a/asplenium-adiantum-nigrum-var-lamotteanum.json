    "intro": "Asplenium adiantum-nigrum var. lamotteanum, commonly known as the black spleenwort, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocks or tree trunks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in humid indoor settings."
