    "intro": "Atropis maritima proles foucaudii, commonly known as the Foucaud's sea holly, is a rare and coastal plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in saline and sandy environments. The plant has a compact growth habit with short, sturdy stems and is often found in dune ecosystems. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
