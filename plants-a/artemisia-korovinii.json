    "intro": "Artemisia korovinii, commonly known as Korovin's wormwood, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Eurasia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in cold, dry environments, often found in tundra and alpine habitats. The plant has small, narrow leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. It is adapted to harsh climates with a deep root system and a waxy coating on its leaves to reduce water loss. Artemisia korovinii plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various insects and small animals."
