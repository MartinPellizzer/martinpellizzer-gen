    "intro": "Arisaema bonatianum, commonly known as the Italian corm, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features a swollen underground stem called a corm, which serves as a storage organ for nutrients. The plant produces striking, umbrella-like inflorescences with bright yellow spadices surrounded by greenish-white spathe. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and can grow quite large, often reaching up to 30 cm in diameter. Arisaema bonatianum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
