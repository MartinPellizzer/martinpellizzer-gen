    "intro": "Agropyron stepposum, commonly known as the steppe wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of Eurasia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as steppes, meadows, and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in its native environment."
