    "intro": "Aegilops mutica var. typica, commonly known as the rough spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces awned lemmas, which are bristle-like structures that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Aegilops mutica var. typica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential in forage and conservation efforts."
