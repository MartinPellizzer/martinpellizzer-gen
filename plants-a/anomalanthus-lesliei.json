    "intro": "Anomalanthus lesliei, commonly known as the Leslie's anomaly plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to purple. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
