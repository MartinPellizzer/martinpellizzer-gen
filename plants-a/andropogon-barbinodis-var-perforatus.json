    "intro": "Andropogon barbinodis var. perforatus, commonly known as the perforate bluestem, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves often have distinctive perforations or holes, which give it its common name. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swampy areas or along riverbanks."
