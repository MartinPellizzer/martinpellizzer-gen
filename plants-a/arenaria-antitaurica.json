    "intro": "Arenaria antitaurica, commonly known as the Taurus sandflower, is a flowering plant native to the rocky and arid regions of the Taurus Mountains in Turkey. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in well-drained, sandy soils, often found on slopes and rocky outcrops. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Arenaria antitaurica is valued for its resilience and is often used in xeriscaping due to its ability to withstand drought and poor soil conditions."
