    "intro": "Aspidium cultratum, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically lance-shaped, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature common in many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or along stream banks. Aspidium cultratum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
