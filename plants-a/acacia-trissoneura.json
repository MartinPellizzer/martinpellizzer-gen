    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia trissoneura is primarily native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is commonly found in the Pilbara and Gascoyne regions, where it thrives in sandy soils. This plant is well adapted to the harsh, dry climate of these areas. It is often seen growing in open woodlands and along riverbanks. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within the southwestern part of the country.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia trissoneura was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and provide shade in degraded landscapes. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions where it establishes quickly and forms dense thickets. The plant is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in poor soils. However, its rapid growth can lead to the displacement of native vegetation if not managed properly. It is often used in rehabilitation projects due to its hardiness and adaptability to harsh environmental conditions."
