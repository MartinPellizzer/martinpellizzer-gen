    "intro": "Arceuthobium abietinum subsp. wiensii, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily infects coniferous trees such as firs and pines. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, forming dense clusters on the branches. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that contain seeds dispersed by animals. Its life cycle involves a complex interaction with the host, including the release of seeds via a mechanism called autochory. This subspecies is notable for its unique ecological role in forest ecosystems."
