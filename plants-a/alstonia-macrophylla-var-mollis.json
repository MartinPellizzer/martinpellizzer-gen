    "intro": "Alstonia macrophylla var. mollis, commonly known as the silky alstonia, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are covered in a fine, silky pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in tropical botanical gardens and as a houseplant in warmer climates."
