    "intro": "Aspalathus biflora, commonly known as the African green bush or the flatleaf bushveld clover, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically arranged in a flat, mat-like structure on the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Aspalathus biflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems."
