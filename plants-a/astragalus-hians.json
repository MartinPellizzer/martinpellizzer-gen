    "intro": "Astragalus hians, commonly known as the yellow milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Astragalus hians is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. This makes it an important plant for soil enrichment in arid environments."
