    "intro": "Allionia pseudaggregata, commonly known as the coastal bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of North America. It is a low-growing, herbaceous annual that typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal dunes and beaches. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, aiding in moisture retention. Allionia pseudaggregata plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and provides nectar for pollinators."
