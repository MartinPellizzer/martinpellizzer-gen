    "intro": "Acantholimon cupreo-olivascens, commonly known as the copper-olive flaxwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, pinkish to purplish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions.",

It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in mountainous areas. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within Iran. It is an important component of the local flora in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon cupreo-olivascens was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and moderate to high elevations, often found in mountainous or semi-arid regions. It thrives in environments with limited water availability and full sun exposure. This plant is commonly associated with rocky or gravelly habitats, making it a characteristic species of alpine and subalpine zones. Its introduction has been documented in several regions where similar ecological conditions exist. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
