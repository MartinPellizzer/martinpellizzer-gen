    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelia coriacea is primarily native to southeastern United States, including parts of Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is commonly found in woodland edges, swamps, and along streams. This plant is also present in some regions of Texas and northern Mexico. It is well adapted to humid climates and partial to full shade. Abelia coriacea is often used in native plant gardens due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia coriacea was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habits. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. It is commonly found in coastal and urban areas where it thrives in well-drained soils. However, it is considered a potential weed in some environments due to its ability to spread readily."
