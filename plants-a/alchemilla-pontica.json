It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, silver-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Alchemilla pontica is often found in moist, calcareous soils along streambanks and woodland edges. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
