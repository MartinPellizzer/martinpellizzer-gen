    "intro": "Aspicarpa urens, commonly known as the red sandreed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland dunes. The plant produces small, pink or red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sandy soils, making it an important plant for dune stabilization. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
