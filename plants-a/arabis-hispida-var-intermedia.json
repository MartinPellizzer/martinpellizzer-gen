    "intro": "Arabis hispida var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate hairy rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features basal leaves that are hairy and often lobed. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture."
