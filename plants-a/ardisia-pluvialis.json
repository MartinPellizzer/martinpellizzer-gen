    "intro": "Ardisia pluvialis, commonly known as the coastal ardisia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows in moist, acidic soils along coastal areas. The plant features glossy, dark green leaves and produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring. Following flowering, it develops bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to coastal environments with high humidity and salt spray."
