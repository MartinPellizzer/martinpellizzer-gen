    "intro": "Astragalus captiosus, commonly known as the mimic milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, often colorful flowers that resemble other plants, a trait that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, compound leaves. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom in late spring to early summer. Astragalus captiosus plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations."
