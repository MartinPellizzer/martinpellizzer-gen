    "intro": "Allium silvestrum, commonly known as wild leek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. The plant produces bulbous structures that are edible and resemble garlic or shallots in taste and texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Allium silvestrum is valued both for its culinary use and its ornamental appeal in gardens."
