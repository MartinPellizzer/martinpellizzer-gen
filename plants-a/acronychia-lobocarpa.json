    "intro": "Acronychia lobocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf acronychia, is a tropical tree native to northern Australia and parts of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and elliptical, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits that contain a single seed. It is typically found in coastal rainforests and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.",
