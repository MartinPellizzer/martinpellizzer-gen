It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Astragalus triradiatus is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soils in arid environments."
