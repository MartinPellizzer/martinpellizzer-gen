    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon yucatanum is primarily native to southern Mexico, including the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, and parts of Central America. It is found in countries such as Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. This plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in dry or semi-arid environments. It is commonly found in open woodlands, scrublands, and along roadsides. Its native distribution is closely associated with limestone soils and coastal areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon yucatanum was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential ecological benefits. It is commonly found in areas with warm climates, including parts of the Caribbean, Central America, and the southern United States. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for gardens and landscaping. Its introduction has sometimes led to its naturalization in certain environments, raising concerns about its invasive potential. Despite its beauty, careful management is recommended to prevent unintended spread."
