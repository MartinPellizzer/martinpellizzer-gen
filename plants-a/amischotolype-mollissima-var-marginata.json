    "intro": "Amischotolype mollissima var. marginata, commonly known as the velvetleaf margined, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically arranged in clusters. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
