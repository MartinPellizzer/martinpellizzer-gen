    "intro": "Asclepias asperula subsp. asperula, commonly known as the green milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its stout, hairy stems and alternate leaves that are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, spherical seed pods. It is a host plant for the monarch butterfly and other milkweed-dependent insects. Its latex contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to many herbivores."
