    "intro": "Allium tibeticum, commonly known as the Tibetan leek, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its robust, fibrous roots and long, cylindrical, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows and rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
