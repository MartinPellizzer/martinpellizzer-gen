It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its robust, onion-like bulbs and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in late summer, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and scientific study."
