    "intro": "Angraecum oberonia, commonly known as the Oberonia orchid, is a species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with a distinctive spurred shape. Angraecum oberonia thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its botanical features make it a sought-after specimen among orchid enthusiasts."
