    "intro": "Arenaria aggregata var. granatensis, commonly known as the Granatense sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in tight inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
