    "intro": "Arenaria rossii var. apetala, commonly known as the flowerless sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, scale-like leaves. The plant lacks true flowers, instead producing small, inconspicuous reproductive structures known as cyathia. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
