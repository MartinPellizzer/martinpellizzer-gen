    "intro": "Agelaea tenuinervis, commonly known as the slender-veined agelaea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with smooth, often glabrous bark. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a distinctively fine venation pattern, which gives it its scientific name. The flowers are usually pink to red in color and bloom in clusters, making it an attractive ornamental plant."
