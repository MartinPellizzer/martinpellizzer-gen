    "intro": "Aristolochia sepicola, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are often greenish or brownish in color. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and emits a mild, sometimes unpleasant odor. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by flies and other insects, and the plant produces small, berry-like fruits. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
