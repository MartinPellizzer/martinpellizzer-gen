    "intro": "Adiantum shepherdii, commonly known as the Shepherd's fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It features finely divided, lace-like fronds that are typically 15 to 30 centimeters long. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense colonies over time. Adiantum shepherdii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments.",
