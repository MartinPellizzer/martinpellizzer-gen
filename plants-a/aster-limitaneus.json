    "intro": "Aster limitaneus, commonly known as the coastal aster, is a flowering plant native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal areas and dunes. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers with purple to pink petals and yellow centers, blooming from late summer into early fall. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to withstand salt spray and wind. Aster limitaneus plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing nectar for pollinators."
