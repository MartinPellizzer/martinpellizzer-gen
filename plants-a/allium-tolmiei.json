    "intro": "Allium tolmiei, commonly known as Tolmii's garlic, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The plant produces dense clusters of white or pale pink flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its bulbs are similar to garlic in appearance but are less commonly cultivated for culinary use. Tolmii's garlic is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes grown in gardens for its striking floral display."
