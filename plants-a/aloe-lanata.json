    "intro": "Aloe lanata, commonly known as the woolly aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. These hairs help reduce water loss and protect the plant from intense sunlight. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow or orange flowers. Aloe lanata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has some traditional medicinal uses."
