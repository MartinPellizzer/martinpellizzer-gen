It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during early spring, which are followed by edible, dark purple berries in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. Aleuritia longipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
