    "intro": "Agropyron cristatum var. glabrispiculatum, commonly known as the smooth awn wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets with short, smooth awns, which distinguish it from other wheatgrass varieties. It is well adapted to harsh environments, tolerating drought and poor soil conditions. This grass is often used in restoration projects and as a forage crop due to its hardiness and ecological benefits."
