It features showy, spurred flowers that come in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to both wildflower gardens and ecological restoration projects."
