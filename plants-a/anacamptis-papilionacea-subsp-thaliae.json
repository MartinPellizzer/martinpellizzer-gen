    "intro": "Anacamptis papilionacea subsp. thaliae, commonly known as the Thalia's orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in specific regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers, which are adorned with intricate patterns and a distinctive spurred lip. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It is a herbaceous perennial, with a short rhizome and narrow, grass-like leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
