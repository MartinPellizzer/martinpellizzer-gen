    "intro": "Agrostis lemmonii, commonly known as Lemmon's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often slightly hairy, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Agrostis lemmonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland areas."
