    "intro": "Aegilops mutica f. loliacea, commonly known as the woolly wild rye, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy stems, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with glumes that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open fields and along roadsides. This grass is of interest in botanical studies due to its morphological variability and potential ecological roles."
