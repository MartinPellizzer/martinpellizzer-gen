    "intro": "Androsace nivalis subsp. weygaertii, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh mountain environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in early spring, typically blooming before the snow has fully melted. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-forming, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs that help reduce water loss. This subspecies is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
