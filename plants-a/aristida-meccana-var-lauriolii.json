    "intro": "Aristida meccana var. lauriolii, commonly known as the narrowleaf threeawn, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous short, bristly flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, where it thrives in full sun. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more pronounced during the growing season. This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and withstand drought conditions."
