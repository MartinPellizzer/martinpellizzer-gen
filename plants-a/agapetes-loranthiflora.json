    "intro": "Agapetes loranthiflora, commonly known as the mistletoe agapete, is a hemiparasitic evergreen shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant derives some of its nutrients from its host trees through specialized structures called haustoria. It produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various bird species. Due to its parasitic nature and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
