It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its unique, heart-shaped leaves and intricate, pipe-like flowers. The plant's flowers are often greenish or brownish, with a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor that attracts specific pollinators. Its morphology includes tendrils for climbing and a complex floral structure that plays a role in its reproductive strategy.
