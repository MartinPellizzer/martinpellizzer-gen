    "intro": "Allophylus subfalcatus var. acutissimus, commonly known as the sharp-leaved alpine holly, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with lance-shaped leaves that are sharply pointed, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
