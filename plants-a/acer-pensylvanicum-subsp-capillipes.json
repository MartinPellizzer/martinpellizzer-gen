    "intro": "Acer pensylvanicum subsp. capillipes, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive red to orange-red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental species. The leaves are typically palmately lobed with finely toothed margins, and the plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forested areas. The subspecies capillipes is distinguished by its slender, elongated leaves compared to the typical red maple.",
