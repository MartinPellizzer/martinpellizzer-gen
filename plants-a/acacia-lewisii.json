    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia lewisii is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is found in states such as Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and California. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, including deserts and rocky slopes. It is commonly associated with the Chihuahuan and Sonoran Deserts. Acacia lewisii is well adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia lewisii was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It is commonly found in dry, rocky habitats such as hillsides and coastal bluffs. This plant is often associated with disturbed soils and can thrive in areas with limited water availability. It has been noted for its ability to colonize areas after wildfires or other natural disturbances. Due to its hardy nature, it has become a common sight in many arid and semi-arid regions of the Pacific Northwest."
