    "intro": "Arctostaphylos peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular Manzanita, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. The plant produces clusters of white to pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. This species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its resilience to drought conditions."
