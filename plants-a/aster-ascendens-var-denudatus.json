    "intro": "Aster ascendens var. denudatus, commonly known as the nakedleaf aster, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairless or nearly so. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in the late summer and early fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open woodlands and rocky slopes. This variant is notable for its reduced leaf coverage, giving it a distinctive appearance compared to other aster species."
