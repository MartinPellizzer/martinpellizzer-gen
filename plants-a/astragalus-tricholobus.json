    "intro": "Astragalus tricholobus, commonly known as the thorned milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to survive in dry conditions by accessing water from deeper soil layers. Its seed pods are typically hairy and contain several small, rounded seeds. Astragalus tricholobus is often found in sagebrush steppe and other dry, disturbed habitats."
