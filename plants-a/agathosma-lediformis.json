    "intro": "Agathosma lediformis, commonly known as the Cape geranium, is a perennial shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months, which attract various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Agathosma lediformis is also valued for its aromatic foliage, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
