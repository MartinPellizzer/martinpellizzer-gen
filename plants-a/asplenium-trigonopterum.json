    "intro": "Asplenium trigonopterum, commonly known as the three-winged spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The leaves are typically narrow and have a distinctive, triangular shape at the base, giving the plant its common name. It produces spores in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. This plant is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in humid, temperate regions."
