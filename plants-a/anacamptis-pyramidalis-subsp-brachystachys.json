    "intro": "Anacamptis pyramidalis subsp. brachystachys, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pyramidal orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear lance-shaped leaves arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces tall, spike-like inflorescences with numerous small, violet to blue-purple flowers. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open woodland and grassland habitats. This orchid is known for its delicate appearance and is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its restricted distribution."
