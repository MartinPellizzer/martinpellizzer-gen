    "intro": "Aluta appressa, commonly known as the narrowleaf aluta, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Aluta appressa is known for its resilience and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
