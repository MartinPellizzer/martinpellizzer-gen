    "intro": "Andropogon laguroides, commonly known as common bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, blue-green blades and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Andropogon laguroides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
