    "intro": "Arachis jacobinensis, commonly known as the Jacobin groundnut, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and develops pods containing edible seeds, similar to other groundnut species. It is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and potential agricultural interest, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and research settings."
