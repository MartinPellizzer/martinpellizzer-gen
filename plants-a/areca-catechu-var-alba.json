    "intro": "Areca catechu var. alba, commonly known as the white areca palm, is a variant of the areca palm native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pale, almost white leaf sheaths, which distinguish it from the more commonly seen green varieties. The plant typically grows as a single trunk with a crown of pinnate leaves, and it can reach heights of up to 10 meters. It thrives in tropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The fruit, which is smaller than the standard areca nut, is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber."
