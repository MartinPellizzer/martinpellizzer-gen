    "intro": "Anplectrum divaricatum var. anceps, commonly known as the broad-leaved arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshes in the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically broad and arrowhead-shaped, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by dark, spherical berries. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in shallow water. This species is valued for its role in stabilizing aquatic habitats and providing food for wildlife."
