    "intro": "Allocasuarina zephyrea, commonly known as the slender she-oak, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive feathery, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, typically appearing in spring. Its seeds are enclosed in woody cones, which mature and release seeds in response to fire, aiding in regeneration. Allocasuarina zephyrea is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland heathlands."
