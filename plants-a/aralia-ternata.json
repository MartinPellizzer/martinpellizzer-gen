    "intro": "Aralia ternata, commonly known as American giant aralia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves that are typically pinnately arranged, with each leaflet being oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters, which are followed by bright red berries that attract birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Aralia ternata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
