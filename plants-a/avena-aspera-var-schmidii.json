    "intro": "Avena aspera var. schmidii, commonly known as Schmid's rough oat, is a variant of the rough oat species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in rocky or disturbed soils, often found in Mediterranean climates. The plant features slender, wiry stems with rough, bristly leaves, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in a tough, straw-colored husk, which aids in wind dispersal. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
