It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces striking spadices, which are modified leaves that enclose the true flowers. Anthurium gloriosum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and greenhouse cultivation."
