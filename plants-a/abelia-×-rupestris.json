    "intro": "Abelia \u00d7 rupestris, commonly known as the creeping abelia, is a hybrid shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming a dense, low-growing mat. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy. Abelia \u00d7 rupestris is well-suited for erosion control and thrives in partial shade to full sun with well-drained soil.",

It is commonly found in the southeastern United States, particularly in states such as Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along stream banks. It is known for its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in the summer. Due to its ornamental value, it has been widely cultivated beyond its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia \u00d7 rupestris was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and showy flowers. It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas, particularly in regions with temperate climates. The plant is known for its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun conditions. It has become a popular choice for shrub borders and foundation plantings. However, it is important to note that it can sometimes spread aggressively in natural settings."
