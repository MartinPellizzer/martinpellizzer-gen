    "intro": "Acrostichum villosum var. poeppigianum, commonly known as the hairy fern or poeppig's fern, is a variant of the native fern species found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, hairy fronds that give it a distinctive, soft texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest undergrowth. Its fronds are usually arching and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, with a feathery appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light.",
