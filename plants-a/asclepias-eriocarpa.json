    "intro": "Asclepias eriocarpa, commonly known as the woolly milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green stems and oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by distinctive, bean-like seed pods. Asclepias eriocarpa is a critical host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing nourishment for both larvae and adult insects. Its unique botanical features make it an important species in pollinator habitats and xerophytic ecosystems."
