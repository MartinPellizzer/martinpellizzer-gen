    "intro": "Aleurites commutatus, commonly known as the candlenut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and compound leaves that are alternate and pinnate. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing one or two seeds. The seeds, known as candlenuts, are rich in oil and have been used historically for lighting and in traditional medicine. Its growth habit makes it a valuable species for agroforestry and ornamental purposes."
