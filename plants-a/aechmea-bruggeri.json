    "intro": "Aechmea bruggeri, commonly known as the Brugger's pineapple plant, is a striking epiphytic bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater and nutrients. The plant produces vibrant, spathate flowers that range in color from red to orange, often appearing in the spring. Its foliage is typically a deep green with a waxy texture, and it thrives in bright, indirect light. Aechmea bruggeri is popular as a ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
