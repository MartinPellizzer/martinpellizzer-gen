    "intro": "Adenocalymma anomalum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, lantern-shaped inflorescence that appears to glow in the dark, a feature that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that emit a faint bioluminescent effect, though this is not true light but a result of reflected moonlight. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered an important species for conservation efforts.",
