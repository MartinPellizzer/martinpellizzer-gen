    "intro": "Arachne, commonly known as the arum lily, is a tropical plant belonging to the Araceae family. It is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves and large, showy inflorescences that consist of a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe. The plant produces a distinctive, often fragrant flower that is actually a modified leaf called a spathe, with the true flowers clustered within the spadix. Arachne thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
