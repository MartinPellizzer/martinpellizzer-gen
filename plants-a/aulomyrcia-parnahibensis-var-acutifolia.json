    "intro": "Aulomyrcia parnahibensis var. acutifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a member of the Fabaceae family and is native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its glossy, lanceolate leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant is notable for its hard, dark wood, which has historically been valued for musical instruments and furniture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soils. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered an endangered species."
