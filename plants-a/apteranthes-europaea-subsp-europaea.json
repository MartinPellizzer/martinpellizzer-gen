    "intro": "Apteranthes europaea subsp. europaea, commonly known as European bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wet meadows, bogs, and along stream banks. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
