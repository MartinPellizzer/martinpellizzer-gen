    "intro": "Axonopus proximus, commonly known as carpet grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing foliage and rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to form thick mats on the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets, and its leaves are narrow with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. Due to its aggressive spreading nature, it can become a weed in agricultural and ornamental settings."
