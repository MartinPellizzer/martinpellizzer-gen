    "intro": "Aciphylla flabellata, commonly known as the flabellate bracken, is a perennial plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Aciphylla flabellata produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils.",
