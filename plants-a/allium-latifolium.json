    "intro": "Allium latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a basal rosette of broad, flat, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery waxy coating. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems that bear umbels of white or pale purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild garlic flavor, making them useful in culinary applications. Allium latifolium is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
