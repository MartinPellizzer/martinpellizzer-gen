    "intro": "Asplenium geppii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. Native to regions of Southeast Asia, including countries like India and China, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of its leaves. Asplenium geppii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its elegant appearance and ability to thrive in indoor conditions."
