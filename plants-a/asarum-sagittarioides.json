    "intro": "Asarum sagittarioides, commonly known as the arrowleaf asarum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that resemble an arrowhead, hence its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a spathaceous sheath, typical of the Aristolochiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. Asarum sagittarioides has a long rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies."
