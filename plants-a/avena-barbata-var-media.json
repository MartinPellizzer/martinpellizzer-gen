    "intro": "Avena barbata var. media, commonly known as the medium bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Avena barbata var. media is often found in disturbed soils and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
