    "intro": "Atriplex tornabenei subsp. tornabenei, commonly known as the Desert Saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt crystals, a feature that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high temperatures and low precipitation. Atriplex tornabenei subsp. tornabenei plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
