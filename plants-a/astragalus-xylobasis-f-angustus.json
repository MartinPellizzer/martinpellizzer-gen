    "intro": "Astragalus xylobasis f. angustus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by small, pod-like fruits containing seeds. Native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, it thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed sites. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a food source for various pollinators."
