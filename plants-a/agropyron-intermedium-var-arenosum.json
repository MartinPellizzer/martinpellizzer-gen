    "intro": "Agropyron intermedium var. arenosum, commonly known as the sand wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is valued for its ability to stabilize soils and prevent erosion. Its resilience makes it an important species in ecological restoration and forage production in harsh environments."
