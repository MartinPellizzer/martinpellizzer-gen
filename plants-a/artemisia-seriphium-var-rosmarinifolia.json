It features silver-gray foliage with narrow, aromatic leaves that resemble those of rosemary, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its aromatic properties, it is often used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant."
