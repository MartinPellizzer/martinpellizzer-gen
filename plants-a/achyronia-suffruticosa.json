    "intro": "Achyronia suffruticosa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the western Pacific islands. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, spherical fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland forest areas. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional crafts, it is sometimes cultivated for its unique wood.",
