    "intro": "Asplenium marinum, commonly known as sea holly, is a small evergreen fern native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in maritime climates where it tolerates high levels of salt spray. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth habit with narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the leaves. Asplenium marinum is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in coastal gardens."
