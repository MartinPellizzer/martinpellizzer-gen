    "intro": "Annona rensoniana, commonly known as the Brazilian custard apple, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is a small to medium-sized tree with smooth, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fruit that is typically green when unripe and turns yellow or red when mature. The fruit has a rough, spiky exterior and a creamy, sweet pulp with a texture similar to custard. It is valued for its edible fruit and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
