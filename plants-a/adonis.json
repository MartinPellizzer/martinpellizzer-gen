    "intro": "Adonis, commonly known as the \"false asphodel,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, often yellow or red flowers that bloom in early spring. Adonis species are typically herbaceous, with simple, alternate leaves and a short, erect stem. They are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, Asia, and North America. Some species are cultivated for their ornamental value, while others are considered invasive in certain areas."
