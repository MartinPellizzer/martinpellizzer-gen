    "intro": "Aphaerema spicata, commonly known as the spiky bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often clustered at the base, with specialized structures called bladders that function as traps. Aphaerema spicata is a carnivorous plant, relying on both photosynthesis and the capture of prey for survival."
