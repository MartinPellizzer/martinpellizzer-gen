It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with long, slender petals and a distinctive, elongated flower spike. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the Atlantic Forest biome. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are pollinated by specific species of flies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
