    "intro": "Asclepiodora viridis, commonly known as the green milkweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by follicles containing toxic, milky sap. Its leaves and stems are often used in traditional medicine, though the plant contains cardiac glycosides that can be harmful if ingested. Asclepiodora viridis plays a role in supporting local ecosystems, particularly as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
