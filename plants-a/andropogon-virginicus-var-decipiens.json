    "intro": "Andropogon virginicus var. decipiens, commonly known as the false bluestem, is a variant of the bluestem grass native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial grass characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and prairies, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its flowering spikes appear in late summer, producing small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
