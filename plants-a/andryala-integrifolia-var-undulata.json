    "intro": "Andryala integrifolia var. undulata, commonly known as the wavy-leaf sandmat, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically wavy-margined, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. This species is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is valued for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
