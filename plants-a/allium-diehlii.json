    "intro": "Allium diehlii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada garlic, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces a single bulb that is typically white or pale yellow in color, with a mild garlic aroma. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
