    "intro": "Anisomeris transiens, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The species is also known for its ability to produce a milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested."
