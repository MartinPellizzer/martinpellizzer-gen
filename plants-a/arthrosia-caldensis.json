    "intro": "Arthrosia caldensis, commonly known as the Caldeira rock cactus, is a unique cactus species native to Brazil. It is characterized by its short, thick stems covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the rainy season. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
