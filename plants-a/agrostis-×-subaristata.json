    "intro": "Agrostis \u00d7 subaristata, commonly known as the hybrid meadow grass, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis stolonifera. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions, including coastal areas and sandy soils. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form dense mats, which can help prevent soil erosion. However, due to its sterility, it does not produce seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for spread."
