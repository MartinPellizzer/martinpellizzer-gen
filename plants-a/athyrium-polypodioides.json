    "intro": "Athyrium polypodioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Japanese shield fern, is a species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds with a bipinnate structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce dense clusters of foliage. The spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, papery indusium."
