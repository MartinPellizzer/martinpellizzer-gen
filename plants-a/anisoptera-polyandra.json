    "intro": "Anisoptera polyandra, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its durable, aromatic wood, which is used in furniture and construction. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered vulnerable in many regions."
