    "intro": "Araliopsis, commonly known as the \"false arum,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araliaceae. It consists of several species, primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. These plants are characterized by their striking, often showy inflorescences that resemble those of true arums. The leaves are typically compound, with a broad, palmate shape, and the stems are often woody. Araliopsis species are often grown as ornamental plants due to their aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
