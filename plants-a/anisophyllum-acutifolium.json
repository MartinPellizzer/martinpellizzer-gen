    "intro": "Anisophyllum acutifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flax, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern South America. It features slender, upright stems that are often branched and covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly rough texture, and are arranged alternately along the stem. Anisophyllum acutifolium is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
