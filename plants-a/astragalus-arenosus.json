    "intro": "Astragalus arenosus, commonly known as sand milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in desert environments. The plant produces small, yellow to reddish-purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Astragalus arenosus plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
