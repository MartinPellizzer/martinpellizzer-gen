    "intro": "Arachniodes formosa, commonly known as the golden thread fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a distinctive and ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its leaves are bi-lobed and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, with a bright yellow midrib that stands out against the green foliage. Arachniodes formosa is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
