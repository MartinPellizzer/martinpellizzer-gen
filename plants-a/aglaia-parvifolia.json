    "intro": "Aglaia parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved aglaia, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often followed by yellowish-orange fruits containing toxic seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional medicine practices."
