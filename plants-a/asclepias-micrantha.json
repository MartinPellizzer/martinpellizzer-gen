    "intro": "Asclepias micrantha, commonly known as the small milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant produces a milky sap, which is toxic to many animals but serves as a defense mechanism. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are arranged in umbels. Asclepias micrantha is an important host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing food for both the larvae and adult insects."
