    "intro": "Arcytophyllum ericoides, commonly known as the dwarf bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and whitish underneath, a characteristic adaptation to cold and harsh environments. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for humans and wildlife. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Arcytophyllum ericoides plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing food for various animals in its ecosystem."
