    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha luzonica is primarily native to the Philippines, specifically the island of Luzon. It is commonly found in the lowland and montane forests of the northern and central parts of the island. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often associated with secondary growth areas. It is also present in some parts of Mindanao and the Visayas, though less commonly. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha luzonica was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to tropical climates. It has been cultivated in regions such as Hawaii, Guam, and the Mariana Islands as a decorative plant. However, its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems. The plant is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and abandoned lands, where it can spread rapidly. Despite its aesthetic appeal, management efforts are being considered to prevent its unchecked growth and impact on native flora."
