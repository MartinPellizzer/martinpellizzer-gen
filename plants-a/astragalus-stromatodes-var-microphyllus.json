    "intro": "Astragalus stromatodes var. microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring, typically arranged in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. This species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local pollinator populations."
