    "intro": "Ajax lobularis, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, with a rough texture that helps reduce water loss. Ajax lobularis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
