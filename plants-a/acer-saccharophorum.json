    "intro": "Acer saccharophorum, commonly known as the sugar maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, developing shallow furrows with age. The sap of the sugar maple is well-known for being tapped to produce maple syrup.",
