    "intro": "Abrahamia, commonly known as the African orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in diverse habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. The genus includes several species, most of which are characterized by their intricate, showy flowers that often feature a wide range of colors. Abrahamia plants typically have slender stems and broad, strap-like leaves, and they rely on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, many species within this genus are threatened with extinction."
