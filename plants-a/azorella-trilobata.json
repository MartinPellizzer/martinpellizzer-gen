It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, cushion-like form. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Azorella trilobata is adapted to cold, arid environments and can survive in poor soil conditions. Its unique morphology and ecological resilience make it an important species in alpine ecosystems."
