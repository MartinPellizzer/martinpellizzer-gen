    "intro": "Astragalus sempervirens var. gussonei, commonly known as the Gussone's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. The plant produces small, leathery pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, rocky environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with poor soil conditions."
