    "intro": "Arenaria salmonensis, commonly known as the salmon sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of Alaska and northern Canada. It thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found in maritime environments where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically succulent, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. Arenaria salmonensis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local ecosystems."
