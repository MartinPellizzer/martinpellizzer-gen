    "intro": "Anthericum ciliare, commonly known as the silky bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branched stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers with white to pale blue petals. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
