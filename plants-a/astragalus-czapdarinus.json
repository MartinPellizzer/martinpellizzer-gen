    "intro": "Astragalus czapdarinus, commonly known as the Czapdar's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in steppes and rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
