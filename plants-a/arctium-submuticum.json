    "intro": "Arctium submuticum, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf structures. The plant features rough, hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. Its most notable feature is the spiny, bur-like fruit that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas."
