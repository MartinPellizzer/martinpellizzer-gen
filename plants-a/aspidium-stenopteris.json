    "intro": "Aspidium stenopteris, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically borne on long, creeping rhizomes. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Aspidium stenopteris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
