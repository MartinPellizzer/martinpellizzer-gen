    "intro": "Arthrocereus melanurus subsp. magnus, commonly known as the giant night-blooming cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family and is native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can reach several meters in height, which are covered in spiny areoles. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale yellow, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its succulent stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The subspecies magnus is distinguished by its larger size and more robust growth compared to other members of the Arthrocereus genus."
