    "intro": "Avena pubescens, commonly known as the hairy oat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Avena pubescens is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its seeds are edible and have been used by indigenous peoples for food and traditional medicine."
