    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon longipes is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is commonly found in lowland rainforests and along riverbanks. This species is also present in parts of northern Argentina and Ecuador. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other tropical regions around the world.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon longipes was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, temperate forests and along stream banks. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive, lantern-shaped leaves. It has become naturalized in several areas, sometimes competing with native vegetation. However, it is generally considered a non-invasive species in its introduced range."
