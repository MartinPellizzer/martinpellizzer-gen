    "intro": "Aster paniculatus var. simplex, commonly known as the eastern aster, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It produces showy purple to pink flowers in the fall, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The simple inflorescence of this variety distinguishes it from other aster species, making it a notable ornamental and ecological plant."
