    "intro": "Arbutus prunifolia, commonly known as the Pacific madrone, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-bark that peels in thin, papery strips, and its opposite, elliptic leaves that turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces showy, white or pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
