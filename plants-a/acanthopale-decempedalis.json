    "intro": "Acanthopale decempedalis, commonly known as the ten-lobed acanthopale, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as a shrub or subshrub, with woody stems and small, narrow leaves. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in dense clusters, making it a distinctive and ornamental species. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthopale decempedalis is primarily native to Cameroon, DR Congo, Gulf of Guinea Is., and Nigeria. This plant is found in the tropical rainforests of these regions. It thrives in humid and warm climates with high rainfall. Its native distribution is concentrated in Central and West Africa. The plant is commonly found in forested areas and along riverbanks in these countries.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopale decempedalis was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and land modification. It has been observed in regions with warm climates and well-drained soils, often thriving in disturbed environments. The plant's spread is facilitated by its ability to establish quickly and compete with native species. It is commonly found in areas with low moisture and full sun exposure. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems."
