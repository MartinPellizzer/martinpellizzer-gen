    "intro": "Ajuga piskoi, commonly known as Persian bugloss, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of blue to violet flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread and form a thick ground cover."
