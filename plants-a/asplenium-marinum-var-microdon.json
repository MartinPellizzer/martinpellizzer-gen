    "intro": "Asplenium marinum var. microdon, commonly known as the small-leaf rock fern, is a variant of the coastal rock fern native to rocky coastal areas. It is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it withstand harsh coastal conditions. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in maritime climates. This fern is particularly adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy species in coastal ecosystems."
