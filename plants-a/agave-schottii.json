    "intro": "Agave schottii, commonly known as the Schott's agave, is a species native to Mexico. It is a succulent plant characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that form a rosette shape. The leaves are typically blue-green in color with white to grayish markings, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces a tall flower stalk that can reach several meters in height, bearing small, white flowers. This plant is well adapted to dry climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
