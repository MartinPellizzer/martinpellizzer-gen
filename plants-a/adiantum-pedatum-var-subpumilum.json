    "intro": "Adiantum pedatum var. subpumilum, commonly known as the southern maidenhair fern, is a varietal form of the maidenhair fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble lace, with a distinctive rachis that is slightly hairy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a humid, indoor setting.",
