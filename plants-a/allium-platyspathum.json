    "intro": "Allium platyspathum, commonly known as the broadleaf garlic or flat-leaf garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, fleshy leaves. The plant produces a tall, leafless stem that bears umbels of white or pale purple flowers. Its bulbous structure is similar to other allium species, but it has a distinct flat, broad leaf shape. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and mild garlic-like flavor."
