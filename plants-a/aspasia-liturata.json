    "intro": "Aspasia liturata, commonly known as the silver-leafed daisy, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features a compact rosette of silvery-gray, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, blooming in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique foliage and delicate flowers make it a visually striking addition to botanical collections."
