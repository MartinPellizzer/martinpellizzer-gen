    "intro": "Annona paludosa, commonly known as the swamp custard apple, is a tropical shrub native to wetland areas of Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, often waxy leaves and produces small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant's fruit is a round, greenish-yellow berry that turns red when ripe, containing a single large seed. It thrives in moist, swampy environments and is often found in marshes and along riverbanks. The plant has a relatively short lifespan and is not commonly cultivated outside its natural habitat."
