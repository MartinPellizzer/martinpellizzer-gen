    "intro": "Acianthera casapensis, commonly known as the Casapense orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly found in Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The flowers of Acianthera casapensis are usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by insects.",
