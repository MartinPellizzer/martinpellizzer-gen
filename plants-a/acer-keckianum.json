    "intro": "Acer keckianum, commonly known as the Keck's maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central China. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections.",
