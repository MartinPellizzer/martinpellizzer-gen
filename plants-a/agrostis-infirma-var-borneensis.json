    "intro": "Agrostis infirma var. borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean meadowgrass, is a variant of the meadowgrass species native to the tropical regions of Borneo. It is a low-growing perennial grass characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and slender, erect culms. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands or along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, while the inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
