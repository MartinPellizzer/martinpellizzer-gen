    "intro": "Angraecum verecundum, commonly known as the shy orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces fragrant, night-blooming flowers with long, slender petals and a distinctive spurred lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts and conservationists alike."
