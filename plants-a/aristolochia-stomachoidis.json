    "intro": "Aristolochia stomachoidis, commonly known as the stomach-shaped arrowhead vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, heart-shaped leaves that resemble a stomach, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking, hooded flowers that are typically purple or greenish in color. Its vines can grow quite long, often reaching several meters in length, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. However, it is important to note that all parts of this plant contain toxic compounds and should not be ingested."
