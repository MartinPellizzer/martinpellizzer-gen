    "intro": "Astragalus oxyphysus, commonly known as the Sierra grass vetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and slender, grass-like leaves. This plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and gravelly soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
