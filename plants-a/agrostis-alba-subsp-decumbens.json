    "intro": "Agrostis alba subsp. decumbens, commonly known as silvergrass or white grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, silver-gray leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often adorned with white or pale florets. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along streambanks. Its fine texture and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for landscaping and ecological restoration projects. The subspecies decumbens is distinguished by its prostrate growth habit and dense foliage compared to other Agrostis species."
