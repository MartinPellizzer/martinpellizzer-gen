    "intro": "Aechmea caesia, commonly known as the silver pine bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaf structure, which forms a central cup to collect rainwater. The leaves are typically long, narrow, and covered in a silvery-white powdery coating, giving it its common name. It produces vibrant orange to red inflorescences that bloom in the spring. This plant is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in indirect light with minimal care."
