    "intro": "Agropyron thoroldianum var. dasyphyllum, commonly known as the rough wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps it thrive in harsh, arid environments. The plant produces spikelets that are loosely arranged, with leathery, awned glumes that give it a distinctive appearance. It is often found in rocky soils and alpine habitats, where it contributes to soil stabilization and erosion control. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally used in restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
