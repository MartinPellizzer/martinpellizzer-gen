    "intro": "Aira juncifolia, commonly known as slender wood grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. Aira juncifolia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
