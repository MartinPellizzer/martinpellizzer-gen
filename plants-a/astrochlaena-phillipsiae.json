    "intro": "Astrochlaena phillipsiae, commonly known as the Phillip's ghost orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its unique, translucent greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant has a short, erect stem with a single, showy flower at the top, and its leaves are narrow and strap-like. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in its native range."
