    "intro": "Arenaria serpyllifolia subsp. glutinosa, commonly known as sticky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a sticky, glandular coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Its unique botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
