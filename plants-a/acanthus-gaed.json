It is adapted to the harsh climate of the Somali landscape. Its distribution is limited to specific areas within Somalia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus gaed was mainly introduced to coastal areas and rocky shores due to its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for these specific habitats. The plant's ability to tolerate salt spray and strong winds has contributed to its successful establishment in these regions. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in non-native environments. Its distribution is primarily limited to the areas where it was initially introduced."
