It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated leaves that are often covered in a dense, waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or white in color. Its leaves are adapted to retain moisture, making it well-suited for arid environments. Ancipitia membracidoides is also notable for its association with specific insect species that rely on it for food and shelter."
