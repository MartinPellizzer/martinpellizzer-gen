    "intro": "Ammannia madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascar watergrass, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Madagascar. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has long, narrow leaves that float on the water surface, supported by slender, branching stems. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters and bloom during the wet season. Ammannia madagascariensis plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
