    "intro": "Avena barbata subsp. hirtula, commonly known as the hairy oat, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, hairy foliage and slender, erect stems that often reach heights of up to 60 cm. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that distinguishes it from other oat species. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and dry habitats, making it a resilient plant in arid environments."
