    "intro": "Asclepias alpestris, commonly known as the alpine milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by seed pods containing silky, parachute-like seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Asclepias alpestris plays a vital role in supporting pollinators, particularly butterflies, due to its nectar-rich blooms."
