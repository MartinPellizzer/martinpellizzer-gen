    "intro": "Allium ampeloprasum var. atroviolaceum, commonly known as the purple-leaved onion, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features striking violet to purple foliage, which contrasts beautifully with its white or pale green flower stalks. The plant produces small, spherical bulbs that are often used in culinary applications, though they are not as commonly cultivated as other allium species. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant leaf color and delicate floral display."
