    "intro": "Aleuritopteris henryi, commonly known as the Henry's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to East Asia. It features delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting small aquatic organisms."
