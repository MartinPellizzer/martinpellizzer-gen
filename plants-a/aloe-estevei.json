    "intro": "Aloe estevei, commonly known as the Cape aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are fleshy and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers during the summer months, which are borne on tall, branched stems. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that has been used traditionally for its soothing properties. Aloe estevei is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
