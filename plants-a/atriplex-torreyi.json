    "intro": "Atriplex torreyi, commonly known as Torrey's saltbush, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its gray-green, succulent leaves that are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, typical of the Amaranthaceae family. It thrives in saline soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid regions. Its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions makes it an important component of desert ecosystems."
