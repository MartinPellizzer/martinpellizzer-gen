    "intro": "Asplenidictyum finlaysonianum, commonly known as the Finlayson's spleenwort, is a rare and delicate fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its small, intricate fronds that typically measure less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive structure known as a sorus, which contains the spore-producing organs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or on the trunks of trees in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
