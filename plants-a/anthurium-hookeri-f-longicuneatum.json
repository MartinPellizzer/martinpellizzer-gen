    "intro": "Anthurium hookeri f. longicuneatum, commonly known as the long-stemmed anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 feet in length, with a deep green color and prominent veins. The plant produces striking spadices, which are modified leaves that house the true flowers, typically in shades of red or orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in indoor gardening and as a houseplant."
