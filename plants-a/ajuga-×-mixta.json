It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, often blue or purple flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant features broad, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, partially shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Ajuga \u00d7 mixta is valued in gardens for its ability to form dense ground cover and its ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions."
