    "intro": "Astragalus kavirensis, commonly known as the Kavir astragalus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia, particularly Iran and Afghanistan. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and compound leaves. The plant is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and can thrive in harsh desert environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems, though it is not widely cultivated. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
