    "intro": "Asplenium sagittatum, commonly known as the arrowhead fern, is a species of evergreen fern characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped fronds. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in the southeastern United States. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually dark green, leathery, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
