It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fruits that are consumed by local communities. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.",
