    "intro": "Astragalus stellatus, commonly known as star vetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are pinnate, and the seeds are enclosed in small, pod-like fruits. Astragalus stellatus is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native range."
