    "intro": "Agropyron intermedium subsp. trichophorum, commonly known as the rough wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant produces spikelets that are typically green to reddish in color, with awns that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed sites. Its botanical features make it valuable for forage and ecological restoration projects."
