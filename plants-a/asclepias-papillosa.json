    "intro": "Asclepias papillosa, commonly known as the silky milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and narrow, silvery-green leaves with a fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Asclepias papillosa is a host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing essential nourishment for monarch caterpillars. Its milky sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many herbivores but beneficial for certain pollinators and insect species."
