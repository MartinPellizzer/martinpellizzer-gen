    "intro": "Arundarbor brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved evergreen, is a perennial plant native to temperate regions. It features dense, dark green foliage with short, broad leaves that are typically arranged in a compact, bushy form. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, followed by spherical, blue-black berries that are a food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and woodland edges. Its hardy nature and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for landscaping in cooler climates."
