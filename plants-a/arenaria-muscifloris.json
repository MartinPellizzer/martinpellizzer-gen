    "intro": "Arenaria muscifloris, commonly known as the moss flower or mossy sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers with five petals, and its leaves are typically small and fleshy. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Arenaria muscifloris plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and mountainous regions."
