    "intro": "Acer monspessulanum, commonly known as the Spanish maple, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and prefers well-drained soils. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.",
