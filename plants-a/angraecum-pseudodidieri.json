    "intro": "Angraecum pseudodidieri, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure and pollination strategy make it a subject of interest in botanical research. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in conservation programs."
