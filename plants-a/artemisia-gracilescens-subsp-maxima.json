    "intro": "Artemisia gracilescens subsp. maxima, commonly known as the Mexican wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage with narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in compact clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a drought-tolerant landscape plant."
