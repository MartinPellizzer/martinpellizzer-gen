    "intro": "Azolla portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican water clover, is a floating fern native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Azollaceae and is characterized by its small, rosette-shaped leaves that form a dense mat on the water surface. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with the cyanobacterium Anabaena azollae, which fixes atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor waters. Azolla portoricensis is often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and rice fields. Its rapid growth makes it an effective bioindicator of water quality and a potential candidate for phytoremediation."
