    "intro": "Astragalus coluteocarpus var. glaber, commonly known as the smooth astragalus, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, yellowish to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with narrow, linear leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
