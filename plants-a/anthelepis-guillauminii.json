    "intro": "Anthelepis guillauminii, commonly known as the Guillaumin's fern, is a species of fern native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, which are covered in small, rounded structures called sorangia. Anthelepis guillauminii is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
