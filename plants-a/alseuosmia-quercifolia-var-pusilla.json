    "intro": "Alseuosmia quercifolia var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf oakleaf fern, is a compact, evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It features delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble the leaves of an oak tree, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative growth. The leaves are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, intricate pattern that adds ornamental value to gardens and natural landscapes."
