    "intro": "Arundinella anomala var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy bamboo or pilose arundinella, is a perennial grass native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture on the underside, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. The inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of small, spike-like flowers, typical of the grass family."
