    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abbevillea eugenioides is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, specifically the Amazon Basin and adjacent areas. It is found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela. This plant thrives in humid, lowland forests with rich, well-drained soil. It is commonly associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats within these regions. Its distribution is closely linked to the ecological diversity of the Amazonian rainforest ecosystem.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abbevillea eugenioides was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in regions with warm, humid climates. It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites, such as roadsides and abandoned fields. This plant is often associated with sandy or loamy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact."
