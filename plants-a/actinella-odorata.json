    "intro": "Actinella odorata, commonly known as the sweet-scented fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that emit a subtle, pleasant fragrance, especially when bruised. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Actinella odorata is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its potential medicinal properties.",
