    "intro": "Alchemilla obovalis, commonly known as narrowleaf lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, erect stems. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. Alchemilla obovalis is often found in moist, shaded woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and medicinal properties."
