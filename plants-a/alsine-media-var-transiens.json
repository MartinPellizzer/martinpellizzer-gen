    "intro": "Alsine media var. transiens, commonly known as the transient alsike clover, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 centimeters and features small, trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its rapid growth and short life cycle make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
