    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon salicifolium is primarily native to Chile Central. It is found in the central regions of Chile, including the Valpara\u00edso and Maule regions. This plant typically grows in coastal areas and dry valleys. It is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon salicifolium was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, streambanks, and open woodlands. This species is often considered an invasive plant due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It thrives in a variety of soil types and can tolerate both full sun and partial shade. Its presence has raised concerns among land managers due to its potential to alter local ecosystems."
