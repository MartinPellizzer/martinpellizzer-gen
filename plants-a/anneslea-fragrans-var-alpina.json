    "intro": "Anneslea fragrans var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine fragrant anneslea, is a rare and delicate plant native to high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family, which includes cashew and poison ivy, and is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers, which are usually white or pale yellow, emit a sweet, aromatic scent that attracts pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
