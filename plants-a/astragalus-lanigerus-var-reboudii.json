It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in alpine ecosystems."
