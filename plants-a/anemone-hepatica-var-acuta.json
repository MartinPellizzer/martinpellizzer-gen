    "intro": "Anemone hepatica var. acuta, commonly known as the sharp-leaved liverwort anemone, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features distinctive heart-shaped leaves that are typically deeply lobed and have a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces showy, early spring blooms in shades of white, pink, or purple, often appearing before the leaves fully unfurl. It thrives in moist, shaded woodland areas and is often found in calcareous soils. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
