    "intro": "Atriplex acanthocarpa subsp. acanthocarpa, commonly known as the spiny saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its gray-green, succulent leaves and spiny, triangular stems that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by edible, salt-tolerant seeds. It thrives in saline soils and is often found in desert scrub and coastal dunes. Its adaptations make it an important component of xerophytic ecosystems."
