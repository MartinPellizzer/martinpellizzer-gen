    "intro": "Anoda paniculata, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps and marshes. The plant features showy, pale blue to purple flower clusters that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. Anoda paniculata is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated soils and its ecological benefits."
