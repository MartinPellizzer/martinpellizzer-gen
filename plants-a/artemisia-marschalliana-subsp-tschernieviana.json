    "intro": "Artemisia marschalliana subsp. tschernieviana, commonly known as the Siberian wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the cold climates of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. It features silvery-gray foliage with finely divided leaves, which are aromatic and emit a strong, camphor-like scent when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and medicinal properties."
