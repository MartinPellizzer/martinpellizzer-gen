    "intro": "Asplenium foresiacum, commonly known as the rock spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It typically grows on rock surfaces or tree bark, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the surrounding environment. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with closely spaced, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, scale-like structures. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves, near the margins. Asplenium foresiacum is a relatively uncommon species, often found in specific microhabitats across tropical and subtropical regions."
