    "intro": "Alopecurus coerulescens, commonly known as blue oat grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green leaves and panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight sheen, while its flowering stems are usually erect and branched. Alopecurus coerulescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
