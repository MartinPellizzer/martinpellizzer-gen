    "intro": "Alchemilla glabra subsp. obtusa, commonly known as narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features silver-green, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the summer, which are borne on slender, upright stalks. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and naturalized landscapes."
