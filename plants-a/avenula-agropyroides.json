    "intro": "Avenula agropyroides, commonly known as the slender oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often slightly hairy, and its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and slightly rolled at the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a loose, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. Avenula agropyroides is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
