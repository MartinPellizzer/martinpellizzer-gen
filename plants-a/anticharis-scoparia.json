    "intro": "Anticharis scoparia, commonly known as the small antirrhinum, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Anticharis scoparia is often found in disturbed habitats, including roadsides and dry grasslands."
