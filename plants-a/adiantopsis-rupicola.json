    "intro": "Adiantopsis rupicola, commonly known as the rock fern, is a delicate and rare species of fern native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green with a silvery underside. This plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Adiantopsis rupicola is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health and is often found in areas with high biodiversity.",
