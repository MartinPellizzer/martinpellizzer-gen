    "intro": "Airopsis lagascae, commonly known as the glass sponge or sea sponges, is a marine organism that belongs to the phylum Porifera. It is characterized by its unique skeletal structure composed of spicules made of silica. These spicules provide structural support and are responsible for its translucent, glass-like appearance. Airopsis lagascae typically inhabits shallow coastal waters and is often found in coral reefs. Its simple body structure and filter-feeding mechanism make it an important part of marine ecosystems."
