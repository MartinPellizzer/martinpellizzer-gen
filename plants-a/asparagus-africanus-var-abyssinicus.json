It is a perennial shrub characterized by its slender, spiny stems and small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, red berries containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climates."
