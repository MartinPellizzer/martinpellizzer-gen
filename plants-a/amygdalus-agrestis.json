    "intro": "Amygdalus agrestis, commonly known as the wild almond or goat's bean, is a deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, hard pods containing edible seeds, which are related to almonds but have a more bitter taste. It thrives in rocky or arid soils and is often found in dry, sunny environments. Amygdalus agrestis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
