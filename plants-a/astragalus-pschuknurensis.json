    "intro": "Astragalus pschuknurensis, commonly known as the Karakorum milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its small, pod-like fruits contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus pschuknurensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
