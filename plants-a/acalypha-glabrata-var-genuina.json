    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha glabrata var. genuina is primarily native to the southern United States, specifically Texas and New Mexico. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. This variety is adapted to thrive in full sun and requires minimal water once established. It is often seen in limestone soils and can tolerate drought conditions. The plant is part of the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its attractive, palmate leaves.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha glabrata var. genuina was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and coastal dunes. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring full sun and well-drained soil. This plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas, making it a common weed in agricultural and urban settings. It has been reported in several countries in the Pacific and Southeast Asia, where it has become naturalized. Due to its adaptability, it is often considered an invasive species in regions where it has been introduced."
