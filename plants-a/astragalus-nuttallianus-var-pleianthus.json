It is characterized by its compound leaves with multiple pairs of leaflets and produces small, yellow to reddish-purple flowers. The plant is typically found in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. It has a deep taproot system, which helps it survive in arid conditions. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in native plant communities."
