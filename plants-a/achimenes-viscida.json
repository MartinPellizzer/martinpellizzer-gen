It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that give it a sticky texture, which helps in deterring herbivores. It thrives in humid, warm environments and is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its ornamental value. Achimenes viscida is typically grown as an annual or tender perennial, requiring well-drained soil and partial shade for optimal growth.",
