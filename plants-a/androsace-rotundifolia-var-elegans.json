It features dense clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has rounded, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine, woolly layer of hair. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
