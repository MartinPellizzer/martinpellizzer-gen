    "intro": "Androstephium breviflorum, commonly known as the short-flowered androstephium, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, and it produces small, dry fruits that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
