    "intro": "Athyrium flexuosum, commonly known as the flexible wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that often form a cascading effect. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fertile fronds bearing spore-producing structures called sori. Its leaves are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a soft, feathery appearance. Athyrium flexuosum thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
