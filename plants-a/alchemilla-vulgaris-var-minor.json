    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. minor, commonly known as lesser lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in loose clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate wet soil conditions."
