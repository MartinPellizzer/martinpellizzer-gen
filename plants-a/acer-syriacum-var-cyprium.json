    "intro": "Acer syriacum var. cyprium, commonly known as the Cyprus maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its palmate leaves that are typically 5-7 lobed, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter underside. The tree produces small, red flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged seeds dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant fall foliage.",
