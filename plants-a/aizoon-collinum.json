    "intro": "Aizoon collinum, commonly known as the rock nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and have a rough, sometimes hairy texture. Aizoon collinum is adapted to thrive in rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
