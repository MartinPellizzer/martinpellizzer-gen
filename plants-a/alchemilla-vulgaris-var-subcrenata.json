    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. subcrenata, commonly known as the silverweed or lesser alchemilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and appear in loose clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Alchemilla vulgaris var. subcrenata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging soil conditions."
