    "intro": "Alopecurus pratensis var. major, commonly known as meadow foxtail, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, spike-like inflorescences that resemble a fox's tail. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained to wet soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
