    "intro": "Anisotes galanae, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a fibrous root system and produces striking, large, white, star-shaped flowers that open at night. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a rough texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. The flowers emit a strong, sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators like moths."
