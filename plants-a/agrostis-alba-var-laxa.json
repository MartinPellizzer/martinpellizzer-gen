    "intro": "Agrostis alba var. laxa, commonly known as silky bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, silky leaves and dense, mat-like growth habit, which allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often found in wet meadows, along stream banks, and in other damp, nutrient-rich soils. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological restoration and wetland habitats."
