    "intro": "Arum hygrophilum var. rupicola, commonly known as the rock arum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves and striking, spadix-bearing inflorescence that resembles a spathe. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in streamside habitats. Its flowers are typically greenish-white with a subtle fragrance, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
