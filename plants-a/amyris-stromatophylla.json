    "intro": "Amyris stromatophylla, commonly known as the Florida sand pine, is a shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, cone-like structures that contain the seeds. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and inland dune environments. Amyris stromatophylla plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
