    "intro": "Achroanthes monophyllos f. diphyllos, commonly known as the two-leaf achroanthes, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its distinct morphological features. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is native to specific regions in South America. The plant is notable for its unusual leaf structure, featuring two distinct leaf forms on the same stem, a trait that sets it apart from other members of its genus. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern.",
