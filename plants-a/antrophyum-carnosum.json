    "intro": "Antrophyum carnosum, commonly known as the fat cycad, is a perennial plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its stout, underground stem and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female flowers, typical of cycads. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Antrophyum carnosum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has historical significance in traditional medicine."
