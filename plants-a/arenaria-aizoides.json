    "intro": "Arenaria aizoides, commonly known as the coastal sandplant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in dune environments where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing sand dunes. The plant has small, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions, and its flowers are typically pink or white, appearing in clusters. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy species in coastal ecosystems. Its ability to colonize disturbed soils makes it an important pioneer species in coastal restoration projects."
