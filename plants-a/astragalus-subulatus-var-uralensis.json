    "intro": "Astragalus subulatus var. uralensis, commonly known as the Ural milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the steppes and forest-steppe regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear small, yellow flowers clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. The leaves are pinnately compound, with finely divided, needle-like leaflets that give the plant a delicate appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, temperate climates. This plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
