    "intro": "Alibrexia rupicola, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Alibrexia rupicola is a hardy species that is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
