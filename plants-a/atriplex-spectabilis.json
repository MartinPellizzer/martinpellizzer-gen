It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in small, salt-excreting glands. The plant thrives in saline and arid environments, making it well adapted to harsh, dry conditions. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine by Indigenous peoples. Atriplex spectabilis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
