    "intro": "Agrostis perennans, commonly known as perennial bentgrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, dark green leaves and forms dense, low-growing turf. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, which helps it spread and establish quickly. Agrostis perennans is also valued for its use in ornamental landscaping and as a forage crop."
