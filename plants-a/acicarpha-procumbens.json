    "intro": "Acicarpha procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate acacia, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems that spread along the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a feathery appearance, which helps in reducing water loss in arid environments. Acicarpha procumbens is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in dryland gardens.",
