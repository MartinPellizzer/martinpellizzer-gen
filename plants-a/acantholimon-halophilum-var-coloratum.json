    "intro": "Acantholimon halophilum var. coloratum, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with silver-gray foliage and showy pink to purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, saline soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salt exposure. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and its ability to stabilize sandy soils in coastal environments.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon halophilum var. coloratum is primarily native to Turkey. This plant is typically found in coastal and saline environments across the country. It thrives in areas with high salinity and well-drained soils. The species is commonly observed in the Aegean and Mediterranean regions of Turkey. Its distribution is closely linked to specific ecological conditions found in these areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon halophilum var. coloratum was mainly introduced to coastal and saline environments in California, particularly in the San Francisco Bay area. It thrives in areas with high salinity and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and tidal marshes. This plant was introduced as a potential vegetation stabilizer to prevent erosion along the coastline. However, its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in these sensitive ecosystems. Its establishment has been documented in several protected and non-protected areas, highlighting the need for monitoring its impact."
