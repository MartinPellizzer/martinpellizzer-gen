    "intro": "Aspalathus inermis, commonly known as the African red bush, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, round berries that contain the seeds. Aspalathus inermis is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native region, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. It is also known for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
