It features opposite, ovate to orbicular leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming in late summer. Its stems are woody and branched, and it is known for its milky sap, which is toxic to livestock. This species is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
