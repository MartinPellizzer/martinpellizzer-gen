    "intro": "Arachniodes dayaoensis, commonly known as the Dayao fern, is a rare and unique species native to China. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lacy fronds that resemble spider webs, giving it its genus name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Its foliage is dark green and glossy, with a distinctive pattern of veins that contribute to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
