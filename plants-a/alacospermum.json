    "intro": "Alacospermum, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. The plants typically have thick, fleshy stems and are often shrubs or small trees. Alacospermum species are adapted to arid environments, making them drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Their flowers are usually small and clustered, with some species displaying vibrant yellow or orange hues."
