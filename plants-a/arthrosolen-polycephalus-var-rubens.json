    "intro": "Arthrosolen polycephalus var. rubens, commonly known as the red-headed tunicate, is a unique marine invertebrate that belongs to the class Ascidiacea. It is characterized by its distinct red coloration and a barrel-shaped body covered in a thick, gelatinous tunic. This species is typically found in coastal waters, where it attaches itself to rocks or other substrates. Its body is segmented into multiple heads, each with a small, protruding oral siphon. The plant-like appearance of this organism has led to its classification within the botanical realm, despite its animal origin."
