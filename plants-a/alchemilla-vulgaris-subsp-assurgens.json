    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris subsp. assurgens, commonly known as silverweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. It has a creeping rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense mats. Silverweed is often used in traditional herbal medicine and as a ground cover in gardens."
