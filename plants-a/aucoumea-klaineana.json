    "intro": "Aucoumea klaineana, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to western and central Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves. The tree produces fragrant, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, red, fleshy fruits. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a commercially important species. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered in many regions."
