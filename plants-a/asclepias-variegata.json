    "intro": "Asclepias variegata, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern and central United States. It features slender, branching stems that produce clusters of showy, pink to reddish-orange flowers. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive variegation of white and green patterns. Its milky sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals but essential for the survival of monarch butterflies. Asclepias variegata plays a vital role in supporting pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native habitat."
