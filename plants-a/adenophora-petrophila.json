    "intro": "Adenophora petrophila, commonly known as the rock bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with a fine, woolly coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Adenophora petrophila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.",
