    "intro": "Astragalus oblatus, commonly known as the broadleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Astragalus oblatus has a taproot system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance."
