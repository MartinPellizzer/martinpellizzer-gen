It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish flowers. The leaves are typically compound, with the terminal leaflet being notably curled or falcate, giving the plant its distinguishing feature.

The plant is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root system."
