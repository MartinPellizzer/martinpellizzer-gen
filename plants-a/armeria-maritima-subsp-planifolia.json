    "intro": "Armeria maritima subsp. planifolia, commonly known as the flat-leaved thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features linear, fleshy leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its salt tolerance and ability to withstand harsh maritime conditions make it a valuable plant for coastal restoration projects."
