    "intro": "Arnica unalaschcensis var. tschonoskyi, commonly known as the Alaska mountain arnica, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Alaska and western Canada. It features a basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers with prominent orange markings, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
