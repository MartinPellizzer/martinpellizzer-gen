    "intro": "Arnica louiseana var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved mountain arnica, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features a hairy, upright stem that can grow up to 60 centimeters tall, adorned with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of yellow-orange flowers with prominent yellow centers, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils in open woodlands. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been historically used for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects."
