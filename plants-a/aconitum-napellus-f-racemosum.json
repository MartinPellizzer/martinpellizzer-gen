    "intro": "Aconitum napellus f. racemosum, commonly known as the Alpine monkshood, is a botanical variant of the common aconite. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers arranged in a raceme, which distinguishes it from the typical cyme of the species. The plant is native to the alpine regions of Europe and thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. Its foliage consists of large, heart-shaped leaves with deeply lobed margins. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens.",
