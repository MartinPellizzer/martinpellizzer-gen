    "intro": "Actinolepis pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaraceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region, where it grows on the branches of hardwood trees. The plant has small, opposite leaves and produces tiny, white to yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are small, fleshy berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it relies on host trees for water and nutrients, making it an important component of forest ecosystems.",
