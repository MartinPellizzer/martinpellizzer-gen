    "intro": "Aquilegia coerulea f. pallidiflora, commonly known as the pale-flowered blue cohosh, is a horticultural form of the blue cohosh plant. It is characterized by its pale blue to white flowers, which contrast with its dark green foliage. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of the western United States and thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils. It produces showy, spurred flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens."
