    "intro": "Armeria alpina var. muelleri, commonly known as the alpine thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has gray-green, needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to withstand harsh climates."
