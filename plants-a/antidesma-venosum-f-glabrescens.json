It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers, followed by fleshy, red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in tropical and subtropical climates."
