    "intro": "Asystasia ammophila, commonly known as beach asystasia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy, saline environments, often found along shores and dunes. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or blue in color, arranged in dense spikes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Asystasia ammophila plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and is sometimes used in landscaping for its hardy nature."
