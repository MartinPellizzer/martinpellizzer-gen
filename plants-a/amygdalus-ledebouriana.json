    "intro": "Amygdalus ledebouriana, commonly known as the desert peach, is a small, deciduous tree native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lance-shaped leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces fragrant white flowers in spring, followed by edible, almond-like fruits. It is highly drought-tolerant and adapted to poor soil conditions, making it well-suited for arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is cultivated in xeriscapes and botanical gardens."
