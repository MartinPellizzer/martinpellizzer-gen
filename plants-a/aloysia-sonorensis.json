    "intro": "Aloysia sonorensis, commonly known as desert verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically blooms in shades of violet or blue, producing nectar that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Aloysia sonorensis is well adapted to hot, dry environments and has a deep root system to access groundwater. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
