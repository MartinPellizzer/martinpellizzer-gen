    "intro": "Aristida stricta var. beyrichiana, commonly known as the narrowleaf threeawn, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a ornamental grass in xeriscaped gardens."
