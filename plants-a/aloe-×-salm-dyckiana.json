It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it store water. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow or orange flowers, often blooming in summer. Its hybrid origin results from crosses between Aloe vera and Aloe aristata, giving it unique characteristics. It is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes and has some medicinal uses."
