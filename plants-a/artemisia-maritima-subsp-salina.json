It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and is adapted to saline and sandy environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and salt marshes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control in coastal areas."
