    "intro": "Aegopogon geminiflorus var. abortivus, commonly known as the abortive twin-flower, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the twin-flower plant. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands or stream sides, and is native to parts of eastern North America. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and the flowers are usually white or pale green, arranged in dense umbels. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often overlooked in botanical studies."
