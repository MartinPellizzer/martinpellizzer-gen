    "intro": "Ambavia gerrardi, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers that resemble bells, with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. Its growth habit is typically epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Ambavia gerrardi is considered a conservation concern."
