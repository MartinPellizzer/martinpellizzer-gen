    "intro": "Avena sterilis var. pseudovilis, commonly known as goat grass, is a wild cereal grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. While not cultivated for grain, it has been studied for its potential in ecological restoration and as a source of forage for livestock."
