    "intro": "Arthraxon ciliaris var. centrasiaticus, commonly known as the Central Asian arrowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish or brownish spikelets that are arranged in dense clusters along the stem. It is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated for erosion control in agricultural settings."
