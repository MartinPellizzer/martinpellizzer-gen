It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark-barked trunk and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense tropical forests. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
