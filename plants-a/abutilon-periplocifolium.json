    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon periplocifolium is primarily native to South America, specifically the Andean regions of Peru and Ecuador. It is commonly found in the high-altitude grasslands and shrublands of these areas. This plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with rocky or mountainous terrain. Its native distribution is limited to these specific geographic locations within the continent.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon periplocifolium was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habits. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites where it can thrive in a variety of soil types. However, it is not considered invasive and has minimal impact on native ecosystems."
