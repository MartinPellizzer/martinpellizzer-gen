    "intro": "Avena uniflora, commonly known as slender oat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, white or pale blue flowers. Avena uniflora is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and its ecological benefits."
