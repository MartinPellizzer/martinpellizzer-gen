    "intro": "Andropogon miliformis, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and southeastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of 2 to 4 feet. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are characteristic of the grass family. Its roots form dense networks, making it a valuable plant for soil stabilization and erosion control. It is also used in restoration projects due to its adaptability and ecological benefits."
