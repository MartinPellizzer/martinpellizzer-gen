    "intro": "Astragalus efoliatus, commonly known as the leafless milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its absence of leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through its stems and flowers. The plant produces small, yellow to green pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to survive in dry, rocky soils. Astragalus efoliatus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
