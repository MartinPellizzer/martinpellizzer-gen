    "intro": "Apera spica-venti subsp. maritima, commonly known as beach grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that are adapted to withstand wind and salt spray. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along shorelines and dunes. Its rhizomatous growth habit helps stabilize dunes and prevent erosion. It plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat for various organisms."
