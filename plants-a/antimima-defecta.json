    "intro": "Antimima defecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in cool, moist environments. It is characterized by its delicate, crust-like growth form and is typically found on bark, stones, or soil surfaces. The plant's thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the environment. It has a limited geographic distribution, primarily in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for air quality and ecological health."
