It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers. The plant is well adapted to harsh maritime conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and cliffs. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in coastal gardens."
