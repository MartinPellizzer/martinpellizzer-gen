    "intro": "Arabis caespitosa, commonly known as the clustered rockcress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to Europe and western Asia and typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant forms compact, low-growing clusters with basal leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss. Arabis caespitosa is often used in rock gardens and alpine settings due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
