    "intro": "Aerangis macrocentra, commonly known as the large-flowered orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink with a yellow lip. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. The species is prized for its ornamental value in horticulture."
