    "intro": "Abies ajanensis, commonly known as the Ajanensis fir, is a species of conifer native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged spirally along the branches. The tree produces small, spherical cones that are typically reddish-brown in color and contain winged seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude forests. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited commercial use due to its rarity and restricted habitat.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies ajanensis is primarily native to the mountainous regions of eastern China, particularly in the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan. It grows in high-altitude forests at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 3,800 meters above sea level. This species is commonly found in areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils. It is part of the natural vegetation of the Hengduan Mountains, where it contributes to the biodiversity of the region. The plant is also occasionally found in adjacent areas of northern Myanmar and northern Vietnam.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies ajanensis was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and high elevations, particularly in mountainous areas of East Asia. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires ample sunlight for optimal growth. This species is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as an ornamental tree due to its aesthetic value. Its introduction has been limited to specific areas where its ecological requirements are met. However, it is not widely naturalized outside its native range."
