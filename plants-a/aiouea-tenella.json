    "intro": "Aiouea tenella, commonly known as the Hainan ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to southern China and the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, dark-barked trunk. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often clustered together, followed by spherical, woody fruits. Aiouea tenella is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in traditional construction and furniture-making. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests."
