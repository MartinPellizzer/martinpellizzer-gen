    "intro": "Andryala pinnatifida f. teydensis, commonly known as the Teyden's broadleaf andryala, is a variant of the Andryala pinnatifida species, characterized by its distinctive pinnately compound leaves. This plant is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills, where it thrives in moist, temperate climates. Its leaves are typically broad and serrated, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It is often found in shaded, humid environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
