    "intro": "Adenanthera polita, commonly known as the silky oaks or blue oaks, is a deciduous tree native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pale blue to white flowers. The tree produces flat, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds, which are often used in traditional Indigenous Australian diets. Its wood is hard and durable, making it valuable for construction and furniture-making. The plant also plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation.",
