    "intro": "Armeria caespitosa var. isernii, commonly known as the Isern's tufted thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hair, giving it a silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy and drought-tolerant nature."
