It is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of brown, hairy structures. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are arranged in a distinctive, fan-like pattern."
