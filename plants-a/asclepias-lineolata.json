It is native to the United States and is characterized by its showy, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. Its latex sap is milky and toxic, containing cardenolides that are harmful to many animals.
