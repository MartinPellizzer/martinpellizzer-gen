    "intro": "Aotus ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty leaf orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers that often feature a mix of red, orange, and yellow hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its leaves are usually broad and slightly hairy, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat.
