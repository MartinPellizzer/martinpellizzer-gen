    "intro": "Acanthophippium lilacinum, commonly known as the lilac-flowered acanthophippium, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its showy, lilac-colored bracts that surround small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or subshrub, with woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species in desert environments. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.",

This plant is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, particularly in lowland and hill forest areas. It thrives in humid and shaded environments, often growing on the forest floor or as an understory plant. The species is known for its striking lilac-colored flowers, which attract various pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthophippium lilacinum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, showy flowers. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its spread is often facilitated by its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its prolific seed production. Conservation efforts are now focused on controlling its spread and protecting local ecosystems."
