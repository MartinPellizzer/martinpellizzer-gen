    "intro": "Arachniodes elevatas, commonly known as the broadleaf holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features large, leathery, dark green fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense clumps. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal and texture. It prefers shady, moist environments and is relatively easy to care for in humid conditions."
