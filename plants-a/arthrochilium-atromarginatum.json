    "intro": "Arthrochilium atromarginatum, commonly known as the black-margin orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its unique feature is the dark brown or black margins on the petals and sepals, which give it its common name. Arthrochilium atromarginatum is a relatively rare species, often found in specific microhabitats with high humidity and well-drained soil."
