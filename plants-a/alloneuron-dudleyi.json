    "intro": "Alloneuron dudleyi, commonly known as the Dudley's alloneuron, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, also known as the legume or pea family, characterized by its pod-like fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations such as small, waxy leaves to reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, often in shades of pink or purple, and it produces seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
