    "intro": "Arenaria grisebachii, commonly known as the pink sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the carnation family, Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or alpine environments. Its leaves are usually succulent and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
