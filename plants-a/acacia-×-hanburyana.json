    "intro": "Acacia \u00d7 hanburyana, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a hybrid plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in reforestation efforts.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia \u00d7 hanburyana is primarily native to northern Australia, specifically the Northern Territory and Queensland. It is found in regions with a tropical climate, including the Kimberley and Cape York Peninsula. This hybrid species occurs in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and inland woodlands. It is commonly found in areas with a mix of open and dense vegetation. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones where its parent species, Acacia species, naturally occur.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia \u00d7 hanburyana was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Acacia dealbata and Acacia longifolia. This plant was introduced for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in various environmental conditions. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to its classification as a potential environmental weed in certain regions."
