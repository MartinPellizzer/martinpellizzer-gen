It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. It has slender, branching stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments.",
