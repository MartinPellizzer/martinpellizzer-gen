    "intro": "Airella praecox, commonly known as early marsh orchid, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in temperate regions. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing clusters of pale yellow or greenish-white blooms. Airella praecox thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
