    "intro": "Anisantha madritensis subsp. haussknechtii, commonly known as the Peruvian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a rough texture, and it is adapted to high-altitude environments. This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
