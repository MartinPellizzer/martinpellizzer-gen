    "intro": "Asclepias maritima, commonly known as coastal milkweed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the United States and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are pollinated by various insects, including bees and butterflies. Its latex sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals but essential for the survival of monarch butterflies. Asclepias maritima thrives in sandy or muddy soils along shorelines and is adapted to withstand salt spray and tidal flooding."
