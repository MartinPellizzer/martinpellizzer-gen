    "intro": "Armeria arenaria subsp. marginata, commonly known as the sandverbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of western Europe. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and rocky coastal habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscaping."
