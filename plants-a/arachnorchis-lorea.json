    "intro": "Arachnorchis lorea, commonly known as the golden spider-orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its striking yellow and green flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes and absorbing moisture from the air. Its flowers bloom in spring, often in clusters of 3 to 5, and are pollinated by insects. The species is listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
