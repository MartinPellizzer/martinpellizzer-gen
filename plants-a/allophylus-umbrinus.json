    "intro": "Allophylus umbrinus, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a flowering plant species native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is a small tree or shrub that thrives in brackish water environments, often found in mangrove ecosystems. The plant has dark, almost black bark and produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture, adapted to withstand salt spray and tidal conditions. Allophylus umbrinus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
