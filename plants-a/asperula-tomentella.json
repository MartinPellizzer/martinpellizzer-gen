    "intro": "Asperula tomentella, commonly known as the woolly woodrush, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Asperula tomentella thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a popular choice for erosion control."
