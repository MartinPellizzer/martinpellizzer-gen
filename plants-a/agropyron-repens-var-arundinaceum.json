    "intro": "Agropyron repens var. arundinaceum, commonly known as creeping wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, lawns, and along roadsides. This variety is valued for its erosion control capabilities and as a forage crop for livestock."
