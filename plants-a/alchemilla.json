    "intro": "Alchemilla, commonly known as lady's mantle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rosaceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are often covered in a fine, silvery or whitish down, which gives them a distinctive appearance. Alchemilla species are typically perennial and thrive in moist, well-drained soils. They are native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America."
