    "intro": "Aloe lingua var. crassifolia, commonly known as the thick-leaved aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy, upright leaves that are often ribbed and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The leaves are typically green with a bluish tint and may bear small white spots or teeth along the edges. It produces yellow flowers in racemes during the summer months, which are attractive to pollinators. This species is well-suited for arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
