    "intro": "Acetosella meisneri, commonly known as the Meisner's sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Its leaves contain oxalic acid, which gives them a sour taste, and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Acetosella meisneri is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is cultivated in some horticultural gardens.",
