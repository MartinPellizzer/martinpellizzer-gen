    "intro": "Andinorchis heteroclita, commonly known as the Andean orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and adaptation to cold, mountainous environments. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has a compact growth habit with a pseudobulb that stores nutrients and water. Its flowers are often pale green or yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
