It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, depending on the variety. Its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant blooms. Azalea setosa thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
