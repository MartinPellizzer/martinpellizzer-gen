It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like blades that often curl at the tips. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and restoration projects."
