    "intro": "Androsace carinata, commonly known as the carinate rock-moss, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
