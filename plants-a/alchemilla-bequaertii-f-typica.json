    "intro": "Alchemilla bequaertii f. typica, commonly known as the typical form of the alpine lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Alchemilla bequaertii f. typica is often used in rock gardens and alpine displays due to its ornamental foliage and hardy nature."
