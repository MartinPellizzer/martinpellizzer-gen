    "intro": "Aspidium basilare, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in freshwater habitats such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant has a delicate, floating frond structure with a short, creeping rhizome that anchors it to the substrate. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with small, rounded lobes that help it capture light and float on the water's surface. Aspidium basilare plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing shelter for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water quality through nutrient cycling."
