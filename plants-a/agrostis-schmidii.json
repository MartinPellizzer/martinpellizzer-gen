    "intro": "Agrostis schmidii, commonly known as Schmid's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and for erosion control."
