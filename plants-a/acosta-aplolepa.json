It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in terminal panicles. Its seeds are encased in hard, spiny pods that split open when mature. Acosta aplolepa is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings.",
