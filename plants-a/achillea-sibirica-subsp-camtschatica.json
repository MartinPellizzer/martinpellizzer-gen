It features a robust root system and upright, branched stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped inflorescences. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.",
