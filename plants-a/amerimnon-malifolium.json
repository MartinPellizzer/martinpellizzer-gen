    "intro": "Amerimnon malifolium, commonly known as the Blackleaf Nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of South America. It features dark green, velvety leaves that are oval in shape and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from purple to deep violet, typically blooming in late spring. Its berries are toxic and contain high concentrations of solanine, making them dangerous if ingested. Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value in shaded garden settings."
