    "intro": "Aloe asperula, commonly known as the rough aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a waxy coating and have a rough, textured surface. The leaves are typically blue-green in color and can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. It produces yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are borne on a tall, erect stem. This plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments."
