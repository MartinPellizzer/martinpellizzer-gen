    "intro": "Asplenium rupium, commonly known as the rock spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in rocky or shaded environments. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and slightly curled. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, which it produces in specialized structures called sporangia. Asplenium rupium is often found growing on limestone or other calcareous substrates, making it a common indicator species in such habitats."
