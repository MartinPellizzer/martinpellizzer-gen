It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are often narrow and slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, spike-like flowers, which are usually greenish or brownish in color.
