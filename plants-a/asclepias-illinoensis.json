    "intro": "Asclepias illinoensis, commonly known as Illinois milkweed, is a native perennial plant found primarily in the central United States. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milkweed sap contains latex, which is toxic to some animals but essential for the survival of monarch butterflies. Illinois milkweed plays a vital role in supporting pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native habitat."
