It features erect, branching stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, making it one of the tallest milkweed species. The plant produces clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers with prominent, hood-like structures and reflexed petals. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and often have a bluish-green hue. This species is notable for its role as a host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and its ability to thrive in arid environments."
