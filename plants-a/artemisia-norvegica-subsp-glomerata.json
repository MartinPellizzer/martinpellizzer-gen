It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in mountainous regions. The plant has finely divided, gray-green foliage with a strong aromatic scent. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense, spherical heads, which give it its subspecific name \"glomerata.\" It is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
