    "intro": "Aconitum naviculare var. leiocarpum, commonly known as the smooth-carpelled monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking blue to purple flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape, characteristic of the genus Aconitum. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a distinct basal rosette and possesses a deep root system that helps it thrive in rocky and well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.",
