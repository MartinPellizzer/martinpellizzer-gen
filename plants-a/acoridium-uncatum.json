    "intro": "Acoridium uncatum, commonly known as the slender swamp lily, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Acoraceae family and is characterized by its narrow, strap-like leaves and small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, adapting to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, though its botanical significance lies in its ecological role within wetland ecosystems. Acoridium uncatum is an important indicator species for the health of freshwater habitats.",
