    "intro": "Aloe deinacantha, commonly known as the rock aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellow-orange flowers, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its leaves can be used to create a gel similar to other aloe species, though it is less commonly used for medicinal purposes."
