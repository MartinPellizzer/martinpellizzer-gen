    "intro": "Acrostichum gracile, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help it spread across moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Acrostichum gracile thrives in humid climates and is often found in forest understories or near water sources.",
