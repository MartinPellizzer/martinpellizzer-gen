    "intro": "Acalypha rugosa, commonly known as roughleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves and clusters of small, pink to red flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. The species is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha rugosa is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is also found in parts of tropical regions in Africa and the Pacific Islands. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks. It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest ecosystems. Its distribution is closely linked to humid tropical climates with high rainfall.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha rugosa was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowering habits. It is commonly found in gardens and as a landscape plant in countries such as Australia, New Zealand, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its vibrant color and unique leaf patterns. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas where it can outcompete native vegetation. Its distribution is largely anthropogenic, spread through cultivation and accidental introduction."
