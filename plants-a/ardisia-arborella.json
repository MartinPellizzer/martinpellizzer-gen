    "intro": "Ardisia arborella, commonly known as the evergreen ardisia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom throughout the year. After flowering, it produces bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Ardisia arborella is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
