    "intro": "Alsophila trichophlebia, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a fibrous, hairy coating that gives it its common name. The plant produces large, frond-like leaves that grow in a spiral pattern around the trunk. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing cones, are typically found at the top of the plant. Alsophila trichophlebia thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
