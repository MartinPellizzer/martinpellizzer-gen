    "intro": "Artemisia grenardii, commonly known as Grenard's wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, aromatic foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has silvery-white leaves with a strong, pungent scent, often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Artemisia grenardii is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
