    "intro": "Acronia baccata, commonly known as the red-fruited acronia, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. These fruits are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Acronia baccata is often found in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade.",
