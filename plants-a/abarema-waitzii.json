    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abarema waitzii is primarily native to Brazil. It is found in the states of Par\u00e1, Piau\u00ed, and Pernambuco. This species grows in tropical and subtropical regions, typically in moist forests and along riverbanks. It is adapted to humid climates with well-drained soils. The plant is part of the legume family and plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema waitzii was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping. It is commonly found in disturbed areas, including roadsides and urban environments. This plant has adapted well to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a potential invasive species in some regions. However, its distribution remains largely localized to areas where it has been intentionally or accidentally introduced."
