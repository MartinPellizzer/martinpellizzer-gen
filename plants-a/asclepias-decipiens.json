    "intro": "Asclepias decipiens, commonly known as the mimic milkweed, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the milkweed family, Asclepiadaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that resemble those of other milkweed species. The plant produces small, green, oval-shaped pods that contain seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a hairy texture, while its stem is erect and often branching. Asclepias decipiens plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae."
