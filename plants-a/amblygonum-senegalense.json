It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing several seeds. It has a woody stem and narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss. Amblygonum senegalense is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
