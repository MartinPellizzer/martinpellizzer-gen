    "intro": "Asclepias macroura, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap, which contains toxic compounds that deter herbivores. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture. Asclepias macroura serves as a vital host plant for the monarch butterfly, supporting the life cycle of this iconic species."
