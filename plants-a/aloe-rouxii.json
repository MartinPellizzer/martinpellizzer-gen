    "intro": "Aloe rouxii, commonly known as the St. Helena aloe, is a succulent plant native to the island of St. Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick, fleshy, and covered in a white powdery coating called bloom. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellow flowers, which bloom in late winter or early spring. Aloe rouxii is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
