    "intro": "Asplenium lunulatum var. angustius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern family (Aspleniaceae). It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its finely divided, dark green, leathery fronds that are typically narrow and elongated. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in humid conditions."
