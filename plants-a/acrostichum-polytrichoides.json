    "intro": "Acrostichum polytrichoides, commonly known as the giant swamp fern, is a large, aquatic fern native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in wetland environments, often found in swamps and along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant has long, arching fronds that can grow up to 6 feet in length, with a distinctive, feather-like structure. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This species plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms.",
