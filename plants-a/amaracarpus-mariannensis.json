    "intro": "Amaracarpus mariannensis, commonly known as the Mariana sandalwood, is a rare and endemic tree species native to the tropical regions of the Mariana Islands. It belongs to the family Santalaceae and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers and woody, aromatic heartwood. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from other plants through specialized root structures. It typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the unique soil and climate conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a critically endangered species."
