    "intro": "Antiphytum bornmuelleri, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its unique, translucent leaves that resemble ghostly veils, giving it its common name. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is often found in protected areas and is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
