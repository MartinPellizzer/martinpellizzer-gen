    "intro": "Argemone parva, commonly known as the small prickly poppy, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its small, yellow-orange flowers and hairy, spiny stems. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
