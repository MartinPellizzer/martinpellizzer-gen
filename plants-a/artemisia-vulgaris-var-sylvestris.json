    "intro": "Artemisia vulgaris var. sylvestris, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, silvery-green foliage and small yellow flowers that appear in late summer. The plant is often found in dry, disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. It has a strong, bitter scent due to the presence of volatile oils, which contribute to its historical use in medicine and as a vermifuge. This variety is closely related to other members of the Asteraceae family and is known for its resilience and adaptability."
