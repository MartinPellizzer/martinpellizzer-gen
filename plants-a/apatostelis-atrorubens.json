    "intro": "Apatostelis atrorubens, commonly known as the red-black scale, is a species of scale insect belonging to the family Coccidae. It is characterized by its distinctive dark red to black body coloration, which provides effective camouflage on host plants. This insect primarily infests a variety of plants, including ornamental and fruit-bearing species, feeding on plant sap. Its life cycle involves several nymphal stages, with adults typically remaining sessile on the host plant. The plant's botanical significance lies in its role as a host for this pest, influencing agricultural and horticultural practices."
