    "intro": "Aira alpina f. planifolia, commonly known as the flat-leaved alpine airgrass, is a variant of the alpine airgrass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its narrow, flat, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in dense, tufted clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its delicate structure, it is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds typical of its environment."
