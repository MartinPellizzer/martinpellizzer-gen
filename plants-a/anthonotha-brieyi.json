    "intro": "Anthonotha brieyi, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with a low, sprawling growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by small, capsule-like fruits that release tiny seeds. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Anthonotha brieyi is adapted to survive in harsh environments with limited water availability."
