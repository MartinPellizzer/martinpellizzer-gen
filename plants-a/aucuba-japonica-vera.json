    "intro": "Aucuba japonica vera, commonly known as Japanese aucuba, is a broadleaf evergreen shrub native to Japan and Korea. It features dark green, glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are often variegated with yellow or white margins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is well-suited for woodland gardens or as a foundation plant. Aucuba japonica vera is valued for its hardiness, low maintenance, and ornamental foliage throughout the year."
