    "intro": "Avena spica-venti, commonly known as the wind grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are adapted for wind pollination. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as fields and roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a smooth surface that helps reduce water loss. Avena spica-venti is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
