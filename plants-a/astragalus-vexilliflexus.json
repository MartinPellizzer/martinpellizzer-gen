It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation. Its unique floral structure and adaptability make it a notable species in its native habitat."
