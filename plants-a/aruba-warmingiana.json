    "intro": "Aruba warmingiana, commonly known as the Aruba starling tree, is a unique flowering plant native to the island of Aruba. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling stars, hence its common name. The plant has a woody stem and produces small, oval-shaped fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in arid and coastal environments, adapting well to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
