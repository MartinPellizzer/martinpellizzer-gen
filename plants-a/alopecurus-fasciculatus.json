    "intro": "Alopecurus fasciculatus, commonly known as mouse grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Alopecurus fasciculatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
