    "intro": "Appendicula annamensis, commonly known as the Annamese appendicula, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Vietnam. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils at high altitudes. Its botanical features include a short, upright stem and a unique reproductive structure known as a capitulum. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered an endangered species."
