    "intro": "Aralia elata var. canescens, commonly known as the white aralia, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features compound leaves that are typically pinnately arranged, with a silvery-white underside that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters, which are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage and unique fruiting display."
