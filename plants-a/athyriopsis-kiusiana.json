    "intro": "Athyriopsis kiusiana, commonly known as the Kiusian shield fern, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that resemble those of a shield. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats, often in forest understories where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its small, clustered spore-bearing structures are located on the underside of its fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare species with conservation concerns."
