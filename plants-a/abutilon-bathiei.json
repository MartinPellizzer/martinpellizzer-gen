    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon bathiei is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Bahamas. It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests where it thrives in humid, tropical conditions. This plant is often associated with sandy or rocky soils along the shorelines. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for local wildlife. Due to its ornamental value, it has also been introduced to other regions outside its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon bathiei was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers. It was first brought there in the late 19th century by European settlers who admired its unique appearance. Despite its aesthetic value, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Its rapid spread has led to increased management efforts to control its impact on native flora."
