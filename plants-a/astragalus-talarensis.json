It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions. Astragalus talarensis is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
