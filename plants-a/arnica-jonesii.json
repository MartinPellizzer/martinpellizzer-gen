    "intro": "Arnica jonesii, commonly known as Jones' arnica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow-orange flower heads and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Arnica jonesii is valued for its medicinal properties, though it is often used in tinctures and topical applications for its anti-inflammatory effects."
