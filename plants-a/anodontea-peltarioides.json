    "intro": "Anodontea peltarioides, commonly known as the peltate liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Peltate. It is characterized by its rosette-like growth pattern and the presence of peltate thallus, which is a flat, leaf-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia. Anodontea peltarioides plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms."
