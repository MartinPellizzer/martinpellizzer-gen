    "intro": "Avena corymbosa, commonly known as the clustered oat, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, erect stems that bear dense clusters of small, spikelet-like flowers, typically arranged in panicles. The plant produces slender, cylindrical spikelets that are often tinged with red or purple, adding to its ornamental value. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Avena corymbosa is valued in horticulture for its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators."
