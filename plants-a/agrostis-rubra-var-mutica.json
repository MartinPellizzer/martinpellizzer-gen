    "intro": "Agrostis rubra var. mutica, commonly known as red hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted culms with dense, dark green foliage that turns reddish in the autumn. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, pale green to reddish spikelets. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small invertebrates."
