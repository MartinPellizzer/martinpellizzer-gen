    "intro": "Agapetes, commonly known as the snowbell or white bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the heath family (Ericaceae). These evergreen shrubs are native to the temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere, particularly in South America, Africa, and southern Asia. They are characterized by their small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and their leathery, glossy leaves. Agapetes species often grow in moist, shaded environments, such as mountain forests and cloud forests. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in cool, humid conditions."
