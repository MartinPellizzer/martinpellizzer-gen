The plant typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 meters, with a rounded canopy and delicate, branching structure. Its leaves are palmately lobed, often with finely serrated edges, and it produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in early spring. Acer distylum prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping.",
