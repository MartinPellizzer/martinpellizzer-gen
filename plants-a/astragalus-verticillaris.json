    "intro": "Astragalus verticillaris, commonly known as the whorled milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, arranged in clusters. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus verticillaris is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
