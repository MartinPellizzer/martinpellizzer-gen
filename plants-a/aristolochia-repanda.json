    "intro": "Aristolochia repanda, commonly known as the broadleaf Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, aromatic leaves and unique, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, often unpleasant odor. The plant belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is known for its complex, winding flowers that resemble a pipe, hence its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. However, it contains toxic compounds and is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
