    "intro": "Aspalathus simii, commonly known as the African red bush, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and clusters of small, red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for coastal and sandy environments. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral display. Aspalathus simii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience to drought and salt spray."
