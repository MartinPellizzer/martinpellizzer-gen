    "intro": "Astragalus rawlinsianus, commonly known as the Rawlinsian milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish to brownish pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and its root system is extensive, adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils. It is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions."
