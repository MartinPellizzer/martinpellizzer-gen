    "intro": "Azorella diversifolia var. antillanca, commonly known as the Antillean Azorella, is a perennial cushion plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosette of fleshy, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles during the summer months. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, it is an important component of the alpine flora in its native range."
