    "intro": "Androsace eritrichioides, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, usually blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in high-altitude meadows and tundra environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens with similar growing conditions."
