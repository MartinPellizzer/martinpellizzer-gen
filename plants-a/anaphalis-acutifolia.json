    "intro": "Anaphalis acutifolia, commonly known as the sharp-leaved goatweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, fluffy inflorescences that resemble clouds, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, pale yellow flowers that are often clustered together in spherical or cylindrical shapes. It is adapted to survive in dry environments, with hairy leaves that reduce water loss. Anaphalis acutifolia is often found in rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
