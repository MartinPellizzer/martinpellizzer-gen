    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa subsp. barbata, commonly known as the sticky alder, is a shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and the presence of sticky resin on its bark and young shoots. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by winged fruits that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges or stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and habitat provision for various wildlife species."
