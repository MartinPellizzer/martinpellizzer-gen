    "intro": "Agasthiyamalaia pauciflora, commonly known as the Nilgiri mallow, is a flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its hairy, herbaceous stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the monsoon season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
