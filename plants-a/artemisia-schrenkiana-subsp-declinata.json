    "intro": "Artemisia schrenkiana subsp. declinata, commonly known as the Afghan tarragon, is a perennial shrub native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its essential oils, which give it a distinctive herbaceous scent, are used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. The subspecies is distinguished by its drooping inflorescences and narrower leaves compared to other Artemisia species."
