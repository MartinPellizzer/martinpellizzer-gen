    "intro": "Armeriastrum caryophyllaceum, commonly known as the coastal sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in full sun. It produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit and ability to withstand salt spray make it well adapted to coastal environments."
