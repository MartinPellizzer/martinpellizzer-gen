    "intro": "Abies procera f. glauca, commonly known as the blue spruce, is a variant of the white spruce native to western North America. It is characterized by its striking blue-gray foliage, which results from a dense layer of wax on the leaf surfaces. The plant has a conical shape with upward-curving branches, and its needles are typically four to five millimeters long. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular ornamental tree in gardens and landscapes. The species is also valued for its durability and resistance to pests and diseases.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies procera f. glauca is primarily native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is found in high elevation areas, particularly in the Sierra Nevada, Cascade, and Rocky Mountain ranges. This subspecies thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils. It is commonly associated with subalpine and alpine forests. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones where it can tolerate the harsh climatic conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies procera f. glauca was mainly introduced to enhance the aesthetic value of landscapes and provide a unique ornamental feature in gardens and parks. This variety is known for its striking blue-gray foliage, which offers a distinct visual appeal compared to the typical green needles of the species. It has been cultivated in regions with temperate climates where it can thrive in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The introduction of this form has expanded the range of available fir species for horticultural use. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in native environments."
