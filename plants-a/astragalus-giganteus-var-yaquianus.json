    "intro": "Astragalus giganteus var. yaquianus, commonly known as the Yaquian milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and pinnately compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species in dry, rocky habitats. Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia makes it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor environments."
