    "intro": "Aloe cipolinicola, commonly known as the Cipoli aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces striking yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It is well adapted to full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
