    "intro": "Armeria pubigera var. glaberrima, commonly known as the glabrous thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features dense clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardens."
