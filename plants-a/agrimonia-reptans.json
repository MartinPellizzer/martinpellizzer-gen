    "intro": "Agrimonia reptans, commonly known as creeping agrimony, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant has small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges and are covered in fine hairs. Agrimonia reptans is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides."
