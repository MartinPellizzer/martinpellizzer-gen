    "intro": "Acacia ungulata, commonly known as the clawed acacia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in globular inflorescences, which are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments. Acacia ungulata is also valued for its hard, durable wood and has been used traditionally for various purposes.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia ungulata is primarily native to eastern Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria. It is commonly found in dry sclerophyll forests and woodland communities. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with rocky outcrops and hill country. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for native wildlife. Acacia ungulata is also known for its distinctive, spiny pods and is a characteristic component of the local flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia ungulata was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in sandy soils along the coastal areas and in the fynbos biome. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. However, it can also pose a threat to native vegetation by outcompeting local species. Its introduction has led to both ecological benefits and challenges in some areas."
