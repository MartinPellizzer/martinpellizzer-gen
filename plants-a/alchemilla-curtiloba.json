    "intro": "Alchemilla curtiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in loose panicles. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla curtiloba is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
