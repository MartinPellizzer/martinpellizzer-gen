    "intro": "Agelanthus irangensis, commonly known as the Irangensis cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Indonesia. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, trunk-like stem and large, pinnate leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, which is a notable feature in its reproductive biology. Its cones, which are the reproductive structures, are typically found on separate plants and are essential for seed production. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Agelanthus irangensis is considered a critically endangered species."
