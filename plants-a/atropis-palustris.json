The plant has upright stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, covered with coarse, hairy foliage. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with serrated edges and a bluish-green color, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a dense, globular head. Atropis palustris plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
