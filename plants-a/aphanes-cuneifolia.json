It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. Aphanes cuneifolia thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. It is an important plant in ecological studies due to its role in soil stabilization and its ability to colonize harsh environments."
