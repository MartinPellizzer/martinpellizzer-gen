    "intro": "Aconitum toxicum, commonly known as the western aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafed stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a spikelike inflorescence. Its roots and rhizomes contain potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic to both humans and animals. Due to its toxicity, it is often referred to as \"monkshood\" because of the shape of its helmet-like flowers.",
