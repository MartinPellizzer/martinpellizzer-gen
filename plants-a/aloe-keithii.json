    "intro": "Aloe keithii, commonly known as Keith's aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, upright stems that are often branched and covered in a layer of white powder. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by small, red berries. Its leaves are thick and ribbed, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. Aloe keithii is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
