    "intro": "Angraecum arachnopus, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its intricate, spider-like appearance, with long, slender petals and a unique, elongated spur. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil to prevent root rot. Its flowering period typically occurs during the wet season, producing delicate white or pale pink blooms. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
