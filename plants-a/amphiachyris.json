    "intro": "Amphiachyris, commonly known as the coastal sandplant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Aizoaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly found in coastal regions with sandy soils. The plants are characterized by their small, succulent leaves and vibrant, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Amphiachyris species are often used in coastal landscaping due to their ability to thrive in harsh, saline environments. They play an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in their native habitats."
