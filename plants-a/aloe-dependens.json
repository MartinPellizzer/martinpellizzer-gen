    "intro": "Aloe dependens, commonly known as the hanging aloe or weeping aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features long, drooping leaves that hang from the stem, giving it a unique appearance. The leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. It produces yellow flowers in clusters at the end of its stems, typically during the summer months. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens or as a potted plant due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements."
