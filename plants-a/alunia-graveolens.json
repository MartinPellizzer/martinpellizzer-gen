    "intro": "Alunia graveolens, commonly known as the stinkwood tree, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood that emits a strong, unpleasant odor when cut. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by small, round fruits. Alunia graveolens is valued for its hard, durable wood used in construction and furniture, despite its strong scent. It also plays an important ecological role in its native habitats."
