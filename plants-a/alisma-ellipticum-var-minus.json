    "intro": "Alisma ellipticum var. minus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 2 cm wide, adapted for aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps it spread and colonize wetland habitats. This variant is often distinguished from the typical form by its narrower leaves and smaller stature."
