    "intro": "Avena sativa var. setulosa, commonly known as the hairy oat, is a variety of the common oat plant characterized by its hairy foliage and stems. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in temperate climates, often found in meadows and along roadsides. The plant produces slender, cylindrical spikelets that bear small, two-lobed flowers. Its fibrous roots make it a valuable plant for soil stabilization and erosion control. The hairy texture of its leaves and stems distinguishes it from other oat varieties and contributes to its unique ecological role."
