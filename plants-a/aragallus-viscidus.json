    "intro": "Aragallus viscidus, commonly known as the sticky aragallus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often swollen nodes. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that produce a sticky substance, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters and are typically pollinated by insects. Aragallus viscidus is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
