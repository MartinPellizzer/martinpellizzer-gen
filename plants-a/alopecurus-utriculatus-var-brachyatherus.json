    "intro": "Alopecurus utriculatus var. brachyatherus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mouse-ear, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, grassy areas such as meadows, ditches, and woodland edges. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its roots are fibrous and often form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. This variety is often found in disturbed sites and is considered a characteristic species of certain habitat types."
