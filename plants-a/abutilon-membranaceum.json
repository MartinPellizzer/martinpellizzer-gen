    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon membranaceum is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is commonly found in areas such as Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. It is known for its distinctive, velvety leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers. Abutilon membranaceum is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon membranaceum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, streambanks, and forest edges. This species is considered an invasive plant in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It spreads primarily through seed dispersal by wind, water, and human activity. Due to its aggressive nature, it requires careful management to prevent further spread."
