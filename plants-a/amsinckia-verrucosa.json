    "intro": "Amsinckia verrucosa, commonly known as the sticky nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid and semi-arid regions. Amsinckia verrucosa is also known for its strong, sometimes unpleasant odor, which can deter herbivores."
