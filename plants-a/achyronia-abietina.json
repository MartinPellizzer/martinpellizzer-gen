    "intro": "Achyronia abietina, commonly known as the pine velvet leaf, is a rare and specialized plant found in specific alpine environments. It is characterized by its unique, velvety leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and it exhibits a distinct morphology adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically arranged in umbels, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, Achyronia abietina is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",
