    "intro": "Athyrium \u00d7 multifidum, commonly known as the Japanese painted fern, is a hybrid fern species that combines traits from its parent species, Athyrium nipponicum and Athyrium filix-femina. It is characterized by its elegant, finely divided, lacy fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery-blue hue on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps over time. The fronds are typically biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year and producing spores in the third."
