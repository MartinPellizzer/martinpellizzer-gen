    "intro": "Arabis murrayi, commonly known as the Murray's rockcress, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in coastal and inland regions. The plant features basal rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in spring. It is well adapted to arid conditions and has a compact growth habit that helps it conserve water. Arabis murrayi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
