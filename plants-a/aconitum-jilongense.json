    "intro": "Aconitum jilongense, commonly known as the Jilong monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features large, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in areas where children or pets are present.",
