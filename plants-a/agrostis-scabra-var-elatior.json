    "intro": "Agrostis scabra var. elatior, commonly known as the tall bentsgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage crop."
