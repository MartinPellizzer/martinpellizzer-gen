    "intro": "Acer microcarpon, commonly known as the dwarf maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its small, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.",
