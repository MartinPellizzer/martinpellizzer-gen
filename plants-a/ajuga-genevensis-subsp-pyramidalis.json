    "intro": "Ajuga genevensis subsp. pyramidalis, commonly known as the Pyramidal bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, ovate leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for ground cover in gardens."
