    "intro": "Arethusa catenata, commonly known as the swamp pink, is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in marshy areas and has long, narrow leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Its roots are adapted to tolerate waterlogged soil, and it plays an important role in wetland ecosystems. Arethusa catenata is also considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
