    "intro": "Aconitum franchetii var. subnaviculare, commonly known as the narrow-boatleaf monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple, spurred flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features palmately compound leaves with a distinctive, boat-shaped base, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
