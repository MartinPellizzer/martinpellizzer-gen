    "intro": "Acystopteris, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of small, terrestrial ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, often heart-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Acystopteris species are usually found growing on rocky substrates or in shaded, moist environments. They have a unique reproductive structure called a sorus, which contains the spore-producing organs. The genus includes several species, many of which are prized for their ornamental value in horticulture."
