    "intro": "Acrostichum reticulatum, commonly known as the lace fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in a fine, reticulate pattern, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it plays a role in maintaining soil stability in its habitat. The lace fern is an important component of the understory vegetation in tropical ecosystems.",
