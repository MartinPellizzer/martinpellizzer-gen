    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia filicifolia is primarily native to New South Wales and Queensland in Australia. This species thrives in the tropical and subtropical regions of these states. It is commonly found in open woodlands, heathlands, and along coastal areas. The plant is well adapted to the local climate and soil conditions of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia filicifolia was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and along roadsides, particularly in the Western and Eastern Cape provinces. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in sandy soils and withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in local ecosystems. Despite its ornamental value, it requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption."
