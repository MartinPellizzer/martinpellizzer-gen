    "intro": "Aphanes triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed sandweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered stems and tiny, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Aphanes triloba is adapted to sandy and gravelly soils, often found in desert environments where it thrives with minimal water. Its botanical features make it well-suited for survival in harsh, dry climates."
