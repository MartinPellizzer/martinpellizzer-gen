    "intro": "Agalmyla hilliardiae, commonly known as the Hilliard's agalmyla, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically large, heart-shaped, and covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
