    "intro": "Aubrieta intermedia, commonly known as the rock cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding vibrant color to rocky or gravelly soils. The plant has a compact growth habit with fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to thrive in well-drained, sunny conditions. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Aubrieta intermedia is drought-tolerant and prefers alkaline soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping."
