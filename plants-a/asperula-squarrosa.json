    "intro": "Asperula squarrosa, commonly known as the squarrose asperula, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a soft, woolly coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. Asperula squarrosa thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
