It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to deep red. The plant produces showy, velvety bracts that often resemble petals, enhancing its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aeschynanthus sojolianus is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
