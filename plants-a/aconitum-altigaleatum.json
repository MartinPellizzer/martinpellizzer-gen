    "intro": "Aconitum altigaleatum, commonly known as the highland aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in a spire-like inflorescence. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. Aconitum altigaleatum is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils.",
