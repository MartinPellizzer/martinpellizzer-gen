    "intro": "Aloe rugosquamosa, commonly known as the rough-squamose aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a layer of white, powdery wax. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellow-orange flowers. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their soothing properties. Aloe rugosquamosa is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves to survive dry conditions."
