    "intro": "Antennaria dimorpha var. integra, commonly known as the hooked sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy, greenish-gray leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of white to pinkish flowers with slender, hooked sepals, which give it its common name. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical structure reflects its ecological niche, making it a characteristic species of open, disturbed habitats."
