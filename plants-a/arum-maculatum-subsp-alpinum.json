    "intro": "Arum maculatum subsp. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine celandine, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features a rhizomatous root system and produces striking, arrow-shaped leaves with a waxy texture. The plant's most notable characteristic is its large, spatulate, greenish-yellow spathe that encloses a spadix, which bears numerous small, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
