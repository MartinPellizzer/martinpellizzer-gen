    "intro": "Anagallis ulugurensis, commonly known as the Uluguru catchfly, is a flowering plant native to the Uluguru Mountains in Tanzania. It is a small herbaceous species with slender, hairy stems and opposite leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to red flowers that bloom from late winter to early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats and is often found in forest understories. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
