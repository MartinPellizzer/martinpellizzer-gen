    "intro": "Aster frutescens, commonly known as the woodland aster, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist woodland habitats and features showy purple or blue flower heads that bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is characterized by its erect, branching stem and is often found in shaded, rich soil environments. Aster frutescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
