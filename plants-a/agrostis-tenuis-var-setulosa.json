It is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. The plant has a compact, tufted appearance with slender culms and small, spike-like inflorescences. It is well-adapted to moist soils and can thrive in partial shade, making it a common component of natural and managed grasslands. Its botanical features make it valuable for ecological studies and as a forage plant."
