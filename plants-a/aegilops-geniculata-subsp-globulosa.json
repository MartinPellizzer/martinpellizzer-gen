    "intro": "Aegilops geniculata subsp. globulosa, commonly known as the globular wild oat, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, globular inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces small, spikelet-based flowers. This species is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for genetic contribution to cultivated wheat."
