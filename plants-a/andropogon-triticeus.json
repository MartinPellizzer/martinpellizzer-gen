    "intro": "Andropogon triticeus, commonly known as switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. This plant is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy species. Switchgrass is often found in prairies, roadsides, and other disturbed areas. It is also valued for its potential as a bioenergy crop due to its high biomass yield and low input requirements."
