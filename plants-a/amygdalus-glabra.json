    "intro": "Amygdalus glabra, commonly known as the sweet almond tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Middle East and South Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, and its fragrant white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, oval fruits called drupes, which contain a single seed surrounded by a hard shell. The seeds, or almonds, are widely used in food, cosmetics, and medicine due to their high nutritional value. This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional horticulture."
