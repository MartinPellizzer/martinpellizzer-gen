    "intro": "Aster densifolius, commonly known as the dense-leaved aster, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of tiny florets. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its dense, dark green foliage provides a striking contrast to its showy purple or blue flower heads. Aster densifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
