It features dense clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The foliage is typically dark green and slightly hairy, adapting well to partial to full shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal in garden landscapes and its ability to thrive in less sunny conditions. It prefers well-drained soil and moderate moisture levels for optimal growth."
