It typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils in open woodlands and heathlands. The plant features wiry stems and small, clustered blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are linear, hairy, and often arranged in dense, compact clusters. This variety is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology and ecological adaptation to nutrient-poor environments."
