    "intro": "Atriplex littoralis var. stepposa, commonly known as coastal saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and arid regions with high salinity. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss and salt accumulation. It produces greenish-yellow flowers in compact clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. This species plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in harsh, saline habitats."
