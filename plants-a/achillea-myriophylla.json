    "intro": "Achillea myriophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It produces numerous tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across open landscapes. Achillea myriophylla is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.",
