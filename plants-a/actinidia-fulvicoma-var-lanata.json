    "intro": "Actinidia fulvicoma var. lanata, commonly known as the fuzzy actinidia, is a deciduous climbing vine native to China. It is characterized by its hairy, or lanate, leaves that give it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by edible, sweet berries in the fall. These berries are often used in traditional Chinese medicine and as a food source for wildlife. Its vigorous growth habit makes it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping.",
