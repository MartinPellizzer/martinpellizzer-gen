    "intro": "Asparagus mollis, commonly known as soft asparagus, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South Africa. It features slender, fern-like leaves that are soft to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by edible, needle-like stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Asparagus mollis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural displays."
