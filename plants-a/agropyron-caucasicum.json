    "intro": "Agropyron caucasicum, commonly known as the Caucasian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Agropyron caucasicum is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
