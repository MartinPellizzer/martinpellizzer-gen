    "intro": "Astragalus terrestris, commonly known as the common milkvetch, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features compound leaves with numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow to reddish-pink flowers in early summer. The plant is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. Astragalus terrestris is also known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
