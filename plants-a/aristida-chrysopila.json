It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and delicate, spike-like inflorescences that produce small, golden-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Aristida chrysopila is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
