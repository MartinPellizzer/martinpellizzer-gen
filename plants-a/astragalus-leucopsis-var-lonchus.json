    "intro": "Astragalus leucopsis var. lonchus, commonly known as the long-beaked milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of central Asia. It features slender, branched stems that grow from a fibrous root system, often reaching heights of up to 30 cm. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale yellow to white in color, arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that are covered in fine hairs. This species is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments."
