    "intro": "Armeria maritima var. sardoa, commonly known as the Sardinian thrift, is a coastal plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sardinia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid, salty environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or rocky coastal areas. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for coastal gardens and erosion control."
