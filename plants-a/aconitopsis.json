    "intro": "Aconitopsis, commonly known as the \"buttercup of the desert,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Ranunculaceae. It is characterized by its showy, often yellow or greenish-yellow flowers that resemble those of true buttercups. The plants typically have basal leaves with lobed or divided foliage, and they are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Aconitopsis species are often found in rocky soils and can thrive in regions with limited water availability. These plants are not only ornamental but also play a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
