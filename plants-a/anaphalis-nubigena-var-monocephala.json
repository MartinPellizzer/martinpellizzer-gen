    "intro": "Anaphalis nubigena var. monocephala, commonly known as the cloud alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and a single, elongated flower head that resembles a bell. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical structure is adapted to withstand harsh mountain climates, with thick, hairy leaves that reduce water loss."
