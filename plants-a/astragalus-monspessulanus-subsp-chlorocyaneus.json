    "intro": "Astragalus monspessulanus subsp. chlorocyaneus, commonly known as the greenleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and trifoliate leaves. The flowers are typically pale yellow to greenish-yellow, with a distinctive spurred structure at the base of the petals. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and dry habitats, often found in Mediterranean regions. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a food source for various pollinators and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
