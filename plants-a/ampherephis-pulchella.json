    "intro": "Ampherephis pulchella, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by oblong, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid lowland areas. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become an invasive species in certain regions."
