    "intro": "Avenula crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved sedge, is a perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow, linear leaves that are broad at the base. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown, emerging from leaf-like bracts. Avenula crassifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in association with other aquatic or semi-aquatic vegetation. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
