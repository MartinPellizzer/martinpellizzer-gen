    "intro": "Acer pubinerve var. apiferum, commonly known as the hairy-veined maple, is a variant of the pubinerve maple characterized by its distinctive pubescent (hairy) veins on the leaves. The leaves are typically palmately lobed with a serrated margin and a pale green underside. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, where it grows in temperate forests. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its ornamental value is appreciated in horticulture due to its unique foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions.",
