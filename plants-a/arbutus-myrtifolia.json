    "intro": "Arbutus myrtifolia, commonly known as the California madrone, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces bright red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, oval, and have a leathery texture with a distinctive waxy coating. Arbutus myrtifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
