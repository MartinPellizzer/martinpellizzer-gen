It is characterized by its rosette of grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant's most notable feature is its vibrant, showy inflorescence, which displays a mix of pink, red, and white hues. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. The variety discolor is distinguished by its unique coloration compared to the typical green foliage of the species."
