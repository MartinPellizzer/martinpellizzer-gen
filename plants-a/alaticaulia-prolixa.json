    "intro": "Alaticaulia prolixa, commonly known as the slender-stemmed alaticaulia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. The plant produces delicate, tubular flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense undergrowth of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
