    "intro": "Asplenium tenuicaule var. subvarians, commonly known as the slender fern, is a small evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or moist forest floors. Botanically, it is characterized by its reduced, sub-terete (narrow and slightly flattened) stipes and small, closely spaced pinnae."
