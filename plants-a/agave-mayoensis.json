    "intro": "Agave mayoensis, commonly known as the Mexican fire plant, is a succulent perennial native to the mountainous regions of Oaxaca, Mexico. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine and for making fibers, while the plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal. Agave mayoensis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
