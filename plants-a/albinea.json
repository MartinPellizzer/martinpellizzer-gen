    "intro": "Albinea, commonly known as the white-flowered orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Albinea has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to absorb nutrients efficiently from its habitat."
