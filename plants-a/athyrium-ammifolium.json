    "intro": "Athyrium ammifolium, commonly known as the sand-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that often have a pale or sandy-colored underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing leaves. Athyrium ammifolium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
