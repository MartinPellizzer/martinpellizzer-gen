    "intro": "Agapetes subansirica, commonly known as the Andean silverleaf, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a silvery-white pubescence, giving it its common name. It produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Agapetes subansirica is well adapted to cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests and alpine meadows."
