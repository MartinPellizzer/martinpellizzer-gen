    "intro": "Angophora euryphylla, commonly known as the broad-leaf angophora, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia and is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by woody, urn-shaped fruits. It is often found in coastal and riparian habitats, growing as a small tree or shrub. Angophora euryphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in native ecosystems."
