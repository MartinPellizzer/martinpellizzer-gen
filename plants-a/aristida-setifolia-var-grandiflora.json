It is a perennial grass that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its botanical characteristics include a fibrous root system and a clump-forming growth habit. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and its ecological value to native wildlife."
