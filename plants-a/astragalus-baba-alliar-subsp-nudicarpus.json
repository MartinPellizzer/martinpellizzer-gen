    "intro": "Astragalus baba-alliar subsp. nudicarpus, commonly known as the narrowpod milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions."
