It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and a tall, unbranched stem that bears a single flower head. The flower consists of ray florets that resemble dandelion petals, surrounded by a dense cluster of disk florets. It produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds, typical of the Asteraceae family. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats."
