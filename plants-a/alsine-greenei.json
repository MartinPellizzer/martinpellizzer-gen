    "intro": "Alsine greenei, commonly known as the Greene's sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Alsine greenei is adapted to sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it a common sight in desert ecosystems."
