    "intro": "Aristolochia indica var. magna, commonly known as the giant birthwort, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and unique, intricate, pipe-shaped flowers that are often greenish-yellow in color. The plant produces small, dark berries that contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal uses, it is cultivated in some regions despite its toxicity."
