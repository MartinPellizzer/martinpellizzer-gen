    "intro": "Aloe haworthioides, commonly known as the Haworth's aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves with white markings, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers on a tall stem during the growing season. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light. Its compact size and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation."
