    "intro": "Arachniodes reducta, commonly known as the spider fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble the intricate patterns of a spider's web. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and colonize shaded areas. Its leaves are bi-lobed and can grow up to 1 meter in length, making it a striking addition to shaded gardens. Arachniodes reducta prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it an ideal choice for woodland or bog gardens."
