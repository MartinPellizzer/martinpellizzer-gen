It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This plant thrives in humid, warm climates with high rainfall. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found near rivers and along forest edges. Due to its specific ecological requirements, its distribution is relatively limited to these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abolboda aubletii was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in warm, humid environments. It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soil and ample sunlight. This plant has been introduced to various parts of Southeast Asia, including the Philippines and Indonesia. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its potential invasiveness. However, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities and medicinal properties."
