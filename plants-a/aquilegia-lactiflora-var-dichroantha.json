    "intro": "Aquilegia lactiflora var. dichroantha, commonly known as the two-colored columbine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, spurred flowers that are typically blue or purple with yellow or orange markings. The plant features compound, pinnate leaves that are finely divided and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, loamy soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its showy blooms that appear in early to mid-summer."
