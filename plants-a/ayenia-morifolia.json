    "intro": "Ayenia morifolia, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to deep pink, typically blooming in the spring and summer months. Ayenia morifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its foliage and flowers are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its ornamental value is also appreciated in gardens."
