    "intro": "Aristopsis, commonly known as the silver fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-green foliage, which is often covered in a fine layer of trichomes. The plants are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments. Aristopsis species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to form dense, attractive ground cover. They play a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in their native habitats."
