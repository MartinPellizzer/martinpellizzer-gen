    "intro": "Arenaria fasciculata subsp. funkii, commonly known as the sandsteppe mouse-eared cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, and it has finely divided, grass-like leaves. It is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dunes. Its botanical features make it well-suited for survival in nutrient-poor, dry habitats."
