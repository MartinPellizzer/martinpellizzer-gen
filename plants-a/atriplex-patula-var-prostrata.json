    "intro": "Atriplex patula var. prostrata, commonly known as creeping saltbush, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are often concealed by its foliage. It is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a hardy species for harsh conditions. Its prostrate growth habit allows it to spread across the ground, stabilizing soil and preventing erosion."
