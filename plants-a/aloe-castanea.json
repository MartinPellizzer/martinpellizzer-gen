    "intro": "Aloe castanea, commonly known as the orange aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically orange-red in color, which help it store water and withstand arid conditions. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that has been used for its soothing properties in traditional medicine. Aloe castanea is well-suited for xeriscaping and thrives in full sun with minimal water."
