    "intro": "Aconitum napellus var. rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaved monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple spurred flowers, which are arranged in dense, terminal racemes. The leaves are palmately compound, with rounded lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This variant is closely related to other Aconitum species and contains potent toxins, making it both a valuable ornamental plant and a potentially dangerous one.",
