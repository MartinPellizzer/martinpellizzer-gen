    "intro": "Alloplectus bracteatus, commonly known as the bracted alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cold, dry conditions. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Alloplectus bracteatus is a perennial species that produces seed capsules containing numerous tiny seeds, aiding in its propagation in harsh mountainous regions."
