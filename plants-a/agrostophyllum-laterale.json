    "intro": "Agrostophyllum laterale, commonly known as the lateral grass-leaf plant, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that grow in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments in its natural habitat. Agrostophyllum laterale is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
