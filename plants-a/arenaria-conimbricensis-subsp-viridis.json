    "intro": "Arenaria conimbricensis subsp. viridis, commonly known as the green sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal or inland dunes. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. This subspecies is adapted to harsh, dry environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy habitats."
