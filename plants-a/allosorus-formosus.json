    "intro": "Allosorus formosus, commonly known as the Formosan allosorus, is a species of fern native to Taiwan. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense network of roots, which helps it anchor to substrates. Allosorus formosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
