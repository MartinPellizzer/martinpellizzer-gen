It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny seeds. This plant is highly adaptable, thriving in a variety of soil types and environmental conditions, including disturbed areas and sandy soils. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is often used in erosion control and forage production. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological and agricultural contexts."
