It is characterized by its basal rosette of shield-shaped, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, rounded clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountain slopes. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
