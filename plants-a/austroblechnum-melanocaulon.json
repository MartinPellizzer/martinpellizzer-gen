    "intro": "Austroblechnum melanocaulon, commonly known as the black-stemmed water fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in streamside habitats. Its rhizomes are covered in a dark, almost black, velvety coating, which gives it its common name. Austroblechnum melanocaulon plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its native ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates."
