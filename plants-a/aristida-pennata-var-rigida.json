    "intro": "Aristida pennata var. rigida, commonly known as rigid hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that are typically green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and grasslands. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes used in native plant gardens and restoration projects."
