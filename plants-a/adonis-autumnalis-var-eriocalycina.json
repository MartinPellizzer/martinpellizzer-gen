    "intro": "Adonis autumnalis var. eriocalycina, commonly known as the autumn adonis, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early blooming habit, which adds color to the garden during the transition from summer to fall.",
