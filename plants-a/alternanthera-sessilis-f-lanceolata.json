It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright red or pink, though they can vary in color depending on light conditions. The plant thrives in warm, tropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in water gardens and aquariums. It prefers shallow water and can grow in both submerged and floating forms. Its compact growth habit makes it an excellent choice for foreground planting in planted tanks."
