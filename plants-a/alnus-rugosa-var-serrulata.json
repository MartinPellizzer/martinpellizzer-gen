    "intro": "Alnus rugosa var. serrulata, commonly known as the serrated alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely serrated leaves, which are alternate and ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and in wetlands. This species is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a food source for various wildlife."
