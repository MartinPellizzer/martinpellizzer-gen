    "intro": "Astragalus zachlensis var. longifoliolatus, commonly known as the long-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves with elongated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow to pale brown flowers arranged in racemes, typical of the genus Astragalus. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
