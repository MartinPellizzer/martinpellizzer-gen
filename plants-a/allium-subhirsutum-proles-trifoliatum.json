    "intro": "Allium subhirsutum proles trifoliatum, commonly known as the three-leaf garlic chive, is a botanical variant of the garlic chive species. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, slightly hairy leaves that are often trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets. The plant produces small, bulbous clusters that resemble garlic cloves, which are edible and have a mild garlic flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its culinary uses. This variant is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is closely related to other Allium species such as garlic and leeks."
