    "intro": "Amaryllis \u00d7 variegata, commonly known as the variegated amaryllis, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Amaryllis belladonna and Amaryllis paradisicola. It is characterized by its striking variegated foliage, featuring a mix of green and white or yellow patterns on the leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, or white, often blooming in late winter or early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to be forced into bloom during the holiday season."
