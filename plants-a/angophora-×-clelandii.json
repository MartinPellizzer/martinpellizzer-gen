    "intro": "Angophora \u00d7 clelandii, commonly known as the Sydney red gum, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Angophora costata and Angophora robusta. It is a medium to tall tree characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels in strips, often revealing a reddish hue. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by woody, spherical capsules containing seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is commonly found in coastal and riverine habitats across eastern Australia. Angophora \u00d7 clelandii is valued for its ecological role and is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental bark and adaptability."
