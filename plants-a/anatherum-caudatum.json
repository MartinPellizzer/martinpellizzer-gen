    "intro": "Anatherum caudatum, commonly known as the tufted grass or cat-tail grass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often adorned with silky, feathery bristles. Anatherum caudatum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
