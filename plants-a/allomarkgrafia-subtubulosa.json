    "intro": "Allomarkgrafia subtubulosa, commonly known as the subtubular allomark, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, tubular-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to white. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a smooth texture and emits a faint, sweet fragrance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing near the forest floor. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
