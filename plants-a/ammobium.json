    "intro": "Ammobium, commonly known as the sandverbena, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their small, clustered flowers and often hairy leaves. They are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, South America, and Australia. Ammobium species are adapted to harsh environments, often thriving in sandy or rocky soils. Their ability to survive in extreme conditions makes them important components of their native ecosystems."
