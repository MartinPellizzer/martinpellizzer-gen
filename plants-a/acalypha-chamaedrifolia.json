    "intro": "Acalypha chamaedrifolia, commonly known as the creeping false nettle, is a low-growing shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that are typically borne in dense inflorescences. Its botanical characteristics include opposite leaf arrangement and a fibrous root system. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices.",

This species is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas across these regions. It thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with maritime environments. The plant is well adapted to the tropical and subtropical climates of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha chamaedrifolia was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its decorative value. The plant has been reported in several countries, including parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and the Caribbean. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Proper management is recommended to prevent its spread in non-native environments."
