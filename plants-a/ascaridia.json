    "intro": "Ascaridia, commonly known as the gastric roundworm, is a genus of parasitic nematodes that primarily infects the stomach of various birds. These worms are typically small, measuring between 1 to 5 centimeters in length, and have a simple, cylindrical body structure. The life cycle of Ascaridia involves the ingestion of infective eggs, which then develop into larvae within the host's gastrointestinal tract. The adult worms attach to the gastric lining using a muscular pharynx and feed on partially digested food. Botanically, Ascaridia is not a plant but a parasitic organism, so it does not have the typical botanical characteristics of plants."
