    "intro": "Andropogon nutans var. incompletus, commonly known as the partial nodding grass, is a variant of the nodding grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial grass characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The inflorescence consists of a single, drooping spikelet at the tip of each stem, which gives it its common name. This plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat for various wildlife species."
