    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthopanax chiisanensis is primarily native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan. It thrives in temperate to subtropical climates, often found in dense forests and rocky terrains. This plant is commonly associated with the Korean Peninsula and the southern parts of the Korean Mountains. It prefers well-drained soil and is often found at elevations ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species in certain regions of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopanax chiisanensis was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates, particularly in East Asia. It thrives in forested areas with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. This plant is often found in mountainous regions of China, Korea, and Japan. Its introduction has been primarily for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native environments."
