It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, often glabrous bark and elliptical, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, egg-shaped capsules that contain numerous seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction, and for its ornamental appeal in horticulture.
