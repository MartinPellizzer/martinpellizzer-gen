    "intro": "Aconitum duclouxii var. ecalcaratum, commonly known as the Himalayan monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Himalayas. It features striking blue-violet flowers arranged in a raceme, with prominent, helmet-like petals that are characteristic of the Aconitum genus. The plant has dark green, heart-shaped leaves with a waxy texture and a distinctive, spurred petal at the base of each flower. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, often growing in mountainous regions. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.",
