It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are often bright green and have a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its pod fruits are elongated and contain several seeds, typical of the legume family. Albizia conjugatopinnata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
