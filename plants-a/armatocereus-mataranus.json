It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that are often covered in spines and are capable of storing water. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming at night. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its striking appearance and unique adaptations, it is a popular choice for collectors and desert gardeners."
