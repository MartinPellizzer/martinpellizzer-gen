The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves that emerge from the base and contribute to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and containers. Amaryllis spiralis is known for its long blooming period, often lasting several weeks during the spring and summer months."
