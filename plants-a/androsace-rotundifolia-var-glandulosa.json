    "intro": "Androsace rotundifolia var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular cushion plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial herb native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It features dense, rosette-like clusters of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is often found in mountain meadows and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
