    "intro": "Antennaria oxyphylla, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is characterized by its small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with hairy stems and leaves that are often glandular and covered in fine, white hairs. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Antennaria oxyphylla plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
