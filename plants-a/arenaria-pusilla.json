    "intro": "Arenaria pusilla, commonly known as sand pink, is a small, flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in harsh environments, including rocky soils and sandy plains, where it forms dense mats. The plant produces delicate pink or white flowers in early summer, typically blooming from June to July. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs to reduce water loss. Arenaria pusilla plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its extreme habitat and is a symbol of resilience in cold climates."
