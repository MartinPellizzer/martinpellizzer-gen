It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are often harvested for their medicinal properties, containing compounds with potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects. Asarca speciosa thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
