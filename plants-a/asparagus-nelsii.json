    "intro": "Asparagus nelsii, commonly known as the silver feather asparagus, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white\u7ed2\u6bdb, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers in late spring, followed by red berries that attract birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or container planting. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid climates."
