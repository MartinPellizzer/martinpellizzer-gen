    "intro": "Atriplex muralis, commonly known as the rock saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to saline soils and can thrive in rocky or sandy habitats. Atriplex muralis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
