    "intro": "Acalypha flagellata, commonly known as the whipsaw plant, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, whip-like stems that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, triangular-shaped bracts. Its leaves are typically ovate with a slightly serrated edge, and they often have a velvety texture. Acalypha flagellata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some cultures.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha flagellata is primarily native to Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico Southeast, and Mexico Southwest. This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Acalypha flagellata is often part of the understory vegetation in these ecosystems. Its distribution is closely associated with humid climates and rich soil conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha flagellata was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since spread beyond cultivated areas into natural ecosystems. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is particularly common in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest margins. Its rapid growth and ability to reproduce both vegetatively and through seeds have contributed to its establishment in the wild. However, it is not currently considered a major invasive species in New Zealand."
