It is a climbing vine characterized by its heart-shaped, aromatic leaves and distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, musky odor. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are edible but contain toxic compounds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in humid, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal uses, it is cultivated in some regions for both horticultural and traditional purposes."
