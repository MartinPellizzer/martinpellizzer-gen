    "intro": "Abies cilicica subsp. borisii-regis, commonly known as the Bosnian fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the Dinaric Alps. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The cones are typically small and globose, maturing to a reddish-brown hue. This subspecies is adapted to cold, humid climates and thrives in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.",

This subspecies is commonly found in mountainous areas with a humid climate. It thrives in elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level. The plant is often found in mixed forests alongside other coniferous species. Its natural habitat includes limestone and schist soils, where it forms dense stands in the higher elevations of its range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies cilicica subsp. borisii-regis was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, particularly in mountainous regions. It thrives in areas with moderate rainfall and cool summers. This subspecies is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to form dense forests. It has been introduced to several European countries, including France and Italy. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems."
