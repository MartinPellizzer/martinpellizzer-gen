    "intro": "Asplenium balense, commonly known as the Balent's spleenwort, is a member of the Aspleniaceae family and is a small, epiphytic fern. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spores in clusters on the underside of its leaves, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Asplenium balense is native to Southeast Asia and is valued for its ornamental appeal in botanical gardens."
