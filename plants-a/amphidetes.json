These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to saline and sandy environments. They have distinctive, often blue or purple, bracts that surround their small flowers. The leaves are usually narrow and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Amphidetes species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils."
