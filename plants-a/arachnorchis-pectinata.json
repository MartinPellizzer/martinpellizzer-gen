    "intro": "Arachnorchis pectinata, commonly known as the peacock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Australia. It features a distinctive inflorescence with showy, violet to purple flowers that resemble peacock feathers, hence its common name. The plant has a slender, leafless stem that supports the floral display, and its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the soil. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and undergrowth. The orchid's flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly bees, and it is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae."
