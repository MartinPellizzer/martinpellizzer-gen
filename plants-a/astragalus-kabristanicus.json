    "intro": "Astragalus kabristanicus, commonly known as the Kabristan milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant produces small, hard-coated seeds that are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and steppe environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
