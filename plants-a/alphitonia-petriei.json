It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its thick, fibrous bark and dark green, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits.

It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
