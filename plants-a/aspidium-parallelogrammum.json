    "intro": "Aspidium parallelogrammum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams, ponds, or in damp woodlands. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to substrates like soil or rocks. Aspidium parallelogrammum is widely distributed across temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere."
