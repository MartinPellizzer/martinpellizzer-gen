    "intro": "Aylostera eos, commonly known as the dawn orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the early morning hours, hence its common name. Aylostera eos thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
