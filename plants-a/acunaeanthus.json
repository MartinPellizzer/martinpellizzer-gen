    "intro": "Acunaeanthus, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down. Its ornamental value is due to its striking floral display and ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny conditions. Acunaeanthus is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
