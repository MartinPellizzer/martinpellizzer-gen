It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. Alchemilla tytthantha is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
