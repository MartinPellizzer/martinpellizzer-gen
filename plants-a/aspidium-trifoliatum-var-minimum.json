    "intro": "Aspidium trifoliatum var. minimum, commonly known as the small fan fern, is a small, compact fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread slowly across the forest floor. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a subtle, glossy appearance. This variety is well-suited for shaded environments and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its elegant foliage."
