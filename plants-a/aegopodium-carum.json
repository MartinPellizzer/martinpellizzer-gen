    "intro": "Aegopodium carum, commonly known as bishop's weed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a bushy growth habit with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots and leaves contain various bioactive compounds, making it useful in traditional medicine. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive nature."
