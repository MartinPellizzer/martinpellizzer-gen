    "intro": "Archigrammitis demissa, commonly known as the small fern, is a delicate, low-growing fern species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium."
