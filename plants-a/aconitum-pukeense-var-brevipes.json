    "intro": "Aconitum pukeense var. brevipes, commonly known as the Pukeko River aconite, is a perennial herb native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense, spikelike clusters. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply cut lobes that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. This variety is notable for its shorter, more compact growth compared to other aconite species.",
