    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria f. rubriflora, commonly known as the red-flowered bladderwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated pod-like fruits that resemble bladders, a feature that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, red or pink flowers that are clustered in dense, globular inflorescences. It is typically found in dry, calcareous soils across Europe and parts of Asia. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
