    "intro": "Anthogonium, commonly known as the \"water clover,\" is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It features small, floating leaves that are typically four-lobed, resembling a four-leaf clover. These plants are often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Anthogonium species are characterized by their ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters and their role in aquatic ecosystems. They are also used in phytoremediation due to their capacity to absorb heavy metals from the water."
