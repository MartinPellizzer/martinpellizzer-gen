    "intro": "Aeschynanthus superbus, commonly known as the flame flower or the red-veined orchid, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with contrasting veins. The plant produces small, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Aeschynanthus superbus is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
