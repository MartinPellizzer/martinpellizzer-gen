    "intro": "Aira capillaris var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of Asia. It features fine, tufted blades that are typically less than 10 centimeters in height, forming dense, mat-like growths. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its compact form and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and water features."
