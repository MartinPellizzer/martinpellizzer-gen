    "intro": "Azalea vittata-punctata, commonly known as the spotted azalea, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly China and Korea. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and often have a slightly serrated edge, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant floral display. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its seasonal blooms and hardy nature."
