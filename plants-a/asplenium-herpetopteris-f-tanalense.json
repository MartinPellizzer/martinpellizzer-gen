    "intro": "Asplenium herpetopteris f. tanalense, commonly known as the Tanalense shield fern, is a fern species characterized by its unique frond morphology. It features lanceolate, deeply lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit, typically forming dense clusters on rocky or shaded substrates. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that are clustered in sori, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. This fern is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
