    "intro": "Acer pseudoplatanus atropurpureum, commonly known as the purple maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its dark purple to reddish-brown bark and its palmate leaves that turn vibrant red or orange in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shady environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping and botanical gardens.",
