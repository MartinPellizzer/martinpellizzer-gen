    "intro": "Agave parviflora subsp. flexiflora, commonly known as the flexible agave, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color with a waxy coating. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It is well adapted to dry climates and requires minimal water once established. Its slow growth and striking appearance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
