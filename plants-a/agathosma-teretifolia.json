    "intro": "Agathosma teretifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf silver tree, is a shrub native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its aromatic leaves have been traditionally used in herbal medicine."
