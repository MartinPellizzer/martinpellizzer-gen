    "intro": "Astragalus angustifolius subsp. euangustifolius, commonly known as narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, compound leaves with narrow, linear lobes. The plant produces yellow to golden yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its potential use in traditional herbal medicine."
