    "intro": "Artemisia leontopodioides, commonly known as the silverleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Artemisia leontopodioides is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine for various ailments."
