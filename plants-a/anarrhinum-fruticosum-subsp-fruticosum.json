    "intro": "Anarrhinum fruticosum subsp. fruticosum, commonly known as the Mediterranean thornapple, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a shrub characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, green, fleshy fruits that turn red when mature, often containing seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland scrub habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
