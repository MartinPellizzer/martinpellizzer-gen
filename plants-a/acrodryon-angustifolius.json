    "intro": "Acrodryon angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved acrodryon, is a flowering plant species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.",
