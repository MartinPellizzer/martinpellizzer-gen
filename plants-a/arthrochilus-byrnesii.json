    "intro": "Arthrochilus byrnesii, commonly known as the Byrnes' rock orchid, is a small terrestrial orchid native to Western Australia. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive, narrow lip. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and specialized root system adapted to nutrient-poor environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
