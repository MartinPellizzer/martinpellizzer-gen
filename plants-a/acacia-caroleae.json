    "intro": "Acacia caroleae, commonly known as the Carolinian acacia, is a shrub native to the island of Carola in the South Pacific. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant features bipinnate leaves and produces yellow to golden flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often growing in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species.",

It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in open woodlands and shrublands. The plant is well adapted to the climate of these areas, with features that help it conserve water. Its distribution is closely linked to the specific ecological conditions of New South Wales and Queensland.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia caroleae was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber and fuelwood. Its introduction has been associated with both ecological benefits and potential invasiveness in certain environments. Due to its adaptability, it has been planted in various parts of the world where it can tolerate high temperatures and low rainfall."
