    "intro": "Alyssopsis mollis var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the soft hairless alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South Africa. It features small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to dense, fine hairs covering the leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
