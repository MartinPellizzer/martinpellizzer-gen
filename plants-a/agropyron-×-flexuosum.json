    "intro": "Agropyron \u00d7 flexuosum, commonly known as the creeping wheatgrass, is a hybrid perennial grass native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces dense, tufted clusters of spikelets. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves that are often rolled in the bud, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas. Agropyron \u00d7 flexuosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone environments."
