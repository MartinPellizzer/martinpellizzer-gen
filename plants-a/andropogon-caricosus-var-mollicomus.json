    "intro": "Andropogon caricosus var. mollicomus, commonly known as silky bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, blue-green blades with a soft, silky texture, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and prairies, preferring well-drained soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Silky bluestem is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant landscapes."
