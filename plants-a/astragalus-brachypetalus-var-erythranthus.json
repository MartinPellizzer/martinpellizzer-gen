    "intro": "Astragalus brachypetalus var. erythranthus, commonly known as the red-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces showy, pea-shaped flowers that are typically pink to red in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
