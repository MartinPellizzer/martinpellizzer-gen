    "intro": "Asclepias cucullata, commonly known as the hooded milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive hooded flowers that resemble a crown, typically ranging in color from white to pink. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which are used by monarch butterflies for defense. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a velvety texture. Asclepias cucullata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands."
