    "intro": "Aesculus hippocastanum var. albovariegatum, commonly known as the white-variegated horse chestnut, is a cultivar of the horse chestnut tree characterized by its distinctive white and green variegated leaves. This variety originates from natural mutations of the common horse chestnut, Aesculus hippocastanum, and is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and parks. The tree produces showy, umbellate clusters of white flowers in spring, followed by spiny, spherical fruits containing glossy, chestnut-like seeds. Its foliage provides seasonal color changes, with bright yellow leaves in autumn, enhancing its visual appeal throughout the year. The plant is relatively hardy and adapts well to a variety of soil types, making it a popular choice for urban and suburban landscapes."
