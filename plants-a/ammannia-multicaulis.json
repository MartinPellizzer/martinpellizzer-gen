    "intro": "Ammannia multicaulis, commonly known as redroot ammannia, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright, herbaceous stem that often turns reddish in color, especially under stress. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by red, fleshy berries. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Ammannia multicaulis thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds."
