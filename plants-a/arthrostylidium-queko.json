    "intro": "Arthrostylidium queko, commonly known as the New Zealand flat moss, is a small, mat-forming liverwort found in moist, shaded environments. It has a simple, leafy structure with small, overlapping leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its leaf-like structures. It thrives in cool, humid conditions and is often found in forest undergrowth or on rocky surfaces. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native habitat."
