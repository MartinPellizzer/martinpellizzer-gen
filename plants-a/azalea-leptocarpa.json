    "intro": "Azalea leptocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved azalea, is a species of flowering plant in the Rhododendron genus. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, where it thrives in humid, temperate climates. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It prefers acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Azalea leptocarpa is also valued for its ability to bloom in early spring, adding vibrant color to gardens during the transition from winter to summer."
