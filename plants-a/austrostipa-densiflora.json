    "intro": "Austrostipa densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, wiry stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Austrostipa densiflora plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native fauna."
