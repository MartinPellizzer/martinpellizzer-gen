    "intro": "Anacheilium cochleatum, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking spiral-shaped inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pink, often arranged in a helical pattern along the stem. Anacheilium cochleatum thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
