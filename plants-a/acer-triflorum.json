    "intro": "Acer triflorum, commonly known as the three-flowered maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Acer triflorum typically grows to a height of 10 to 25 meters and thrives in moist, well-drained soils.",
