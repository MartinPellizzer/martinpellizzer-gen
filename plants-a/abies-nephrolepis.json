    "intro": "Abies nephrolepis, commonly known as the Japanese fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, cylindrical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, releasing seeds in the fall. Its foliage provides dense shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. The Japanese fir is adapted to cool, moist climates and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies nephrolepis is primarily native to Amur, China North-Central, Khabarovsk, Korea, Manchuria, and Primorye. This species is found in the temperate to subarctic regions of East Asia. It thrives in mountainous areas with cool, moist climates. The plant is commonly found in forests at higher elevations. Its native range spans across several regions in Russia and northeastern China.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies nephrolepis was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States and parts of Canada. It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive pyramidal shape and evergreen foliage. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and cooler climates, making it suitable for specific garden and landscape settings. However, it has also been reported in other regions where it has established itself as an invasive species. Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems and biodiversity."
