    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum subsp. verticilliflorus, commonly known as the panic grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its clumping growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in hue. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in disturbed areas and along roadsides. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is often used in landscaping and erosion control."
