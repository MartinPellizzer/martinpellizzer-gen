    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia hispidissima is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe. It is commonly found in savanna and woodland habitats, particularly in areas with well-drained soils. This species thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing along riverbanks and in rocky outcrops. It is well adapted to the local climate, with its thorny structure providing protection against herbivores. Acacia hispidissima plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia hispidissima was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has been widely cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid conditions. It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides, particularly in the Western and Eastern Cape provinces. The plant is well adapted to dry climates and can tolerate poor soil conditions, making it a popular choice for landscaping. However, it has also been reported to naturalize in some areas, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds have led to its classification as an environmental weed in certain regions."
