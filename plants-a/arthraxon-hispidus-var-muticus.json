The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense spikes, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. Its ecological role includes providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to soil stabilization in wetland ecosystems."
