It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, green pods that mature into brown, woody fruits. It is well adapted to dry climates and has been cultivated for its oil-rich fruits for thousands of years. The plant plays an important role in both ecological and economic systems in its native habitat.",
