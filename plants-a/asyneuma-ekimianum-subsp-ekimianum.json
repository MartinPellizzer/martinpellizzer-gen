    "intro": "Asyneuma ekimianum subsp. ekimianum, commonly known as the Ekinian false dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in a single head, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. It has a fibrous root system and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
