    "intro": "Aster pilosus var. pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the United States, particularly found in the western regions. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is known for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in rocky soils. It has fine, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss, and its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
