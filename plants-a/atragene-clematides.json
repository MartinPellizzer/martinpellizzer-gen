    "intro": "Atragene clematides, commonly known as the bluebell vine, is a climbing plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, woody stems that twine around supports, and its leaves are heart-shaped with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue and purple, which bloom in spring. These flowers are followed by small, round berries that ripen to a dark blue color. Atragene clematides is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny conditions."
