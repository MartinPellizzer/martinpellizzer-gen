    "intro": "Aconitum umezawae, commonly known as Umezawa's aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Japan. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in racemes at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed segments, and its roots contain toxic alkaloids similar to other aconite species. Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is often cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling.",
