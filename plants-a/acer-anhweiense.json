It is commonly found in mountainous regions and along riverbanks in these areas. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with secondary growth forests. It is an important component of the local flora and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value. The plant is also found in parts of Korea and Japan, where it is considered a rare and relict species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer anhweiense was mainly introduced to the eastern and central regions of China, where it thrives in temperate climates. It is commonly found in forested areas and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained soil. This species is valued for its ornamental value due to its vibrant autumn foliage. It has also been introduced to parts of Southeast Asia for horticultural purposes. However, its natural range remains primarily within its native habitat in China."
