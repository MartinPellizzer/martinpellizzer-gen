    "intro": "Aletes lithophila, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a rare and unique plant native to the rocky habitats of southern Africa. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows on limestone or basalt substrates, often in crevices or on rock faces. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinct, intricate structure typical of orchids. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the rocky environment, and it often forms symbiotic relationships with specific fungi. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, Aletes lithophila is considered a rare and endangered species."
