    "intro": "Asplenium serratum var. caudatum, commonly known as the tailed spleenwort, is a fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves with serrated margins, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or forest floors. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
