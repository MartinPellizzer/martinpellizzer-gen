    "intro": "Ariocarpus retusus subsp. scapharostroides, commonly known as the \"Bull's Horn Cactus,\" is a small, spineless cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It features a short, thick, ribbed stem with a distinctive, bulbous shape that resembles a horn. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, which are borne on short pedicels near the apex. It is adapted to arid conditions, storing water in its fleshy stem and having a shallow root system. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a popular specimen among cactus enthusiasts and conservationists."
