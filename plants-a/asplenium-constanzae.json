    "intro": "Asplenium constanzae, commonly known as the Constantza's spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant is epiphytic or lithophytic, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it is found primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. Asplenium constanzae is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitats."
