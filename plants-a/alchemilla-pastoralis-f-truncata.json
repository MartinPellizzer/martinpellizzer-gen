    "intro": "Alchemilla pastoralis f. truncata, commonly known as the short-stemmed lady's mantle, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to Europe. It features upright, rounded rosettes of dark green, velvety foliage that is often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, golden-yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on slender, branching stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and delicate blooms, which contribute to its popularity among gardeners."
