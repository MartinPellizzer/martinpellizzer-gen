    "intro": "Astragalus aulacolobus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. It is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor environments."
