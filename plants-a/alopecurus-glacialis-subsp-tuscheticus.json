    "intro": "Alopecurus glacialis subsp. tuscheticus, commonly known as the alpine meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils of mountain meadows and alpine tundra. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is an important component of alpine ecosystems."
