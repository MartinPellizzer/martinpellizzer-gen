    "intro": "Axonopus digitatus, commonly known as the hairy sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Axonopus digitatus is a clump-forming plant that spreads through rhizomes, making it a common ornamental and ecological plant in wetland restoration projects. Its adaptability to wet conditions makes it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
