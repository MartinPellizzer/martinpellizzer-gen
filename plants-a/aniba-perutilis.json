    "intro": "Aniba perutilis, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a glossy green upper surface. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by dark, fleshy fruits. Due to overharvesting, it is now listed as a vulnerable species on the IUCN Red List."
