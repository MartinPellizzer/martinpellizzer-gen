    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acampe papillosa is primarily native to the southern United States, particularly Texas and New Mexico. It is commonly found in dry, rocky habitats such as limestone outcrops and sandy soils. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in open woodlands and grasslands. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions and high temperatures. Acampe papillosa is an important component of the local flora in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acampe papillosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can grow in both full sun and partial shade. Its rapid spread has led to increased management efforts to control its impact on local ecosystems."
