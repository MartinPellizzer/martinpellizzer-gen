    "intro": "Aechmea pulchra, commonly known as the velvet plant or the pink pineapple, is a striking bromeliad native to the rainforests of South America. It features a rosette of broad, dark green, velvety leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater. The plant produces striking red or pink bracts that enclose its small, white flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Aechmea pulchra is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
