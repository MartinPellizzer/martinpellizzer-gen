    "intro": "Aeschynomene roxburghii, commonly known as Indian needlegrass, is a herbaceous annual plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a common weed in agricultural fields. Aeschynomene roxburghii is also valued for its potential use in forage and soil stabilization due to its rapid growth and deep root system."
