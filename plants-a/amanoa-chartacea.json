    "intro": "Amanoa chartacea, commonly known as the paperleaf pohuehue, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped, chartaceous leaves that are often used in traditional Hawaiian crafts. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming during the summer months. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in coastal and lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Amanoa chartacea is considered a vulnerable species."
