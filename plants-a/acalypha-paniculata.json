    "intro": "Acalypha paniculata, commonly known as the flame bush, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters in height, characterized by its palmate leaves and showy, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in paniculate arrangements, giving it its scientific name. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine, and it is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. Acalypha paniculata thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.",

This species is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these countries. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including moist forests, grasslands, and disturbed areas. The plant is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its foliage. Its wide distribution suggests a high adaptability to different environmental conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha paniculata was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and showy inflorescences. It has been widely cultivated in gardens and landscapes across Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of the Americas. The plant is often used in hedges, borders, and as a ground cover because of its rapid growth and adaptability to various soil types. However, it has also become an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. Its introduction has led to increased management efforts to control its spread in non-native habitats."
