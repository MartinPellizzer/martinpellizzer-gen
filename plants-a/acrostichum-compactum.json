    "intro": "Acrostichum compactum, commonly known as the compact fern, is a species of fern native to the wet tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as swamps and forest floors. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are pinnate, with small, ovate leaflets that give it a lush, feathery appearance.",
