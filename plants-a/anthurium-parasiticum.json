    "intro": "Anthurium parasiticum, commonly known as the parasitic anthurium, is a rare and unique species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is a hemi-parasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from a host plant while also performing photosynthesis. Its striking, heart-shaped leaves are often adorned with vibrant red or orange spathes, which are modified leaves that enclose the true flowers. The plant typically grows on the branches of larger trees, forming a symbiotic relationship with its host. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species and is rarely found in cultivation."
