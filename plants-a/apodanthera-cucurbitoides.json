    "intro": "Apodanthera cucurbitoides, commonly known as the false cucumber, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, and its fruit is a fleshy, spiny capsule that resembles a cucumber. Apodanthera cucurbitoides is often found in moist, tropical environments and can grow along riverbanks or in disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
