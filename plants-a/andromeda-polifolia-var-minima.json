    "intro": "Andromeda polifolia var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale pink flowers in early spring. The plant is adapted to acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded, moist environments. It is valued for its aromatic leaves and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
