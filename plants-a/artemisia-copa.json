    "intro": "Artemisia copa, commonly known as southernwood, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, gray-green leaves that are finely divided and covered in a powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which appear in late spring to early summer. Its essential oils contain compounds like thujone and camphor, contributing to its strong, camphor-like scent. Artemisia copa is often used in traditional herbal medicine and as a decorative plant in gardens."
