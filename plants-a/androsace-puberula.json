It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its alpine environment. Its flowers are typically pink or white, with five petals and a distinctive central boss. Androsace puberula thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in high-altitude meadows."
