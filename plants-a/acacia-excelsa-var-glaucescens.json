    "intro": "Acacia excelsa var. glaucescens, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to southeastern Australia. It features slender, zigzagging branches and produces yellow globular flower heads that bloom in spring. The leaves are bipinnate, with small, linear leaflets that give the plant a feathery appearance. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia excelsa var. glaucescens is primarily native to northern Australia, including regions of Queensland and the Northern Territory. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils. This variant is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall, making it a common sight in tropical and subtropical regions. It is also found in parts of New Guinea and some islands in the Pacific. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia excelsa var. glaucescens was mainly introduced to urban and suburban landscapes in southern Africa for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in disturbed soils. It is commonly found in gardens, along roadsides, and in degraded areas where it forms dense thickets. The plant's rapid growth and adaptability have led to its spread beyond cultivated areas, sometimes becoming invasive in native ecosystems. Due to its hardiness, it is often used in reforestation and erosion control projects. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on local biodiversity and habitat competition."
