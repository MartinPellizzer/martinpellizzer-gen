    "intro": "Ajuga glabrata, commonly known as carpet bugle or broadleaf bugle, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue to purple flowers in early to mid-summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its dense foliage makes it an excellent ground cover plant."
