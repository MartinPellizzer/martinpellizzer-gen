    "intro": "Alnus sitchensis var. kamtschatica, commonly known as the Kamchatka alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of eastern Siberia and the Russian Far East. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small, aggregate fruits that disperse via wind. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal forests and wetlands. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen, enriching the soil for other plant species. Its adaptability to harsh climates makes it a resilient component of boreal and temperate ecosystems."
