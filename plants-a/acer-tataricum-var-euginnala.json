It is characterized by its striking, finely toothed leaves that turn bright yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its rapid growth and ornamental value, it is often planted in urban landscapes.",
