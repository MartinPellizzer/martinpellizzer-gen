    "intro": "Asplenium meniscioides, commonly known as the heart's sorrow fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rosette-like growth pattern, with the fronds curling inward to form a compact, rounded shape. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium meniscioides is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its elegant appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
