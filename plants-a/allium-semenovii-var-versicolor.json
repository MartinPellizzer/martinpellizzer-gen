    "intro": "Allium semenovii var. versicolor, commonly known as the colorful onion, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its bulbous roots and tall, slender stems. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that display a range of colors, from white to purple and pink, making it visually distinctive. Its foliage consists of long, strap-like leaves that are typically green with a slight bluish tint. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral characteristics, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
