    "intro": "Androsace pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its dense, rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
