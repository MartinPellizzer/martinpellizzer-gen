    "intro": "Astragalus pachyrrhizus, commonly known as the thick-root milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its robust, thickened roots that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with compound leaves and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat."
