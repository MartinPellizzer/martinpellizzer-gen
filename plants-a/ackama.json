    "intro": "Ackama, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a large aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant has showy, fragrant white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its roots anchor it in muddy substrates, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies. Ackama plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various water organisms."
