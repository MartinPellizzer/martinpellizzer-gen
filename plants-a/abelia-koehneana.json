    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelia koehneana is primarily native to China, specifically the provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan. It thrives in the mountainous regions of these areas, where the climate is temperate and humid. This plant is often found in forests and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade. It is a member of the honeysuckle family and is known for its fragrant, tubular flowers. Due to its unique characteristics, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens outside its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia koehneana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and streamside habitats. This plant is valued for its fragrant flowers and attractive foliage. It has been used in ornamental gardening due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in native ecosystems."
