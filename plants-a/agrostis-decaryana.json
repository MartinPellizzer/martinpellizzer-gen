    "intro": "Agrostis decaryana, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and tufted growth habit, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Agrostis decaryana is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
