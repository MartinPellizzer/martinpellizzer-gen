    "intro": "Anthurium pradoense, commonly known as the Pradoense flamingo flower, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix and a spathe. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its vibrant, colorful spathe is often used in ornamental horticulture, while its unique structure supports pollination by specific insect species. Anthurium pradoense thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil."
