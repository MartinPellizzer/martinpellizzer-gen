    "intro": "Asphodeliris, commonly known as the fairy lantern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asphodelaceae. It is native to southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce striking, tubular flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. Asphodeliris species are often used in rock gardens and dry landscapes due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value. They are also valued in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
