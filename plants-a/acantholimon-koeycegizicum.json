    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon koeycegizicum is primarily native to Turkey. It is found in specific regions within the country, particularly in the eastern and central areas. This plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is limited to certain ecological zones where it can thrive with minimal water availability. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique characteristics and restricted range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon koeycegizicum was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region, particularly in Turkey, as a ornamental plant due to its attractive silvery foliage and compact growth habit. It is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Despite its ornamental value, it has shown limited naturalization outside of cultivated areas. The plant is relatively drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid climates. However, its distribution remains primarily restricted to horticultural settings rather than wild populations."
