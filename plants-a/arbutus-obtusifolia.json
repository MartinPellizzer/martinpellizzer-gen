    "intro": "Arbutus obtusifolia, commonly known as the Pacific madrone, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by edible berries that ripen in the fall. Its leaves are broad, leathery, and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its coastal habitat. Arbutus obtusifolia is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas along the Pacific coast."
