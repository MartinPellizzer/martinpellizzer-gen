    "intro": "Acetosella regnellii, commonly known as the red sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Primulaceae family. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves that are often reddish in color, especially when grown in full sun. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Acetosella regnellii thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects.",
