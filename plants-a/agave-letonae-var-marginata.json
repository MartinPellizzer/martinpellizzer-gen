    "intro": "Agave letonae var. marginata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color with a narrow margin. The leaves are lined with sharp, spiny teeth and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellowish-green flowers. This variety is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
