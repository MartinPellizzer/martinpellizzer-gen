    "intro": "Amsonia tenuifolia, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, blue-gray flowers that appear in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are slightly hairy and turn a striking copper color in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for native gardens. Amsonia tenuifolia is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
