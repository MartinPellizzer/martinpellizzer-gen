    "intro": "Amygdalus tangutica, commonly known as the Tangut peach, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the high altitudes of Tibet and northern India. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, white to pink flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to peaches but have a distinct flavor. It is adapted to cold and arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. Amygdalus tangutica is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its potential for cultivation in temperate climates."
