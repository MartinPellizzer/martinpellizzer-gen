    "intro": "Aspidium aculeatum var. moritzianum, commonly known as the Moritz's water fern, is a variant of the common water fern native to Southeast Asia. It is a perennial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp forest undergrowth. The plant has dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant."
