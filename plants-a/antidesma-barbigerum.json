    "intro": "Antidesma barbigerum, commonly known as the feathered antidesma, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, fleshy fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
