    "intro": "Andropogon nervosus, commonly known as narrow-veined grass, is a tall perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as swamps and marshes, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, with narrow, linear leaves that have prominent parallel veins. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-bearing branches, typical of the grass family Poaceae. Andropogon nervosus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
