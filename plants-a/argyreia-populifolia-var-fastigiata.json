It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink to violet, which bloom in the early morning. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade.
