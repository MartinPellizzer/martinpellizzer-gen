    "intro": "Androcymbium henssenianum, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals and a unique, elongated floral structure that distinguishes it from other orchid species. The plant typically grows in tropical rainforests, thriving in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil. Its flowers bloom in spring, producing a strong, sweet fragrance that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
