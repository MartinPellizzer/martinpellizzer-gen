It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant contains irritant chemicals in its leaves, which can cause a stinging sensation upon contact with the skin. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.
