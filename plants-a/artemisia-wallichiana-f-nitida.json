    "intro": "Artemisia wallichiana f. nitida, commonly known as the silver artemisia, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the Himalayas. It features silvery-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine, soft hairs, which reflect light and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during the summer months. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Its aromatic leaves release a strong, camphor-like scent when crushed."
