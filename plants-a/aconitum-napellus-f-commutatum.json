    "intro": "Aconitum napellus f. commutatum, commonly known as the European garden aconite, is a hybrid form of the deadly nightshade family. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring large, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. Its root system is tuberous, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils in partial shade. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and toxicity, containing potent alkaloids that make it highly dangerous if ingested.",
