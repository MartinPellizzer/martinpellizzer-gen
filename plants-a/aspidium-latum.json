    "intro": "Aspidium latum, commonly known as the broad shield fern, is a species of fern native to Asia, Africa, and Australia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The fronds are bi-directionally arranged, with fertile and sterile fronds occurring on separate plants."
