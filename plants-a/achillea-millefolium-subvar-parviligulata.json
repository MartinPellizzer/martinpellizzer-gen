    "intro": "Achillea millefolium subvar. parviligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features finely divided, feather-like leaves that are typically narrower than those of the standard *A. millefolium*. The plant produces small, flat-topped clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This subspecies is noted for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.",
