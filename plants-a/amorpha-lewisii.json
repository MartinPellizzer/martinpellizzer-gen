    "intro": "Amorpha lewisii, commonly known as yellow strappy, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces elongated seed pods that turn brown as they mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairies, open woods, and along roadsides. Amorpha lewisii is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for ecological restoration projects."
