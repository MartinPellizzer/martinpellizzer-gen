    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acca sellowiana is primarily native to Brazil, specifically the southeastern and southern regions. It is commonly found in the states of S\u00e3o Paulo, Minas Gerais, and Rio de Janeiro. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and dry forests. It is also known as the Brazilian guava or erva-cidra. Its native distribution includes parts of Paraguay and Uruguay as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acca sellowiana was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates for its ornamental value and potential as a fruit-bearing plant. It has been cultivated in tropical and subtropical areas, including parts of South America, Africa, and Southeast Asia. The plant is often grown in gardens and landscapes due to its attractive foliage and fragrant flowers. However, it has also become an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns about ecological impacts in non-native habitats."
