    "intro": "Alchemilla palmata subsp. crinita, commonly known as the hairy lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to form dense, low-growing clumps."
