    "intro": "Acantholimon iskanderi, commonly known as the Iskander's thornweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its succulent, spiny stems and small, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are often fleshy and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Acantholimon iskanderi plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying xerophytic adaptations.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon iskanderi is primarily native to the high mountain regions of the Eastern Mediterranean, specifically in Syria and Lebanon. It is found in rocky and gravelly slopes at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 2,500 meters. This plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates with poor soil conditions. It is often found in areas with limited vegetation cover. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon iskanderi was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and rocky substrates, typically found in arid or semi-arid regions. It thrives in environments with low humidity and full sun exposure, making it suitable for xerophytic ecosystems. The plant is commonly found in mountainous regions, particularly in the Mediterranean and Middle Eastern climates. Its introduction has been documented in several countries, including Turkey, Syria, and parts of southern Europe. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping for drought-resistant garden designs."
