It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring large, pinnately compound leaves with a distinctive, aromatic scent. The plant produces tall, branched flowering stems that bear small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in complex umbels. Its roots are thick, fleshy, and often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits.
