    "intro": "Arctostaphylos glandulosa var. adamsii, commonly known as the Adams' manzanita, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with leathery, oval-shaped leaves that are often glandular-dotted. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white, typically in late winter to early spring. Its fruit is a capsule that releases sticky, winged seeds, aiding in seed dispersal. This species is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats."
