    "intro": "Arbutus menziesii, commonly known as the Pacific madrone, is a broadleaf evergreen shrub or small tree native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The plant produces white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by edible berries that are dark red to black in color. Its leaves are leathery, glossy, and turn vibrant orange or red in the fall. Arbutus menziesii thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal forests and chaparral habitats."
