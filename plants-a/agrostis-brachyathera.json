    "intro": "Agrostis brachyathera, commonly known as the shortawn bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in other damp habitats. Agrostis brachyathera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass mixes."
