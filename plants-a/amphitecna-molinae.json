    "intro": "Amphitecna molinae, commonly known as the Molina's shield fern, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its rhizome is short and thick, supporting the growth of its intricate foliage. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
