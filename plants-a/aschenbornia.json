    "intro": "Aschenbornia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pale green or white, leafless stems and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its stems for photosynthesis, making it a specialized epiphyte. Its botanical features make it highly susceptible to environmental changes, contributing to its endangered status. Aschenbornia is often found in moist, shaded areas of pine rocklands and hammocks."
