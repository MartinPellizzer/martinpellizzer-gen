It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, showy white or pale blue flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded woodland areas. Its unique coloration and structure make it a visually striking addition to gardens and natural habitats."
