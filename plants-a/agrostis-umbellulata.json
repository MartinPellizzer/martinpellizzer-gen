    "intro": "Agrostis umbellulata, commonly known as the woolly bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to yellowish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
