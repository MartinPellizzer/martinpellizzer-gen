    "intro": "Asplenium marinum var. bulbiferum, commonly known as the sea spleenwort, is a fern native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its fronds. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky substrates or in maritime climates. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are typically arranged in a single row along the fronds. This variety is notable for its ability to tolerate salt spray and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness."
