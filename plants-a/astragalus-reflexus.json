    "intro": "Astragalus reflexus, commonly known as the reflexed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its root system is deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Astragalus reflexus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
