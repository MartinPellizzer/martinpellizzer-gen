    "intro": "Abrus precatorius, commonly known as the Indian rue or bead tree, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, ornate, and often brightly colored seed pods that contain toxic, bead-like seeds. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has compound leaves with three to five leaflets. Its seeds contain abrin, a potent lectin toxin that can be lethal if ingested. Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care and avoid consumption of any part of it.",

It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in disturbed habitats and along roadsides. The plant is known for its distinctive red seed pods and is sometimes referred to as the \"rosy wolf\" or \"bead tree.\" It has been introduced to various regions outside its native range, where it can become invasive. Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrus precatorius was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions across the Pacific, Caribbean, and Atlantic, including the Bahamas, Fiji, Hawaii, and the Philippines. It has been widely distributed in Central and South America, such as Brazil, Colombia, and Peru, as well as in the Caribbean islands like Cuba and Jamaica. The plant is also present in the Indian Ocean, including areas like the Andaman Islands, Madagascar, and the Maldives. Its introduction is likely due to its ornamental value and traditional uses. It is now considered an invasive species in many of these regions."
