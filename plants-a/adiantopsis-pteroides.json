    "intro": "Adiantopsis pteroides, commonly known as the feather fern, is a delicate and elegant member of the Adiantaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a soft, lace-like appearance. Native to the tropical regions of South America, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which is a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant's botanical features make it a striking addition to both botanical gardens and private collections.",
