    "intro": "Aconitum campylorrhynchum var. campylorrhynchum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant features palmately divided leaves with a distinctive heart-shaped base, and its roots are tuberous, often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its toxic properties, it requires careful handling and is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes.",
