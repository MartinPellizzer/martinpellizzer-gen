It belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to alpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature. Armeria alpina is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand harsh climatic conditions."
