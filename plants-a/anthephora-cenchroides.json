    "intro": "Anthephora cenchroides, commonly known as the coastal lantana, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Anthephora cenchroides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens."
