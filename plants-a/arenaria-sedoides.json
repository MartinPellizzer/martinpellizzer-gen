    "intro": "Arenaria sedoides, commonly known as the sandstone pink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and sandy soils in arid regions. It features small, showy pink or purple flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to its harsh environment. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Arenaria sedoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
