    "intro": "Arctostaphylos sonomensis, commonly known as the Sonoma manzanita, is a shrub native to California, specifically found in the coastal regions of Sonoma County. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, urn-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
