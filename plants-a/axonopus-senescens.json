It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, preferring moist, well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale yellow to brown flowers. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in ecological studies and wetland management."
