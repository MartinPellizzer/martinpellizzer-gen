    "intro": "Aspidopterys roxburghiana, commonly known as the Himalayan snowbell, is a deciduous shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, round, green berries that turn dark blue when mature. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered with a fine pubescence. Aspidopterys roxburghiana is well adapted to cold, alpine environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats at elevations above 2,000 meters."
