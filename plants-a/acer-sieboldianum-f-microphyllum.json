It features small, ovate leaves that are typically bright green in summer and turn shades of red and orange in autumn. The plant has a slow growth rate, making it ideal for smaller garden spaces. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun exposure. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and compact, bushy form.",
