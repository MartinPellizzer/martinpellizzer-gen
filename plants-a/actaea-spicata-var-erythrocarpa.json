    "intro": "Actaea spicata var. erythrocarpa, commonly known as the red-fruited bugbane, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems that bear large, palmately compound leaves. The plant produces showy, white to pale pink flowers in late summer, which are clustered in spiky inflorescences. Its berries are distinctive for their bright red color and are typically toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.",
