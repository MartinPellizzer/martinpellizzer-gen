    "intro": "Agrostis ventosa, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f (clump-forming) growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis ventosa is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for grazing animals."
