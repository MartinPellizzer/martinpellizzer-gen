    "intro": "Aulacodiscus enneandrus, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, featuring thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family, and its latex is milky and toxic. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
