It typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters and has pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in spring, followed by edible, sweet-tasting drupes. The seeds, or almonds, are encased in a hard shell and are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. It is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas."
