    "intro": "Acaena ischnostemon, commonly known as the small-stemmed wood rose, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its prickly, thorn-like stems and clusters of small, white to pink flowers. The plant produces bright red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for native birds. Its foliage consists of alternate, simple leaves with a rough, hairy texture. Acaena ischnostemon is well adapted to the temperate climate of New Zealand and thrives in well-drained soils.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena ischnostemon is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury and Otago regions. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as shrublands and grasslands. It is commonly associated with limestone soils and is often found in areas with low rainfall. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within New Zealand's native flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena ischnostemon was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and potential for erosion control. It was commonly planted along roadsides and in gardens during the early 20th century. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly and outcompeting native vegetation in many areas. Its establishment is facilitated by its ability to produce large quantities of seeds and form dense stands. Despite its initial introduction for aesthetic and ecological purposes, it is now considered a noxious weed in several regions of New Zealand."
