    "intro": "Apargia sudetica, commonly known as the Sudetic bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to Central Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or streamside habitats. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
