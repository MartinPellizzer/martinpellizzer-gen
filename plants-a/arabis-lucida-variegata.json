    "intro": "Arabis lucida variegata, commonly known as the variegated rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features basal rosettes of dark green, slightly hairy leaves with striking white or yellow variegation. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and early blooming habit."
