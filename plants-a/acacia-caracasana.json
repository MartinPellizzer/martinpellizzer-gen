    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia caracasana is primarily native to South America, particularly in the countries of Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in a variety of habitats such as savannas, forests, and along riverbanks. This species thrives in areas with well-drained soils and a warm climate, often in regions with seasonal rainfall. It is an important plant in local ecosystems, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. Its distribution is largely restricted to the western part of the continent, where it plays a significant ecological role.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia caracasana was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and reforestation projects due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in various soil conditions. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions where it is used for landscaping and soil stabilization. The plant has also been introduced to some areas outside its native range, including parts of the southern United States and Southeast Asia. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a popular choice for erosion control and green space development. However, in certain regions, it has become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems."
