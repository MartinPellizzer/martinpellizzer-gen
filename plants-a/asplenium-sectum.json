    "intro": "Asplenium sectum, commonly known as the split fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a serrated or toothed margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Asplenium sectum is valued in horticulture for its ability to thrive in shaded environments and its unique, intricate foliage."
