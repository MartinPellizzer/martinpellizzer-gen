    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 pagesii nothosubsp. pagesii, commonly known as the hybrid shield fern, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually lance-shaped with a serrated margin, and the sori are clustered along the undersides of the leaves. This hybrid is notable for its ornamental value and its ability to adapt to a variety of soil conditions."
