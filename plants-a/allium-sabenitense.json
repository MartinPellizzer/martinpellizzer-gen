    "intro": "Allium sabenitense, commonly known as the desert garlic, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It produces small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and a bulbous root system, typical of many Allium species. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. The edible bulbs are often used in local cuisines and have a mild garlic-like flavor."
