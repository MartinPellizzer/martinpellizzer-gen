    "intro": "Arenaria sedifolia, commonly known as the common sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes, rock crevices, and disturbed areas. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are often clustered at the base, and its flowers are usually white or pink, arranged in dense clusters. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Arenaria sedifolia is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in challenging environments."
