It consists of several species, most notably Alsina ciliata, which is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. These plants are typically annual or biennial herbs with hairy stems and alternate leaves. The flowers are small and clustered in racemes, often with a distinctive yellow or greenish hue. Alsinanthus species are known for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making them valuable in ecological and agricultural contexts."
