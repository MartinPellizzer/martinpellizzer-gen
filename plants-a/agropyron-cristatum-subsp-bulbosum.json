    "intro": "Agropyron cristatum subsp. bulbosum, commonly known as the bulbous needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, spikelet-based flowers. The subspecies is notable for its ability to form bulbous structures, which aid in its survival in harsh environmental conditions."
