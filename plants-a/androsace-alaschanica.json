    "intro": "Androsace alaschanica, commonly known as the Alaskan sandpink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of pink or white flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its small stature and ability to survive in harsh conditions make it a resilient species in its native habitat. Androsace alaschanica is often found in high-altitude meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
