    "intro": "Acalypha gillmanii, commonly known as Gillman's spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is characterized by its milky sap and often showy floral structures. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, featuring simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to lanceolate in shape. Its flowers are small and clustered in cyathia, a unique structure typical of the spurge family. Acalypha gillmanii is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.",

This plant thrives in moist, tropical climates and is often seen in forested areas. It is known for its distinctive foliage and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. Its natural habitat includes riverine forests and coastal regions within Tanzania.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha gillmanii was mainly introduced to Hawaii. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in disturbed areas. The plant thrives in moist, sunny environments and spreads rapidly through seeds. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, prompting efforts to control its spread."
