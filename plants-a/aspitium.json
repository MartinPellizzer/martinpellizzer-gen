It consists of several species, primarily found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating. They produce small, greenish flowers that are clustered in umbels, and their fruits are follicles containing several seeds. Aspitium species are often found in woodland or grassland habitats, and some are considered ornamental in horticulture."
