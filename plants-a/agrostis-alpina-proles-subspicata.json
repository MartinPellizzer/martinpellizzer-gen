    "intro": "Agrostis alpina proles subspicata, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed florets. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in horticulture for erosion control and ornamental purposes."
