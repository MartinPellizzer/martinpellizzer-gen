    "intro": "Aquilaria tomentosa, commonly known as the white sand aquilaria, is a species of tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood and is often found in tropical rainforests. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers. Its unique properties make it valuable in the production of agarwood, a highly sought-after incense material. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species."
