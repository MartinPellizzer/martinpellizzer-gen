    "intro": "Arabis taihumilis, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important plants such as cabbages and mustard. This perennial herb typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces rounded, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. The plant is adapted to cold climates and is often found in areas with limited soil and harsh weather conditions."
