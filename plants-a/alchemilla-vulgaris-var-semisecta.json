    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. semisecta, commonly known as the lesser lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, silver-gray foliage with a distinctive waxy coating, and its leaves are deeply lobed, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, branching stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
