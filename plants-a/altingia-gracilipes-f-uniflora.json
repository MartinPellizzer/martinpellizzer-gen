    "intro": "Altingia gracilipes f. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flowered altingia, is a rare plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces a single, delicate flower per inflorescence, which is typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
