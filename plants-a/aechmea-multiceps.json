    "intro": "Aechmea multiceps, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients from the environment. The plant's foliage is typically dark green with a metallic sheen, and it produces vibrant orange or red flowers that emerge from the leaf axils. Aechmea multiceps thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor ornamental gardening."
