    "intro": "Abutilon membranifolium, commonly known as the velvetleaf abutilon, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its soft, fuzzy leaves that give it a velvety texture, and its showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Abutilon membranifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and vibrant blooms.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon membranifolium is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is found in regions such as California, Arizona, and New Mexico. This plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often associated with chaparral and desert scrub ecosystems. It thrives in areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its native range includes parts of Baja California and the Sonoran Desert region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon membranifolium was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in coastal and sandy environments. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, dunes, and construction sites. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions. Its rapid growth and extensive root system help prevent soil erosion and reduce wind-blown sand. However, it can become invasive in some areas if not managed properly."
