    "intro": "Artemisia caudata f. pubera, commonly known as the pubescent sagebrush, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flower heads that are typically clustered in dense, flat-topped clusters. Native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
