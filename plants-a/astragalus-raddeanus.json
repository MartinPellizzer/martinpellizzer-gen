    "intro": "Astragalus raddeanus, commonly known as the Siberian milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the cold climates of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Astragalus raddeanus is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in arid and nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
