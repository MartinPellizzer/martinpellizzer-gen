    "intro": "Anthocleista kamerunensis, commonly known as the Cameroon moonseed, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and West Africa. It belongs to the family Loganiaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that help it ascend trees and other vegetation. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by elliptical, smooth fruits containing flat, kidney-shaped seeds. Its leaves are typically alternate, simple, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Anthocleista kamerunensis is valued for its medicinal properties, with various parts of the plant used in traditional African medicine."
