    "intro": "Aira lagopoides, commonly known as the meadow foxtail, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in open fields, meadows, and along roadsides. The plant produces distinctive spikelets that resemble a fox's tail, giving it its common name. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Aira lagopoides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
