    "intro": "Acropogon horarius, commonly known as the slender grass or narrow-leaved grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family, Poaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is typically found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and grasslands. Acropogon horarius is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil.",
