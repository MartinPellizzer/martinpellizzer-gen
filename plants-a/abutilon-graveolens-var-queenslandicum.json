    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon graveolens var. queenslandicum is primarily native to eastern Australia, specifically Queensland and New South Wales. It is commonly found in coastal and inland regions, including sandy soils and open woodlands. This plant thrives in a range of habitats, including heathlands and coastal dunes. It is often associated with the coastal areas of northern and eastern Australia. The species is well adapted to the temperate to subtropical climates of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon graveolens var. queenslandicum was mainly introduced to Australia as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and showy flowers. It has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the eastern and northern parts of the country. The plant is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides, where it thrives in warm, sunny conditions. Its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to invade native habitats and compete with local flora. Despite its ornamental value, efforts are being made to monitor and manage its distribution to prevent ecological disruption."
