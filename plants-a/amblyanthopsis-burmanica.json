    "intro": "Amblyanthopsis burmanica, commonly known as the Burmese cycad, is a unique cycad species native to Myanmar. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a rare and ecologically significant species. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, it is also considered vulnerable to extinction."
