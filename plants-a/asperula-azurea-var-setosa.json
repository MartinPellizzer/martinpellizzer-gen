It features small, dark green, leathery leaves that are densely arranged along the stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its dense foliage makes it an effective ground cover plant in horticultural settings."
