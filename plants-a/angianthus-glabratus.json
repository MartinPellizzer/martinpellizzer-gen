    "intro": "Angianthus glabratus, commonly known as the smooth angianthus, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in spring. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside its native range."
