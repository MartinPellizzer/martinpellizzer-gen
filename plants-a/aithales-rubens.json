    "intro": "Aithales rubens, commonly known as the red-flowered tundra plant, is a flowering plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and showy, bright red flowers. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its growth is slow, and it often forms dense mats on rocky or barren ground. Aithales rubens plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small Arctic animals."
