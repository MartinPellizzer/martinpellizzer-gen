    "intro": "Asperula microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved woodruff, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western Europe. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Asperula microphylla produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
