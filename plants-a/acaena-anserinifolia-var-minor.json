    "intro": "Acaena anserinifolia var. minor, commonly known as the small silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to New Zealand. It features dense clusters of small, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, which later develop into spiny, berry-like structures. Its growth habit is mat-forming, with creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. This species is well adapted to harsh environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena anserinifolia var. minor is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury and Otago regions. This variety thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is commonly associated with disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in river valleys. The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate of New Zealand and is an important component of local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena anserinifolia var. minor was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. However, it is not considered invasive and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems."
