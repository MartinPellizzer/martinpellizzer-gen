    "intro": "Angraecoides, commonly known as the star orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to Madagascar and are characterized by their striking, star-shaped flowers that are often fragrant. Angraecoides species typically have long, slender petals and a distinctive, intricate floral structure. They are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees or rocks rather than in soil. Due to their unique appearance and habitat, they are highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts and botanists alike."
