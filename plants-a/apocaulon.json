    "intro": "Apocaulon, commonly known as the \"bushy sandmat,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are characterized by their upright, branching stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Apocaulon species typically grow in sandy or gravelly soils and are adapted to drought conditions. They are often used in xeriscaping due to their low water requirements and ornamental value."
