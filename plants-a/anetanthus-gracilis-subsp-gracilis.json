    "intro": "Anetanthus gracilis subsp. gracilis, commonly known as slender marsh orchid, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, featuring slender stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in wet meadows and along the edges of ponds. Anetanthus gracilis subsp. gracilis is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, with rhizomes that help it survive seasonal flooding."
