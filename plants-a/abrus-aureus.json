It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrus aureus was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and ornamental plant trade. It is commonly found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in urban environments where it thrives in disturbed soils. The plant is known for its vibrant orange flowers and distinctive seed pods, making it a popular choice for gardeners. However, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation. Its distribution has expanded beyond its native range due to its adaptability and ease of cultivation."
