    "intro": "Aeluropus pubescens, commonly known as the hairy saltgrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It typically grows in saline soils and is often found in salt marshes and dunes. Aeluropus pubescens plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
