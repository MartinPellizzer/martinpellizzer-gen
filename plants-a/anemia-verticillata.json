    "intro": "Anemia verticillata, commonly known as the spiral rush, is a perennial herb native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its helically twisted stems that give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters at the base of the stems, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often growing in a rosette pattern near the ground. Anemia verticillata is adapted to moist soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
