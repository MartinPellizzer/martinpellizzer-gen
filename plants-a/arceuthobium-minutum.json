    "intro": "Arceuthobium minutum, commonly known as the dwarf broomrape, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of grasses or other flowering plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a unique method of seed dispersal, where the seeds are propelled by a mechanism triggered by touch. It is found in various parts of the world, including North America and Europe, often in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its parasitic nature and limited host range, it plays a minor role in ecological systems but is of interest to botanists studying plant interactions."
