    "intro": "Acantholimon reflexifolium, commonly known as the reflexed leaf thrift, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant has silver-gray foliage with reflexed (bent backward) leaf tips, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and dune environments. Due to its limited range and susceptibility to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon reflexifolium is primarily native to Turkey. This plant is found in specific regions of Turkey, particularly in the eastern and central parts of the country. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing in mountainous areas. The species is adapted to the dry and harsh conditions typical of its native habitat. It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is known for its unique foliage and flowering characteristics.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon reflexifolium was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in coastal or inland regions with a Mediterranean climate. It thrives in environments where there is limited water availability and moderate temperatures. This plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in abandoned fields. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, including gardening and land development. However, it is considered a non-native species that can sometimes outcompete native flora in certain ecosystems."
