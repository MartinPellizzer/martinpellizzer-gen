    "intro": "Arundo tenax, commonly known as giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its rigid, hollow stems and narrow, linear leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant is highly adaptable, thriving in wet or moist environments such as riverbanks and marshes. It produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, it is often considered an invasive species in non-native habitats."
