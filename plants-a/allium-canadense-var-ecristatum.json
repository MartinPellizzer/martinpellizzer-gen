    "intro": "Allium canadense var. ecristatum, commonly known as the Canada bunching onion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features a basal rosette of broad, smooth, grass-like leaves that are often used in culinary applications. The plant produces a cluster of small, white or pale purple flowers on a hollow stem, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its lack of a prominent bulb, setting it apart from other Allium species."
