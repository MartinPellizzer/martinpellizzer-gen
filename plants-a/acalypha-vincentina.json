    "intro": "Acalypha vincentina, commonly known as Vincent's spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with milky sap. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with hairy, lance-shaped leaves.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha vincentina is primarily native to the Pacific Islands, including parts of Hawaii, Tahiti, and other islands in the tropical Pacific region. It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests where it thrives in warm, humid climates. This plant is often associated with disturbed soils and can be seen growing along roadsides and in open habitats. Its distribution is limited to specific islands where it has adapted to the unique environmental conditions. Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha vincentina was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was likely brought by horticulturalists or gardeners seeking to add visual interest to tropical landscapes. The plant has since become naturalized in some areas, spreading through both seed dispersal and vegetative propagation. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in certain ecosystems. Despite its aesthetic appeal, management efforts are underway to control its spread in invaded habitats."
