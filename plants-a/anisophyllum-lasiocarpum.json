    "intro": "Anisophyllum lasiocarpum, commonly known as the woolly fruit anisophyllum, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and unique fruit structures. It is native to the mountainous regions of western North America, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant features compound leaves with finely divided lobes and produces small, hairy fruits that are adapted for wind dispersal. Its botanical structure reflects evolutionary adaptations to its alpine environment, including compact growth and frost resistance. Anisophyllum lasiocarpum is often found in open habitats such as meadows and slopes, contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
