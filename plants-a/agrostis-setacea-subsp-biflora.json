    "intro": "Agrostis setacea subsp. biflora, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with two to three flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
