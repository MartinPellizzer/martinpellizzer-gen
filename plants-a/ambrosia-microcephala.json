    "intro": "Ambrosia microcephala, commonly known as the lesser ragweed, is an annual flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its small, yellow-green flowers that appear in late summer and early fall. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces a large number of lightweight seeds that are easily dispersed by the wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Ambrosia microcephala is a significant allergen, contributing to seasonal allergies due to its pollen."
