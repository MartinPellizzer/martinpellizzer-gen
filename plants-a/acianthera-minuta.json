    "intro": "Acianthera minuta, commonly known as the tiny orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, miniature flowers that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base. Its flowers are usually pale green or white with a faintly colored lip, and they bloom during the warmer months. Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is a challenging plant to cultivate outside its natural environment.",
