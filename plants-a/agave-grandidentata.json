    "intro": "Agave grandidentata, commonly known as the giant desert rat's tail, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a white, powdery coating. The plant produces large, spiky flower stalks that can reach several meters in height, bearing yellow flowers that bloom once in its lifetime. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and leaves. Agave grandidentata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used by indigenous peoples for various purposes."
