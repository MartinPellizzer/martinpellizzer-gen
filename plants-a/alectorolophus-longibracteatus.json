    "intro": "Alectorolophus longibracteatus, commonly known as the long-bract alectorolophus, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Amaranthaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces distinctive bracts that are elongated and often brightly colored, serving both protective and attractive functions. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This species is native to regions of Africa and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
