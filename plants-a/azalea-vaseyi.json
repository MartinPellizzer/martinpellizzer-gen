    "intro": "Azalea vaseyi, commonly known as the Vasey's azalea, is a species native to the eastern United States, particularly Georgia and South Carolina. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, broad, ovate leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Azalea vaseyi thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is complemented by its role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife."
