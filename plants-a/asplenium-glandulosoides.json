    "intro": "Asplenium glandulosoides, commonly known as the glandular spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and dark green, lanceolate leaves with a distinctive glandular texture on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rock crevices or forest floors, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered clusters on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns. Asplenium glandulosoides is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
