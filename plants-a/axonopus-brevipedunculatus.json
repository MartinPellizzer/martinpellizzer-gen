It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, often forming dense mats near water bodies. The plant has slender, creeping stems with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of short, clustered spikelets that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Axonopus brevipedunculatus is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
