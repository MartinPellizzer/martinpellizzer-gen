    "intro": "Allium sphaeropodum, commonly known as the globe onion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy, bulbous leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, onion-like flavor, often used in local cuisines. Allium sphaeropodum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
