    "intro": "Agropyron concinnum, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky slopes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to yellowish flowers. Agropyron concinnum is adapted to harsh, arid environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It is valued for its resilience and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils."
