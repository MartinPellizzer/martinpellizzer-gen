    "intro": "Aphelia nutans, commonly known as the drooping lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear narrow, lance-shaped leaves arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive downward-curving shape. Aphelia nutans thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it an attractive addition to native plant gardens and wetland restoration projects."
