    "intro": "Anthericum pubescens, commonly known as the woolly nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, hairy stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, covered in fine, soft pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped, with a serrated margin and a hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
