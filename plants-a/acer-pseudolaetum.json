    "intro": "Acer pseudolaetum, commonly known as the white maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by winged seeds dispersed by the wind. Its growth habit is typically rounded, with a symmetrical shape that makes it a popular ornamental tree. The white maple is relatively easy to care for, making it suitable for gardens and urban landscapes.",
