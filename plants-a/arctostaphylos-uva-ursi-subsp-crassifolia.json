    "intro": "Arctostaphylos uva-ursi subsp. crassifolia, commonly known as bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to arid and rocky habitats in North America. It features small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a whitish waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. The subspecies is distinguished by its thick, fleshy leaves and is often used in traditional medicine for its antimicrobial properties."
