    "intro": "Acer pseudoplatanus var. dittrichii, commonly known as the Giant Maple, is a variant of the common maple that exhibits striking botanical features. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter, showcasing a vibrant green color in summer and fiery red or orange in autumn. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its impressive size and seasonal color changes. This variety is relatively slow-growing but can develop into a substantial tree with a broad, spreading canopy.",
