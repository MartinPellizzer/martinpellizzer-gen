    "intro": "Aralia acerifolia, commonly known as the Japanese aralia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan and Korea. It is characterized by its palmately compound leaves, which resemble those of maple trees, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbels, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its unique foliage and adaptability contribute to its appeal in both landscape design and botanical study."
