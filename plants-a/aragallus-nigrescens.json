    "intro": "Aragallus nigrescens, commonly known as the black-flowered aragallus, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its dark purple to black flowers, which contrast sharply with its green foliage. The plant belongs to the family Polygonaceae, commonly known as the buckwheat family. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
