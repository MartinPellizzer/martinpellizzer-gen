    "intro": "Aphyllocladus denticulatus var. denticulatus, commonly known as the toothed sandmat, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fleshy, ribbed leaves that are typically green with a slightly toothed margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. It is well adapted to hot, dry environments and requires minimal water once established. Due to its resilience and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaping and rock gardens."
