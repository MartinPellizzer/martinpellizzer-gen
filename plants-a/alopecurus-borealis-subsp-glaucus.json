It typically grows in moist, temperate habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, tufted shoots with narrow, blue-green blades that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
