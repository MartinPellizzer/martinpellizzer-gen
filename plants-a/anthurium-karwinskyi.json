    "intro": "Anthurium karwinskyi, commonly known as the red anthurium, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped spathe that ranges in color from deep red to orange, often with a contrasting green spadix. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Its foliage consists of large, waxy, dark green leaves that contribute to its ornamental appeal. Anthurium karwinskyi is popular as a houseplant due to its long-lasting blooms and air-purifying qualities."
