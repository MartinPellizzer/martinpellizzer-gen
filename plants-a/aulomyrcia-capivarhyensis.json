    "intro": "Aulomyrcia capivarhyensis, commonly known as the Capivarhy River fern, is a rare and endemic fern species found in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments along riverbanks and in humid forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
