    "intro": "Armeriastrum ulicinum, commonly known as the coastal sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Armeriastrum ulicinum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
