    "intro": "Anthistiria glabrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf anthistiria, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its smooth, hairless leaves and compact growth habit make it easily distinguishable from related species. Anthistiria glabrifolia is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
