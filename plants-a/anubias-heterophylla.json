    "intro": "Anubias heterophylla, commonly known as the variable anubia, is a hardy aquatic plant native to Africa. It is characterized by its broad, dark green leaves that can vary in shape and size depending on light conditions. This plant is often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, allowing it to colonize areas effectively. Anubias heterophylla is popular in aquascaping due to its aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements."
