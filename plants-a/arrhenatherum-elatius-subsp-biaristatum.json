    "intro": "Arrhenatherum elatius subsp. biaristatum, commonly known as the slender wood oat, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. The plant features tall, slender culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-lipped flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
