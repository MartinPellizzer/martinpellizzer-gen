    "intro": "Aconitum acutiusculum var. acutiusculum, commonly known as the sharp-leaved monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking blue to purple flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape, typical of the genus Aconitum. The plant has palmately lobed leaves with a distinctive, almost spade-shaped appearance. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.",
