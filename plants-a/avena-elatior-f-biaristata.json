    "intro": "Avena elatior f. biaristata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf oat, is a variant of the oat species characterized by its slender, elongated leaves. This form exhibits a more compact growth habit compared to the typical oat plant, with shorter and narrower leaves that are often more upright. The inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are arranged in a loose, branched structure. It produces small, two-lobed flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. This botanical form is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to a variety of soil conditions."
