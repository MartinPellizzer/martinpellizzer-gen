    "intro": "Ardisia maingayi, commonly known as the Philippine evergreen ardisia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub native to the Philippines. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters and features glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Ardisia maingayi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal fruit."
