    "intro": "Artemisia albula, commonly known as white sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of aromatic, narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Artemisia albula is often used in traditional medicine and spiritual practices due to its strong, pungent scent. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping."
