    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris subsp. plicata, commonly known as the zigzag plant, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread easily, forming dense colonies in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along stream banks."
