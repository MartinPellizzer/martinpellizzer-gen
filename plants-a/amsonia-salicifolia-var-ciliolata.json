    "intro": "Amsonia salicifolia var. ciliolata, commonly known as the silky bluetail, is a perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are softly hairy along the edges, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of blue to sky-blue flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by fluffy, seed-bearing heads. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and long-lasting floral display."
