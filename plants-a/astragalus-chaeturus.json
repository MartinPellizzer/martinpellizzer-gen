    "intro": "Astragalus chaeturus, commonly known as the Tibetan milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia, including Tibet, Mongolia, and northern China. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, bean-shaped pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Astragalus chaeturus is adapted to harsh, arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
