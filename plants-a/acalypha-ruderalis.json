It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in disturbed habitats like roadsides, fields, and waste areas. This species is well adapted to thrive in environments with poor soil conditions and can quickly colonize open spaces. Its native range extends across parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands as well. It is an important pioneer species in ecological succession.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha ruderalis was mainly introduced to disturbed habitats such as roadsides, waste areas, and abandoned fields. It thrives in environments with poor soil quality and full sunlight. This plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open spaces quickly. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its competitive nature. Its distribution has expanded significantly in areas with human activity and land disturbance."
