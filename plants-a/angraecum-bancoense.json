    "intro": "Angraecum bancoense, commonly known as the Banko orchid, is a species of orchid native to the rainforests of Madagascar. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of fragrant, white flowers with long, slender petals. The plant typically blooms during the rainy season, producing showy inflorescences that attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its epiphytic growth habit allows it to thrive on tree trunks and branches in humid, shaded environments. Angraecum bancoense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by enthusiasts for its unique floral display."
