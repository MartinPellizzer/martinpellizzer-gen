    "intro": "Apocopis floccosus, commonly known as the fluffcap mushroom, is a species of fungus characterized by its distinctive, fluffy cap that resembles a cloud. It belongs to the family Hygrocybaceae and is typically found in temperate forests, often growing in association with decaying wood. The cap is usually pale yellow to cream in color, with a soft, velvety texture that becomes more pronounced as the fungus matures. The gills are initially pale and gradually turn a deeper yellow, while the stem is slender and often slightly bulbous at the base. This species is notable for its unique appearance and is often sought after by mushroom enthusiasts for its aesthetic appeal."
