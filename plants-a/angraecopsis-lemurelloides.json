    "intro": "Angraecopsis lemurelloides, commonly known as the Lemurelloides orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom at night. The plant is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat, with specialized structures for moisture retention. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by moths, a unique ecological relationship that highlights its evolutionary adaptations. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native region."
