    "intro": "Amorphophallus kerrii, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in diameter, providing a large surface area for photosynthesis. The plant's most notable feature is its massive, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the early morning and emit a strong odor resembling rotting meat. These flowers are typically short-lived, opening for only a few days before closing. Amorphophallus kerrii thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds."
