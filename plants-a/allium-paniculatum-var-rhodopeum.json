    "intro": "[WRONG START] Allium paniculatum var. rhodopaeum, commonly known as the Rhodope onion, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Rhodope Mountains in Bulgaria. It features basal leaves that are strap-shaped and gray-green in color, with a dense, spherical inflorescence composed of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces spherical, fleshy bulbs that are often used as ornamental plants in gardens due to their striking appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, and is drought-tolerant once established. This variety is valued for its ornamental value and its ability to naturalize in suitable climates."
