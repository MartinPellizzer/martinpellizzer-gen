    "intro": "Astragalus hamosus subsp. brachyceras, commonly known as the short-horned milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender, branched stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which are characteristic of the Fabaceae family. Its compound leaves are pinnately divided, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. This subspecies is adapted to dry conditions, with deep taproots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils."
