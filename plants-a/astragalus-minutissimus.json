    "intro": "Astragalus minutissimus, commonly known as the dwarf milkvetch, is a small, flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tiny, yellow flowers and delicate, trifoliate leaves. This species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. Astragalus minutissimus is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root system. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
