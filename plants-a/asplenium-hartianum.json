    "intro": "Asplenium hartianum, commonly known as Hart's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and features dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rock crevices or on tree trunks, and is often found in temperate regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, circular clusters on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium hartianum is a hardy plant that is relatively easy to cultivate, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
