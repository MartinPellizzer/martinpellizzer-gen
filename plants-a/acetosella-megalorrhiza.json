    "intro": "Acetosella megalorrhiza, commonly known as the large-rooted sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb belonging to the family Geraniaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, calcareous soils. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. Acetosella megalorrhiza is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments.",
