    "intro": "Antiaris toxicaria subsp. toxicaria, commonly known as the giant arrowroot, is a large, evergreen shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically broad and elliptical in shape. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red fruits containing toxic seeds. It is notable for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. However, due to the presence of toxic compounds in its sap and seeds, it requires caution when handling or consuming."
