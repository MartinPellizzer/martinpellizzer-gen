It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are typically borne on slender peduncles. Its roots are fibrous and have been traditionally used in local medicine for their purported healing properties. Acronema cryptosciadeum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.",
