    "intro": "Agropyron cristatum subsp. sibiricum, commonly known as Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps stabilize soil. The plant produces spikelet-like inflorescences with awned lemmas, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its hardy nature makes it a valuable plant for erosion control and forage in arid environments."
