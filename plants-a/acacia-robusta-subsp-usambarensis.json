    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia robusta subsp. usambarensis is primarily native to eastern and central Africa, including countries such as Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, and parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is commonly found in savanna woodlands, dry forests, and along riverbanks. This subspecies thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with open habitats and can tolerate seasonal droughts. Its native range extends into parts of southern Sudan and northern Zambia as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia robusta subsp. usambarensis was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in regions with tropical and subtropical climates. It is commonly found in Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina, where it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. This subspecies has been used for its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil in degraded areas. However, its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain environments. Despite its ecological benefits, careful management is required to prevent unintended spread."
