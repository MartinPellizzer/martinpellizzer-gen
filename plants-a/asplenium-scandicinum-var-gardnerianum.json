It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit, often using tendrils to ascend trees or other structures. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a serrated margin, and its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The varietal form, gardnerianum, is distinguished by specific leaf morphology and growth patterns compared to the typical species."
