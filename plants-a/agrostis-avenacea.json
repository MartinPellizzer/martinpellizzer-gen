It typically grows in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are often used in forage and erosion control due to its hardy nature. Botanically, it is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
