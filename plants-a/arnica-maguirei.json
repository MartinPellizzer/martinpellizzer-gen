It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
