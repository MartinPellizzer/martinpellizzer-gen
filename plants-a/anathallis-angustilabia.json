    "intro": "Anathallis angustilabia, commonly known as the narrow-lipped anathallis, is a species of orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a loose inflorescence. The plant has a unique floral structure with a short, narrow labellum that distinguishes it from other members of the Anathallis genus. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or along riverbanks. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
