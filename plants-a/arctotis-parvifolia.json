    "intro": "Arctotis parvifolia, commonly known as the small-flowered arctotis, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces clusters of small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the summer months. It has narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. Arctotis parvifolia is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
