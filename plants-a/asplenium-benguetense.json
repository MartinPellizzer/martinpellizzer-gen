    "intro": "Asplenium benguetense, commonly known as the Benguet spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with dense, dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are often clustered at the base. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typically in clusters near the edges. Asplenium benguetense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens."
