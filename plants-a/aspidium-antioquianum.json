    "intro": "Aspidium antioquianum, commonly known as the Antioquian water fern, is a species of fern native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in moist soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, and it plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat."
