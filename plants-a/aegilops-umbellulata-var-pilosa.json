    "intro": "Aegilops umbellulata var. pilosa, commonly known as the woolly wild oat, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its fibrous roots and robust stems make it a hardy plant adapted to dry, disturbed soils. It is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, contributing to soil stabilization and ecological diversity."
