    "intro": "Acaena ovalifolia var. subtuspellita, commonly known as the narrow-leaved burr bush, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces distinctive, spiky burrs that contain seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by attaching to animals. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland shrublands. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native wildlife.",

This variety thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils. It is commonly associated with coastal dunes and other disturbed habitats. The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate and maritime conditions of New Zealand.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena ovalifolia var. subtuspellita was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the early European colonization efforts. This plant is considered an invasive species in certain regions of New Zealand. It spreads rapidly and can outcompete native vegetation. Its distribution is now widespread across various habitats in the country."
