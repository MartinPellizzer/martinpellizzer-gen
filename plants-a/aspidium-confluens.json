    "intro": "Aspidium confluens, commonly known as the clustered water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green and have a soft, leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium. Aspidium confluens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
