It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces umbels of white or pale purple flowers. The plant is characterized by its strong garlic scent and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Allium ponticum thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. It is also valued for its edible bulbs, which have a pungent flavor similar to garlic."
