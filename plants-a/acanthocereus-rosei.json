    "intro": "Acanthocereus rosei, commonly known as the night blooming cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. Its foliage is reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique blooming behavior.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthocereus rosei is primarily native to Mexico Northwest and Mexico Southwest. This species is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of these areas. It thrives in desert environments with low rainfall and high sunlight exposure. The plant is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. It is commonly found in rocky soils and along rocky outcrops in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthocereus rosei was mainly introduced to the southern United States, particularly in Texas and Arizona, as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and cold hardiness. It is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions because of its ability to thrive in well-drained soils and minimal water requirements. The plant has been reported in several states, including California and Nevada, where it has occasionally become naturalized in disturbed areas. Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential to spread in native ecosystems. Despite its ornamental value, Acanthocereus rosei is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
