    "intro": "Andropogon neesii subvar. leianthus, commonly known as the slender bluestem, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or grassy areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a potential candidate for ecological restoration projects."
