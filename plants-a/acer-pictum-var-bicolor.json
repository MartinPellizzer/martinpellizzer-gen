    "intro": "Acer pictum var. bicolor, commonly known as the twinleaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which are divided into two pairs of lobes, giving it its common name. The leaves display a striking color change, turning bright yellow in the fall, which adds to its ornamental value. It typically grows to a height of 10 to 20 feet and prefers moist, well-drained soils. This species is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in shady, humid conditions.",
