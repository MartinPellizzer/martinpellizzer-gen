    "intro": "Anisomeles secunda, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, tree-like appearance with a central stem and branching fronds that resemble antlers, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid environments and requires indirect sunlight to flourish. Its roots anchor to tree trunks or other surfaces, and it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Anisomeles secunda is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
