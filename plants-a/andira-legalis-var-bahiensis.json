    "intro": "Andira legalis var. bahiensis, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically red when ripe. It is valued for its hard, dense wood, which is used in the crafting of musical instruments and fine furniture. Due to its slow growth and high demand, it is also considered a threatened species in its native habitat."
