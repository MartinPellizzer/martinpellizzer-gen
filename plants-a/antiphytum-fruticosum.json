    "intro": "Antiphytum fruticosum, commonly known as the creeping sandverbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming during the cooler months. Its fibrous root system allows it to anchor firmly in sandy or rocky soils. Antiphytum fruticosum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
