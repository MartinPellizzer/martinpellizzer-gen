    "intro": "Artemisia lasiocline, commonly known as roughleaf wormwood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, stiff hairs that give it a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in complex inflorescences, typical of the Asteraceae family. Artemisia lasiocline thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or arid environments. It is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine for its antiseptic and digestive benefits."
