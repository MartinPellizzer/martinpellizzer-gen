    "intro": "Adiantum monochlamys var. plurisorum, commonly known as the variable maidenhair fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are slender and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly across the forest floor. The varietal name \"plurisorum\" refers to the presence of multiple sorus types on its fronds, a distinguishing feature in its taxonomy.",
