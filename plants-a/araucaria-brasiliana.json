    "intro": "Araucaria brasiliana, commonly known as the Brazilian Araucaria, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, conical crown composed of needle-like leaves. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy, orange-red aril, which is an adaptation for animal dispersal. Its foliage is dark green and glossy, providing a striking visual contrast against its bark, which is smooth and often grayish-brown. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting a variety of wildlife and contributing to forest biodiversity."
