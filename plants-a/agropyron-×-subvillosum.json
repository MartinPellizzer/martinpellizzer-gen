    "intro": "Agropyron \u00d7 subvillosum, commonly known as the sand wheatgrass, is a hybrid grass species native to the northern regions of the United States and Canada. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, slightly hairy leaves that help it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, two-lobed spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and dunes. Its adaptability makes it an important species for erosion control and habitat restoration in arid and semi-arid regions."
