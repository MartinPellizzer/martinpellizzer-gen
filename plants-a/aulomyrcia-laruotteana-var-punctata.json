    "intro": "Aulomyrcia laruotteana var. punctata, commonly known as the spotted aulomyrcia, is a rare shrub native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often marked with distinctive spots or streaks. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found in humid tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
