    "intro": "Axonopus kuhlmannii, commonly known as the narrowleaf axonopus, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forest floors and wetlands. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. Its flowering stems produce small, inconspicuous inflorescences, and it reproduces primarily through rhizomes. Axonopus kuhlmannii is often used in ornamental horticulture for its dense, low-growing foliage."
