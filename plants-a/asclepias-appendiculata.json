    "intro": "Asclepias appendiculata, commonly known as the appendiculate milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces follicles that contain toxic, milky sap, which is a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Asclepias appendiculata is an important host plant for the larvae of several butterfly species, including the monarch and queen butterflies."
