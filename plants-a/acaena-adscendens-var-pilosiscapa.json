This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as tussock grasslands and rocky outcrops. It is well adapted to the local climate and soil conditions of these areas. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within New Zealand.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena adscendens var. pilosiscapa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. This plant is commonly found in coastal and inland areas, particularly in disturbed soils. It has become naturalized and is now considered a weed in some regions. Its spread is facilitated by its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
