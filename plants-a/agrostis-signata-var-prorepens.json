    "intro": "Agrostis signata var. prorepens, commonly known as the creeping bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to North America. It features fine, dark green blades that form a dense mat, often found in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is widely used in turfgrass applications due to its durability and ability to withstand foot traffic. Its botanical characteristics make it adaptable to a variety of environmental conditions."
