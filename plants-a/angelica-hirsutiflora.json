    "intro": "Angelica hirsutiflora, commonly known as the hairy-flowered angelica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, adorned with large, umbrella-shaped compound leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its rhizomatous root system makes it a hardy plant capable of thriving in well-drained, moist soils. Angelica hirsutiflora is valued in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
