    "intro": "Aethionema saxatile var. monospermum, commonly known as the single-seed saxatile aethionema, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to rocky and arid environments in the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, rounded seeds that are typically dispersed by wind, aiding in its colonization of harsh landscapes. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system and succulent leaves that store water. This variety is distinguished by its unique monospermous fruit, containing a single seed, which is a notable feature in its taxonomic classification."
