    "intro": "Anemone rigida, commonly known as the rigid anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features showy, white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has a robust root system and stout, hairy stems that remain upright throughout the growing season. Its leaves are alternate, palmately lobed, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. Anemone rigida thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly areas at high elevations."
