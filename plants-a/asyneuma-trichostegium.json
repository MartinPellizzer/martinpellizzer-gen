It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Asyneuma trichostegium is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils, making it an invasive species in some areas. Its botanical features make it adaptable to a variety of environmental conditions, contributing to its widespread distribution."
