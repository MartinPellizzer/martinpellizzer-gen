    "intro": "Astragalus glochideus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and arid environments. The plant features compound leaves with small, spine-like structures called glochids, which are characteristic of the genus Astragalus. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces small, bean-like pods that contain seeds. Astragalus glochideus is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
