    "intro": "Arenaria glaucovirens, commonly known as the silver sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant's leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, giving it a silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Arenaria glaucovirens is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in difficult conditions."
