    "intro": "Aspidium trimenii, commonly known as the Malayan shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Aspidium trimenii thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing in forest undergrowth where it can access the necessary moisture and light."
