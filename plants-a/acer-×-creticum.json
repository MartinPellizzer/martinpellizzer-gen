    "intro": "Acer \u00d7 creticum, commonly known as the hybrid maple, is a deciduous tree resulting from the cross between Acer saccharum (sugar maple) and Acer rubrum (red maple). It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with heart-shaped leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of 15\u201325 meters, featuring a broad, rounded canopy. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adaptable to a variety of soil types, making it a popular ornamental tree in temperate climates.",
