    "intro": "Aquilegia formosa var. formosa, commonly known as the Western columbine, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features striking blue to purple spurred petals and bright yellow anthers, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with compound leaves that are palmately arranged. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its botanical name reflects its historical association with the genus Aquilegia, which is derived from the Latin word for eagle, referring to the shape of its flowers."
