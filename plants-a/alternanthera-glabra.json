    "intro": "Alternanthera glabra, commonly known as red sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South America. It features small, fleshy leaves that are often red or purple in color, especially when exposed to full sun. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in water gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage rather than its flowers."
