    "intro": "Anaphalis prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate goatweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically forms dense mats of silver-gray foliage, with hairy stems that help reduce water loss in dry environments. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often arranged in clusters that resemble a tuft of down. Anaphalis prostrata is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
