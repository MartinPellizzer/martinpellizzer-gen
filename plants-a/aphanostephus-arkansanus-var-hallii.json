    "intro": "Aphanostephus arkansanus var. hallii, commonly known as Hall's sandburs, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with wiry stems and small, spiny bracts that form the characteristic burrs. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, followed by the development of its distinctive, hooked seed pods. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas such as fields and roadsides. Due to its hardy nature and adaptability, it is considered a common weed in many regions."
