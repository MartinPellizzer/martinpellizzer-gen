    "intro": "Actinostemma parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved actinostemmatum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic plants such as carrots and parsley. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.",
