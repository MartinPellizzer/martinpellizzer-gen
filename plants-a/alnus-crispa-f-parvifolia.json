    "intro": "Alnus crispa f. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often near streams or in forested areas. The leaves are finely serrated, small, and have a pale green underside, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. This plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
