    "intro": "Abutilon pubistamineum, commonly known as the woolly abutilon, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its soft, fuzzy leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a velvety texture, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in well-drained soils. Abutilon pubistamineum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in warm climates.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon pubistamineum is primarily native to Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela. This species is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these countries. It thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. The plant is often seen growing in forest understories or along riverbanks. Its native distribution is closely linked to the diverse ecosystems of South America's Andean and Amazonian regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon pubistamineum was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species. It was likely introduced through human activity, such as accidental transport via shipping or intentional planting for ornamental purposes. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and can outcompete native vegetation, leading to ecological imbalances. It is often found in coastal regions and disturbed habitats across the Hawaiian Islands. Efforts to control its spread include manual removal and herbicide application."
