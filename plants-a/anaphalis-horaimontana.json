It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble single blooms. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, high-altitude environments. Its silver-gray foliage and fluffy, white capitula make it visually distinctive. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as habitat for small invertebrates."
