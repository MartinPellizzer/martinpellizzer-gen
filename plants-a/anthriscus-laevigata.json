    "intro": "Anthriscus laevigata, commonly known as cow parsley, is a biennial or perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are soft to the touch and often covered in a fine white down. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Anthriscus laevigata is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and also serves as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
