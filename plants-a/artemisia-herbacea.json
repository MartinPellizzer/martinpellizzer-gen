    "intro": "Artemisia herbacea, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in compact clusters during the summer months. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes many other aromatic herbs and flowering plants. Artemisia herbacea is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils due to its strong, distinctive scent."
