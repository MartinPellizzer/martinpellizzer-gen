    "intro": "Allocarya glyptocarpa subsp. modesta, commonly known as the modest spiny lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Chile. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking, showy flowers with a distinctive spiny structure on the petals. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its flowering period typically occurs in the spring, and it is adapted to the arid and temperate climates of its native habitat. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
