    "intro": "Aria ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically light green with a smooth texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in spikes at the top of the stems. It thrives in moist to wet soil and partial to full sun, making it a common sight in swampy areas. Aria ambigua is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
