    "intro": "Amoria caespitosa, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with numerous small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are dense and form a carpet-like ground cover. Amoria caespitosa is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
