    "intro": "Asplenium otophorum, commonly known as the ear-fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble a cluster of ears, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Asplenium otophorum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in a variety of soil types when provided with adequate moisture."
