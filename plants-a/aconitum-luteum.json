    "intro": "Aconitum luteum, commonly known as the yellow monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking purple and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veining pattern. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value.",
