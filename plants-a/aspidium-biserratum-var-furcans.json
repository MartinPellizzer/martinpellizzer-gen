    "intro": "Aspidium biserratum var. furcans, commonly known as the forked water fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed water fern native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate fronds that split into forked segments, giving it a unique appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water bodies such as streams and ponds. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a key feature in its reproductive biology."
