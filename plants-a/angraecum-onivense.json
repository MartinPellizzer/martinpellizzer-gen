    "intro": "Angraecum onivense, commonly known as the snow orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its white, fragrant flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically from September to December. The plant features long, slender pseudobulbs and narrow, grass-like leaves that help it conserve water in its arid habitat. It is epiphytic, meaning it grows on trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, Angraecum onivense is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
