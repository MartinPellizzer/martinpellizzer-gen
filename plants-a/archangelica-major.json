    "intro": "Archangelica major, commonly known as hogweed, is a tall biennial or perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, umbrella-shaped compound leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white or greenish-yellow flowers in late summer, which are followed by dark, spherical berries. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils along riverbanks and roadsides. Due to its toxic sap and phototoxic effects, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
