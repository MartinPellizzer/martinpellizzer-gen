    "intro": "Artemisia ludoviciana subsp. redolens, commonly known as sweet wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late summer. The plant is known for its strong, distinctive scent, which is due to the presence of volatile compounds such as thujone and camphor. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats like prairies and rocky slopes. This subspecies is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its historical use in traditional medicine."
