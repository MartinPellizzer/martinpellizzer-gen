    "intro": "Acacia velutina f. ferox, commonly known as the hairy acacia, is a variant of the acacia species native to Africa. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has feathery, bipinnate leaves that are covered in a soft, velvety pubescence. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in savannas and rocky areas. The species is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia velutina f. ferox is primarily native to northern Australia, including regions of Queensland and the Northern Territory. This shrub or small tree thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in open woodlands and rocky outcrops. It is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the continent, with its deep root system allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. The plant is also occasionally found in southern New Guinea, extending its native range slightly beyond Australia. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native fauna.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia velutina f. ferox was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and for its hardy nature in arid environments. It is commonly found in regions with low rainfall and poor soil quality. This plant has been widely used in reforestation projects due to its ability to thrive in challenging conditions. However, its invasive potential has raised concerns in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation. Its distribution is now expanding beyond its original range due to human activities and climate changes."
