    "intro": "Asplenium serra var. tomentosa, commonly known as the hairy serrate spleenwort, is a variant of the serrate spleenwort, a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in moist, shaded environments. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and its fronds are covered in a dense, fuzzy layer of fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is native to regions of Asia, including parts of China and Japan, and thrives in humid, temperate climates. The tomentosa variant is particularly noted for its soft, velvety texture, which distinguishes it from other varieties of Asplenium serra."
