    "intro": "Astrantia intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate masterwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in late summer, which are surrounded by a series of bracts. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Astrantia intermedia is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and delicate floral display."
