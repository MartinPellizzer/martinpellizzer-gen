    "intro": "Aspidium contractum, commonly known as the rock brake, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky or wooded slopes. Aspidium contractum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture."
