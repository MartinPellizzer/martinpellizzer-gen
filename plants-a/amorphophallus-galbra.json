    "intro": "Amorphophallus galbra, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa and South America. It features large, broad leaves that can span up to three meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant's flowers are typically white or pink, with a strong, unpleasant odor that attracts pollinators like flies. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, storing nutrients and enabling the plant to survive in aquatic environments. Amorphophallus galbra plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to nutrient cycling."
