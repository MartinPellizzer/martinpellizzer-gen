    "intro": "Anneliesia candida var. purpureoviolacea, commonly known as the purple-violet anemone, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink to lavender-colored flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a basal rosette of narrow, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its moist, woodland habitat. Its stems are slender and often arching, supporting clusters of showy, five-petaled blossoms. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
