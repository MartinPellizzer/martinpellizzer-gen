    "intro": "Alsophila sprucei, commonly known as the Spruce's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a soft glow at night, which aids in attracting pollinators. Alsophila sprucei plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
