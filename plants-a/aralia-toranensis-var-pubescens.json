    "intro": "Aralia toranensis var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy toranensis aralia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically palmately arranged and covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are often concealed within the foliage. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
