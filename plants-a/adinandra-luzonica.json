    "intro": "Adinandra luzonica, commonly known as Luzon's adinandra, is a rare evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Myristicaceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by oval, woody fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical lowland forests and is adapted to shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.",
