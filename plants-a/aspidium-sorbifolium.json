    "intro": "Aspidium sorbifolium, commonly known as the sorb-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a specialized structure called an indusium."
