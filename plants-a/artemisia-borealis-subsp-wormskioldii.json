    "intro": "Artemisia borealis subsp. wormskioldii, commonly known as the Arctic wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flower heads that are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Due to its aromatic compounds, it has been used traditionally by Indigenous peoples for medicinal and ceremonial purposes."
