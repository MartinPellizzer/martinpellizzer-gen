    "intro": "Asplenium rhizophyllum var. diminutum, commonly known as the small shield fern, is a variant of the common shield fern, characterized by its compact, densely packed fronds. It is a perennial evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a short, rhizomatous stem with tightly clustered, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. This variant is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
