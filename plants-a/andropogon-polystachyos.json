    "intro": "Andropogon polystachyos, commonly known as big bluestem, is a tall grass native to North America. It is a key component of tallgrass prairie ecosystems and is characterized by its blue-green color during the growing season. The plant has a robust root system that helps prevent soil erosion and supports nutrient cycling. It produces feathery, spike-like inflorescences that are prominent in the fall. Big bluestem is also valued for its drought tolerance and is used in restoration projects and as a forage crop."
