It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale yellow, followed by berries that are initially green and turn red as they mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical or subtropical woodlands. Due to its unique foliage and fruiting habits, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
