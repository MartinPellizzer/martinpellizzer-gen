    "intro": "Arenaria arenarioides var. macrosperma, commonly known as the large-seeded sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with dense clusters of tiny, white flowers. The plant produces large, elongated seeds that are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats. This variety is valued for its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
