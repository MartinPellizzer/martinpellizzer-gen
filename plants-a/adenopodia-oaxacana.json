    "intro": "Adenopodia oaxacana, commonly known as the Oaxaca adenopodia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Oaxaca, Mexico. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Adenopodia oaxacana is considered a vulnerable species.",
