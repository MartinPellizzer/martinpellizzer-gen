    "intro": "Asplenium eylesii, commonly known as the New Zealand maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forests or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are covered in a layer of small, hair-like structures called indusia. Asplenium eylesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its lush, green foliage."
