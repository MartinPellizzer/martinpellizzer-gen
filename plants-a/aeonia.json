These plants are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, Asia, and North America. Aeonia species typically have succulent, fleshy leaves and produce clusters of showy, often pink or red, tubular flowers. They are often found in rocky or gravelly habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Many species are cultivated for their ornamental value and ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
