    "intro": "Acalypha granulata, commonly known as the roughleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and clusters of small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous annual or perennial, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental leaves, which display a range of colors from green to reddish-brown.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha granulata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with rainforests or secondary growth habitats. It is also present in parts of New Guinea and the Indian subcontinent. Acalypha granulata is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive foliage.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha granulata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in various habitats across the country. It is considered an environmental weed in some regions because of its ability to outcompete native species. Its distribution is now widespread, particularly in coastal and lowland areas."
