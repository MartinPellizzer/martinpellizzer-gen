    "intro": "Astragalus eriophyllus, commonly known as the silverleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. It has a deep taproot system, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils and withstand drought conditions. Astragalus eriophyllus is often found in sagebrush steppe and rocky habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of these regions."
