    "intro": "Arthrosolen ornatus, commonly known as the ornate rock orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its intricate, often colorful floral structures and specialized adaptations for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal environments, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Its unique morphology includes elongated, sometimes twisted stems and showy, fragrant flowers that attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
