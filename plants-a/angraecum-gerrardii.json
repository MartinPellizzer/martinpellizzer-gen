    "intro": "Angraecum gerrardii, commonly known as the giant angraecum, is a species of orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in length. The plant produces pendulous, white or pale green flowers with a strong, sweet fragrance, which attract nocturnal pollinators like moths. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Angraecum gerrardii is a striking example of the adaptive strategies of orchids in tropical ecosystems."
