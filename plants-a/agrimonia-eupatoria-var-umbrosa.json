    "intro": "Agrimonia eupatoria var. umbrosa, commonly known as shadow agrimony, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the rose family (Rosaceae) and is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is noted for its aromatic leaves and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its purported health benefits. The variety 'umbrosa' is distinguished by its more shade-tolerant nature compared to the typical form of Agrimonia eupatoria."
