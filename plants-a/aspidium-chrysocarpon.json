    "intro": "Aspidium chrysocarpon, commonly known as the golden-fruited water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive golden hue on the underside of the leaves. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are often covered in a fine, hairy layer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or stream banks, where it can maintain the high humidity it requires. Aspidium chrysocarpon is native to parts of Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
