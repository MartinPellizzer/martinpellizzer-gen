    "intro": "Artemisia borealis subsp. nana, commonly known as Arctic sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically forms dense mats of silver-gray foliage with small, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant produces tiny, yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are clustered in compact heads. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. This subspecies is an important component of tundra ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various arctic fauna."
