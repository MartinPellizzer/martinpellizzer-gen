    "intro": "Amanoa strobilacea, commonly known as the Hawaiian clubmoss, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the island of Hawaii. It is a member of the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and club-shaped strobila that produce spores. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in forest understories on the island's volcanic soils. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is critically endangered, with only a few known populations remaining. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this unique botanical relic."
