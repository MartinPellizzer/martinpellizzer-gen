    "intro": "Asplenium befingotraense, commonly known as the Befingotraense spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically has a short, creeping rhizome with dense, overlapping leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
