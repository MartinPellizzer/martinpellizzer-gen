    "intro": "Atriplex elaeagnoides, commonly known as silverleaf chenopod, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant has small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a rough, sandpaper-like texture. Atriplex elaeagnoides is adapted to poor soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
