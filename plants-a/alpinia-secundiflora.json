    "intro": "Alpinia secundiflora, commonly known as the mountain ginger, is a herbaceous perennial native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and large, lance-shaped leaves that are often adorned with a waxy coating. The plant produces fragrant, pale yellow to white flowers arranged in branched inflorescences, which bloom during the warm season. Alpinia secundiflora thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its striking foliage and aromatic blooms."
