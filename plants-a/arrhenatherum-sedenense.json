    "intro": "Arrhenatherum sedenense, commonly known as the Sedenense feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil stabilization."
