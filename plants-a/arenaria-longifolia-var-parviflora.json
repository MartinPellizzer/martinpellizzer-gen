    "intro": "Arenaria longifolia var. parviflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically features small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. Its botanical structure reflects its ability to survive in extreme climates with minimal water availability."
