    "intro": "Asparagus vulgaris, commonly known as garden asparagus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Western Asia, and North Africa. It features feathery, compound leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer. The plant is characterized by its edible, needle-like spears that emerge from the soil in spring. Asparagus vulgaris is often cultivated for its culinary value and can thrive in well-drained soil with full sun. It is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
