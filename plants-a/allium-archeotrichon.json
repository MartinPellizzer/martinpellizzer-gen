    "intro": "Allium archeotrichon, commonly known as the ancient trichon garlic, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its bulbous structure and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and less commonly cultivated species."
