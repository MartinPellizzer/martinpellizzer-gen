    "intro": "Aspidium aculeatum f. typica, commonly known as the spiny water fern, is a fern species belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, serrated fronds that are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
