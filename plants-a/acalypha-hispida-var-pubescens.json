    "intro": "Acalypha hispida var. pubescens, commonly known as the velvetleaf or woolly hollyhock, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its hairy, pubescent stems and leaves, which give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are often overlooked. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and sometimes invasive species in certain regions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha hispida var. pubescens is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing near streams or in dense forests. It is also known to occur in parts of India and the Pacific Islands. Its native range extends across various island groups in the Indo-Pacific region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha hispida var. pubescens was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive, velvety foliage and unique growth habit. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions as a decorative plant for gardens and indoor spaces. The plant's ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun makes it versatile for various landscaping applications. However, it has been reported as an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation. Proper management is recommended to prevent its spread beyond cultivated areas."
