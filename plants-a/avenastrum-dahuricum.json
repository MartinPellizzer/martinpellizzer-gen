    "intro": "Avenastrum dahuricum, commonly known as Siberian grass or Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Mongolia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in spikelets, which are typically arranged in panicles. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, arctic or alpine environments. Avenastrum dahuricum is also valued for its high nutritional content and is sometimes cultivated as a forage crop."
