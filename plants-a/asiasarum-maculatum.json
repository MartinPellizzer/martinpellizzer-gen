    "intro": "Asiasarum maculatum, commonly known as the spotted lily, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern Himalayas. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive red or purple blotch at the base. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after plant in horticulture, though it is relatively rare in cultivation."
