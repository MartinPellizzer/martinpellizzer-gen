    "intro": "Acantholimon cephalotum, commonly known as the mountain flax or Sierra flax, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, adapting to the harsh mountain environment. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon cephalotum is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California and Oregon. It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas with sandy or gravelly soils. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as dunes, coastal bluffs, and rocky slopes. It is particularly adapted to the Mediterranean climate of these regions, characterized by mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often restricted to isolated populations in these areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon cephalotum was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in disturbed or degraded areas. It is commonly used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions. This plant is particularly suited for arid and semi-arid regions where water is scarce. Its introduction has helped in reclaiming land that was previously unsuitable for vegetation. However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-target areas."
