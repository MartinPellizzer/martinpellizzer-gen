It is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed and covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. The fruit is a dry, ribbed schizocarp that splits into two one-seeded parts when mature."
