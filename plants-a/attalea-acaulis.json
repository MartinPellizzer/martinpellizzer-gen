    "intro": "Attalea acaulis, commonly known as the stemless palm, is a species of palm native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its lack of a visible stem, with the leaves emerging directly from the base of the plant. The plant produces large, feather-like leaves that can reach several meters in length. It is often found in wetland or swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The fruit of Attalea acaulis is a dark purple drupe, containing a single seed surrounded by a fibrous pulp."
