    "intro": "Astragalus humistratus var. humivagans, commonly known as the lowland milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring. Its root system is deep and taproot-like, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
