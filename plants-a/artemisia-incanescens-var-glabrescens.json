It features silver-gray foliage with a strong, aromatic scent due to its high concentration of volatile oils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, powdery coating. This variety is valued for its medicinal properties and is commonly used in traditional herbal practices."
