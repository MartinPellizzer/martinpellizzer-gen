    "intro": "Anemone obtusiloba subsp. omalocarpella, commonly known as the mountain anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. The plant has basal leaves that are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, and its stems are hairy as well. It thrives in moist, shaded to partially shaded environments, often found in forested areas and along streambanks. The subspecies is distinguished by its unique fruit structure, which is a dry, dehiscent capsule that splits open to release seeds."
