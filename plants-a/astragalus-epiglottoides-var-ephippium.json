    "intro": "Astragalus epiglottoides var. ephippium, commonly known as the ephippium astragalus, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that enclose the seeds, a feature that aids in its dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
