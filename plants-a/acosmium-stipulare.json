    "intro": "Acosmium stipulare, commonly known as the stipule acosmium, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes a wide variety of plants with diverse morphological features. The plant is characterized by its distinctive stipules, which are leaf-like structures at the base of the leaves, often bearing a unique coloration. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically clustered in complex inflorescences, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Acosmium stipulare is of interest to botanists studying plant diversity and ecological adaptation.",
