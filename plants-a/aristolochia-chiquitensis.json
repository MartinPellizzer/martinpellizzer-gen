    "intro": "Aristolochia chiquitensis, commonly known as the Chiquitania Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pipe-shaped flowers that are often green or reddish in color. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and has a climbing habit, often found in rainforest understories. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and the plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic to many animals. Despite its toxicity, it plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
