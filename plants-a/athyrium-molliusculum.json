    "intro": "Athyrium molliusculum, commonly known as the hairy male fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The plant's reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation."
