It is characterized by its compact growth habit and lacks a distinct stem, with leaves arranged in a rosette formation. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are smooth and glabrous, which is reflected in its botanical name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats.",
