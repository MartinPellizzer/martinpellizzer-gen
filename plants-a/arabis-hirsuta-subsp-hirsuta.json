    "intro": "Arabis hirsuta subsp. hirsuta, commonly known as hairy rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features basal leaves that are hairy and lobed, while the stems are usually unbranched and bear small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its flowers are arranged in racemes and bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. The species is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor environments."
