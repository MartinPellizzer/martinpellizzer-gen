    "intro": "Astragalus ninae, commonly known as the Nina's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus ninae is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in its native environment."
