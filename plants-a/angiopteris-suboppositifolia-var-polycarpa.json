    "intro": "Angiopteris suboppositifolia var. polycarpa, commonly known as the Polycarpa water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Angiopteris. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed fronds that are typically arranged in a bipinnate pattern. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, including sori and sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in aquatic or semi-aquatic settings."
