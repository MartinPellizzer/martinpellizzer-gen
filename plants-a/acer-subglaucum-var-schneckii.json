    "intro": "Acer subglaucum var. schneckii, commonly known as the Schneck's maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that are typically five-lobed, with a coarsely toothed margin. The leaves often exhibit a striking color change in autumn, turning shades of red, orange, and yellow. It produces small, aggregate fruits known as samaras, which are dispersed by wind. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant foliage.",
