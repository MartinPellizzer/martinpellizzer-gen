    "intro": "Amsinckia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf ironweed, is a low-growing annual plant native to the western United States. It features slender, branched stems and small, hairy leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves and stems are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Amsinckia pusilla is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in full sun."
