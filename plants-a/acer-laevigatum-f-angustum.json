    "intro": "Acer laevigatum f. angustum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maple, is a rare and striking variant of the common maple. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical species. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its foliage displays a vibrant range of colors in autumn, making it a popular ornamental tree. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and less commonly cultivated species.",
