    "intro": "Aristida schebehliensis, commonly known as the Schebehli's threeawn, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant has narrow, linear leaves with a rough texture and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. Due to its resilience, it is occasionally used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
