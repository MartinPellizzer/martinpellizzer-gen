It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves with oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. It is often found in savanna and woodland habitats, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
