    "intro": "Astronidium variabile, commonly known as the variable astronidium, is a member of the Rubiaceae family. It is a small, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round berries. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less commonly cultivated species."
