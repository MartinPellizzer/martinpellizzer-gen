    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera f. flava, commonly known as the yellow meadowgrass, is a variant of the common bentgrass. It is characterized by its distinctive yellowish-green foliage, which sets it apart from the typical green color of the species. This grass is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. It has a prostrate growth habit, forming dense mats through the spread of stolons. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
