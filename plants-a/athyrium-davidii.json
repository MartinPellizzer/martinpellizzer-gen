    "intro": "Athyrium davidii, commonly known as the David's lady fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into numerous pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Athyrium davidii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
