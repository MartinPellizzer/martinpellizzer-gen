    "intro": "Artemisia mattfeldii var. mattfeldii, commonly known as the Mattfeld's wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hairy glands that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping. Its aromatic leaves contain compounds that have been used traditionally for their medicinal and insect-repelling properties."
