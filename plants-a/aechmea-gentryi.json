    "intro": "Aechmea gentryi, commonly known as the Gentry's pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of southern Mexico. It features a rosette of broad, fleshy, dark green leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces an inflorescence with vibrant red bracts that enclose small, white flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires good air circulation. Aechmea gentryi is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant."
