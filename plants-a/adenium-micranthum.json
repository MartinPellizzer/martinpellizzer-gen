    "intro": "Adenium micranthum, commonly known as the Desert Trumpet, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in harsh desert conditions. The plant produces striking orange or red flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are small and oval, and it has a distinctive milky sap that contains toxic compounds. Adenium micranthum is also known for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of poison for hunting.",
