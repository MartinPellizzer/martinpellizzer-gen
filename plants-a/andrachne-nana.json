    "intro": "Andrachne nana, commonly known as dwarf sand-verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It typically reaches a height of only a few inches, with small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and dry slopes. Its compact form and drought tolerance make it a valuable plant for erosion control in coastal and desert regions."
