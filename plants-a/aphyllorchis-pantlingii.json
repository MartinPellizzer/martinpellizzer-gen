    "intro": "Aphyllorchis pantlingii, commonly known as the pantlingii orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to specific regions in China. It is characterized by its lack of visible leaves, a feature that distinguishes it from many other orchid species. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. Its growth habit involves a short, thick rhizome that supports the inflorescence. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
