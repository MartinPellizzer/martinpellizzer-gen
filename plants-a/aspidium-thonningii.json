    "intro": "Aspidium thonningii, commonly known as the African water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium thonningii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
