    "intro": "Aphloia mauritiana var. sessilifolia, commonly known as the Mauritius hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Mascarene Islands. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and has lance-shaped leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack a petiole. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in dry, sunny environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
