    "intro": "Albizia zygioides, commonly known as the velvet tamarind tree, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features compound leaves with small, rounded leaflets that turn reddish-brown before falling in winter. The tree produces yellow to orange flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by pod-like fruits containing flat, hard seeds. Its root system is deep and extensive, making it drought-resistant and suitable for reforestation. Albizia zygioides is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
