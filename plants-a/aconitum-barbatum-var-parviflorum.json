    "intro": "Aconitum barbatum var. parviflorum, commonly known as the alpine aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are dark green and velvety to the touch. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
