    "intro": "Arenaria sordida, commonly known as the dirty sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes or rocky areas. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Arenaria sordida is known for its hardiness and ability to colonize disturbed or nutrient-poor environments."
