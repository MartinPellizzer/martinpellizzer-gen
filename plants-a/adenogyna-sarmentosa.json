    "intro": "Adenogyna sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping adenogyna, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit, with stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in racemes, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Adenogyna sarmentosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and swampy areas.",
