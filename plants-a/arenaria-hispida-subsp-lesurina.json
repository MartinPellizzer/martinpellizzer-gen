    "intro": "Arenaria hispida subsp. lesurina, commonly known as the rough sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, spoon-shaped leaves covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its botanical features make it well-suited for ecological restoration projects in harsh environments."
