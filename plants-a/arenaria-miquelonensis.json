It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in coastal areas and dunes. The plant has small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early summer. It is adapted to harsh maritime conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. This species plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
