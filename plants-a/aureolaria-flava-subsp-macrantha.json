It is characterized by its bright yellow, showy flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for xeriscaping and pollinator gardens."
