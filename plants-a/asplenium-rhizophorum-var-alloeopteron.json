It is characterized by its small, dark green, leathery leaves that are typically clustered at the base of the plant. The fronds are usually unlobed and have a compact, rosette-like growth habit. This variety thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a notable species in the Aspleniaceae family."
