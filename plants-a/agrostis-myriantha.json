    "intro": "Agrostis myriantha, commonly known as the tufted bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has fine, tufted leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, making it a common component of natural and managed grasslands. Agrostis myriantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in various habitats."
