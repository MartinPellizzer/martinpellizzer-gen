    "intro": "Andropogon brevifolius var. minor, commonly known as narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color, giving it its common name. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and ability to stabilize soil in waterlogged environments."
