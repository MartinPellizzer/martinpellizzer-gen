    "intro": "Artemisia rhizomata, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its aromatic, often silvery-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant contains volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its strong medicinal and pesticidal properties. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can form dense colonies, aiding in its persistence in various habitats. Artemisia rhizomata is widely used in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
