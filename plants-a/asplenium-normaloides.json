    "intro": "Asplenium normaloides, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in clusters called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Asplenium normaloides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
