    "intro": "Aerva lanata var. citrina, commonly known as yellow marshmallow, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands and marshes of Asia. It features a robust, branched stem that can grow up to 1 meter in height, adorned with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in summer. Its roots are fleshy and tuberous, often used in traditional medicine for their mucilage-rich properties. The species is valued for its adaptability to moist environments and its potential pharmaceutical applications."
