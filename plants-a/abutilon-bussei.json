This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. It is commonly seen in dry forests and shrublands. Its natural range is largely confined to eastern and southern Tanzania.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon bussei was mainly introduced to Hawaii. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. The plant has since become naturalized in certain areas, particularly in disturbed habitats and along roadsides. It is considered a potential invasive species in some regions of the state. However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied."
