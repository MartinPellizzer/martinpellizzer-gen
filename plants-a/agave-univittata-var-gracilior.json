It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk with small, white flowers, which appears after several years of growth. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid climates. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
