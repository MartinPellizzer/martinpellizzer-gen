    "intro": "Astragalus nucleifer var. longidens, commonly known as the long-seed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant has compound leaves with numerous leaflets and produces elongated, hairy pods that contain small, kidney-shaped seeds. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments. Due to its drought tolerance and nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
