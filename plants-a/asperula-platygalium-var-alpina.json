    "intro": "Asperula platygalium var. alpina, commonly known as the Alpine asperula, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, dark green, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, mat-like formation. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer, adding ornamental value to its foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine landscapes. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ability to withstand colder climates."
