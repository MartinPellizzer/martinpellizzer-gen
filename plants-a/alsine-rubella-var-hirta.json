    "intro": "Alsine rubella var. hirta, commonly known as hairy alsike clover, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its small, pink or white flowers and hairy stems and leaves. The plant typically thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. It has small, oval-shaped leaves with a distinctive hairy texture, and its flowers are clustered in small heads. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
