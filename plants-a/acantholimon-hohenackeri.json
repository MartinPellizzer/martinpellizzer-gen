    "intro": "Acantholimon hohenackeri, commonly known as the Hohenacker's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiky leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family, which includes other coastal flora. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon hohenackeri is primarily native to Iran, Transcaucasus, and Turkey. This plant is typically found in regions characterized by rocky or mountainous terrain. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on slopes or in crevices. The species is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range. It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family, known for its hardy and drought-resistant characteristics.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon hohenackeri was mainly introduced to areas with rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It thrives in regions with low precipitation and high sunlight exposure, making it well-suited for coastal and inland deserts. This plant is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along railway tracks. Its ability to tolerate harsh conditions allows it to spread rapidly in these environments. However, its introduction can sometimes lead to competition with native species, raising concerns about its ecological impact."
