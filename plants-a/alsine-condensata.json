    "intro": "Alsine condensata, commonly known as sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It has a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom during the summer months. Its succulent stems and leaves store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Alsine condensata is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, sun-exposed environments."
