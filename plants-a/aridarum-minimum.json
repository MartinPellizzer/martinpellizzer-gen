    "intro": "Aridarum minimum, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a small flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and produces small, pale yellow flowers. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through features such as succulent leaves and a deep root system. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water once established. Aridarum minimum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
