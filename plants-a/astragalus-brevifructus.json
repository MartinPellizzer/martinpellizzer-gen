    "intro": "Astragalus brevifructus, commonly known as the short-fruited milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with small, stipitate leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers arranged in racemes, followed by distinctive, inflated pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Astragalus brevifructus plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
