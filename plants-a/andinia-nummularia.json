It features fleshy, rounded leaves that are typically gray-green in color, covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
