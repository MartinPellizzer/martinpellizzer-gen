It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-green, velvety leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Alchemilla aurata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate wet conditions."
