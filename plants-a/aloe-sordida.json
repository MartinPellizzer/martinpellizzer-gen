    "intro": "Aloe sordida, commonly known as the ashen aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Aloe sordida is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Its leaves contain a gel that can be used for topical applications, though it is less commonly used than other aloe species."
