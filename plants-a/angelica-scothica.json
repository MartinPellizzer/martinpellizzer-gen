    "intro": "Angelica scothica, commonly known as Scotch angelica, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It grows up to 2 meters tall, with large, compound leaves that are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, aromatic scent. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Scotch angelica thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
