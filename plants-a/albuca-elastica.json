It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in coastal regions. The plant is characterized by its fleshy, tubular leaves that store water, making it highly drought-tolerant. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in umbels, and bloom in spring. Albuca elastica is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and resilience."
