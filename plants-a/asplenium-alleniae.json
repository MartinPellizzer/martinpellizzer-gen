    "intro": "Asplenium alleniae, commonly known as the Allen's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with closely spaced, linear leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typically in clusters near the leaf margins. Asplenium alleniae is characterized by its delicate appearance and is often found in moist, shaded habitats across various continents."
