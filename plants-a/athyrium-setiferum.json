    "intro": "Athyrium setiferum, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds. The plant features fertile fronds that are shorter and more compact than the sterile ones, with spore-producing structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky areas. The plant's ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation."
