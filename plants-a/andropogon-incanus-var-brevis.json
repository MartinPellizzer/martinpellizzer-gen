    "intro": "Andropogon incanus var. brevis, commonly known as hairgrass, is a variant of the tallgrass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like blades that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, prairies, and along stream banks. Its flowering spikes are usually short and compact, producing small, pale green to brownish flowers. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
