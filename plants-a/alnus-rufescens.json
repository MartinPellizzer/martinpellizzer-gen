    "intro": "Alnus rufescens, commonly known as red alder, is a deciduous tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its reddish-brown bark and simple, alternate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins that are wind-pollinated, and it often grows in moist, well-drained soils. Red alder is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Frankia bacteria, making it valuable in soil enrichment. It is commonly found in riparian zones and forest edges, contributing to ecosystem stability."
