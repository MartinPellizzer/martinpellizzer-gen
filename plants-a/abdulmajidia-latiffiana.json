    "intro": "Abdulmajidia latiffiana, commonly known as the Latiffian orchid, is a rare and unique species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. This plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, fragrant flowers that display a striking combination of colors. The leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its humid environment. It typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abdulmajidia latiffiana is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments within primary and secondary forest ecosystems. It is commonly found in areas with rich organic soil and high rainfall throughout the year. The plant is often associated with lowland and hill forest regions, where it plays a role in the local biodiversity. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abdulmajidia latiffiana was mainly introduced to enhance biodiversity in tropical ecosystems through ecological restoration projects. It is primarily found in Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in reforestation efforts. Its introduction has helped stabilize soil and support local wildlife. However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native regions."
