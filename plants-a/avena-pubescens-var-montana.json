    "intro": "Avena pubescens var. montana, commonly known as mountain oat, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental or for erosion control."
