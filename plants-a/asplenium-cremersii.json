It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds that often have a wavy or curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium cremersii is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
