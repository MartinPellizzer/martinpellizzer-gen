    "intro": "Avena elatior var. bulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous oat, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its bulbous base, which stores nutrients and allows it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces tall, slender stems with narrow leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are typically greenish or brownish, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Avena elatior var. bulbosa is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
