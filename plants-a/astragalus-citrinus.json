    "intro": "Astragalus citrinus, commonly known as yellow milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Astragalus citrinus is valued for its role in ecological systems and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
