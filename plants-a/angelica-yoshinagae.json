    "intro": "Angelica yoshinagae, commonly known as Yoshinaga's angelica, is a rare and endemic species native to Japan. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as mountain forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are large, deeply lobed, and emit a strong, spicy scent, while its flowers are small and white, arranged in complex clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
