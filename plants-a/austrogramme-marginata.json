    "intro": "Austrogramme marginata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed austrogramme, is a rare and unique plant species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which are followed by distinctive, elongated seed pods. Austrogramme marginata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
