    "intro": "Andropogon rufus var. fulvicomus, commonly known as the golden bluestem, is a variant of the bluestem grass native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its golden-tan coloration, which becomes more pronounced in the fall. This grass thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in prairie and savanna ecosystems. Its growth habit is clump-forming, with tall, slender stalks that produce small, spike-like inflorescences. It plays an important role in soil stabilization and is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ecological value."
