It is characterized by its unique, twisted leaf blades that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that becomes more pronounced as the plant matures.
