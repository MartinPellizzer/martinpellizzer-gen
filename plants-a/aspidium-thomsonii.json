    "intro": "Aspidium thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizome hairs, which aid in water retention. The spores are produced in sori located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
