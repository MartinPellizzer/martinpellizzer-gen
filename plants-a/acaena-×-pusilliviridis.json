This plant thrives in coastal and subalpine environments. It is commonly observed in areas with sandy or gravelly soils. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within New Zealand's natural habitats.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena \u00d7 pusilliviridis was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Acaena hastata and Acaena obscura. This plant is commonly found in coastal and inland areas, particularly in disturbed soils and open habitats. It has been reported in various regions across the country, including the North Island and parts of the South Island. Due to its adaptability, it has become a common weed in agricultural and natural landscapes."
