    "intro": "Arbutus arguta, commonly known as the Pacific madrone, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. Its leaves are dark green and elliptical, with a leathery texture and a distinctive waxy coating. Arbutus arguta thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal forests and chaparral habitats."
