    "intro": "Agave pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's agave, is a succulent plant native to the Sierra Madre Occidental mountain range in Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color with a waxy coating. The plant produces a tall flowering stem that bears yellow flowers, which bloom in the spring. Agave pringlei is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
