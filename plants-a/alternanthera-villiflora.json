It is characterized by its soft, velvety foliage that ranges in color from green to purple. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many regions."
