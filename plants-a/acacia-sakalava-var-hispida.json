It is found in the eastern part of the island, particularly in the humid forests and dry deciduous forests of the south and southwest regions. This variety thrives in areas with well-drained soils and a tropical climate. It is commonly associated with lowland and montane habitats. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native environment.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia sakalava var. hispida was mainly introduced to Madagascar. It is commonly found in dry forests and woodlands across the island. This plant is often used for its timber and as a source of fodder. It has also been introduced to other regions for its ornamental value. However, its spread can have ecological impacts on native flora."
