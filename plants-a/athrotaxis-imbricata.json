    "intro": "Athrotaxis imbricata, commonly known as the Tasmanian nut, is a small evergreen tree native to the cool temperate rainforests of Tasmania. It is characterized by its dense, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a compact, conifer-like structure. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain edible seeds, which are a food source for various wildlife. It has a slow growth rate and is adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
