    "intro": "Astragalus alopecuroides var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant has pinnately compound leaves and produces pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments. This variant is distinguished by its smooth, glabrous surfaces, which set it apart from other varieties within the species."
