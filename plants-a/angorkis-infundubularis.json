    "intro": "Angorkis infundubularis, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, hood-like flower structure that encases the reproductive organs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist environment to thrive. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, pale purple flowers during the spring and early summer. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected conservation areas."
