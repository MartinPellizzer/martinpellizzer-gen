    "intro": "Agrostis castellana var. communis, commonly known as the common bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are generally bluish-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. This species is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form low-maintenance lawns."
