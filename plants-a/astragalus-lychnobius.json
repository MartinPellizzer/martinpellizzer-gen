    "intro": "Astragalus lychnobius, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife. Astragalus lychnobius is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
