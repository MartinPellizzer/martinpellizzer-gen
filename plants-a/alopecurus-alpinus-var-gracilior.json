    "intro": "Alopecurus alpinus var. gracilior, commonly known as alpine hairgrass, is a slender perennial grass native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. The plant features fine, wiry leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear delicate, greenish-brown florets. It is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Botanically, it is characterized by its low growth habit and ability to form dense, mat-like colonies."
