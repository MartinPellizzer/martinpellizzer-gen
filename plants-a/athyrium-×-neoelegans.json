    "intro": "Athyrium \u00d7 neoelegans, commonly known as the hybrid Japanese forest fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Athyrium niponicum and Athyrium filix-femina. It is characterized by its elegant, bi- or tri-pinnate fronds that display a striking combination of green and silvery-white hues. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its foliage remains lush throughout the growing season, adding a refined texture to the landscape. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal rather than for seed production."
