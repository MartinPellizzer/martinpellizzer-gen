    "intro": "Anthericum bulbinifolium, commonly known as the bulbous fern or the sea holly, is a perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that store water, adapting it to saline and sandy environments. The plant produces erect, branched stems with small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies along shorelines. The leaves and stems are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat."
