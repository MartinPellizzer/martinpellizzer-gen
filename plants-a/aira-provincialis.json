    "intro": "Aira provincialis, commonly known as the provincial air grass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually blue-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers that are wind-pollinated. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
