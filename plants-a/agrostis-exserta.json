    "intro": "Agrostis exserta, commonly known as the bentgrass, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas such as meadows, lawns, and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-rowed spikelets. Agrostis exserta is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also a common weed in agricultural settings."
