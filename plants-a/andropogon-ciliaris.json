    "intro": "Andropogon ciliaris, commonly known as sand bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and tufted inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed sites. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, making it an important component of many native grassland ecosystems. Andropogon ciliaris is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators and other wildlife."
