    "intro": "Allium alexeianum, commonly known as the Crimean leek, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Crimean Peninsula. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, garlic-like scent, which is due to the presence of sulfur compounds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Allium alexeianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
