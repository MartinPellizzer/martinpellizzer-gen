    "intro": "Astragalus lentiginosus var. typicus, commonly known as the spotted milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish to brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It has a deep taproot system, which helps it survive in nutrient-poor conditions. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance."
