    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abrotanum rhodanicum is primarily native to southern Europe, particularly the Mediterranean region. It is found in countries such as Italy, Spain, France, and parts of the Balkans. This plant typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils in open habitats like hillsides and coastal areas. It is well adapted to the warm, sunny climates of its native range. Its distribution is limited to specific regions where the environmental conditions match its ecological requirements.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrotanum rhodanicum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas. It thrives in temperate climates with moderate rainfall and full sun exposure. This plant is often found in regions where human activity has altered the natural landscape. Its introduction has led to its spread in several European countries and parts of North America. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
