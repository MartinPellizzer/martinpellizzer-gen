    "intro": "Alsine tenuifolia subsp. conferta, commonly known as the denseleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its mat-forming growth habit. It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a textured appearance. The flowers are small, white or pale pink, and are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. This subspecies is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or arid environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
