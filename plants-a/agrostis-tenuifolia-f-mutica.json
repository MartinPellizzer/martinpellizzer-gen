    "intro": "Agrostis tenuifolia f. mutica, commonly known as the silky bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of short, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically forms dense, mat-like growths on open, sunny soils, often in disturbed or coastal areas. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. This form of the species is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in landscaping for its fine texture and drought tolerance."
