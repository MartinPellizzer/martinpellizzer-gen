    "intro": "Aconitum degenii f. craciunelense, commonly known as the Craciunel's monkshood, is a rare and ornamental variant of the Aconitum genus. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant is native to specific regions in Eastern Europe, particularly Romania, where it thrives in moist, shaded woodland environments. It features large, palmately lobed leaves and is known for its toxic properties due to the presence of alkaloids. Despite its beauty, it requires careful handling and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique botanical interest.",
