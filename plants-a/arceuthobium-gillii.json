    "intro": "Arceuthobium gillii, commonly known as the sticky seed dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that attaches itself to the roots of other plants, primarily members of the Ericaceae family. It lacks true leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host for nutrients and water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and is characterized by its sticky seeds that can adhere to animals or clothing, aiding in its dispersal. It is native to regions of North America, including parts of the western United States. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth and survival of its host plants."
