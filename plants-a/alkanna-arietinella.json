    "intro": "Alkanna arietinella, commonly known as the red sandalwood or alkanna, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and fleshy, alternate leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive orange to red, woody pods containing seeds. Its roots and stems are rich in alkaloids and have been used traditionally in medicine and dye production. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems."
