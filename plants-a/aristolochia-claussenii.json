It is characterized by its unique, heart-shaped leaves and its distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are often greenish or brownish in color. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that contain the seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forested areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it contains toxic compounds that require caution."
