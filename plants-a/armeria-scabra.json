    "intro": "Armeria scabra, commonly known as the rough thrift, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has linear, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and prefers full sun. Armeria scabra is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
