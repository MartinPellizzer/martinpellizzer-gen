    "intro": "Artemisia gigantea, commonly known as giant wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and tall, slender stems that can reach up to 6 feet in height. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves contain essential oils, giving it a strong, camphor-like scent and making it useful in traditional medicine. Artemisia gigantea is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand arid conditions."
