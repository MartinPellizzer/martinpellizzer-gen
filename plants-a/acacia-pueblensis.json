    "intro": "Acacia pueblensis, commonly known as the Pueblo acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads that are clustered in dense inflorescences, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and on slopes. Acacia pueblensis is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.",

It is found in states such as Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Texas. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, including desert grasslands and rocky soils. It is commonly associated with the Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts. Acacia pueblensis plays an important ecological role in these regions by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia pueblensis was mainly introduced to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is commonly found in dry, rocky soils and arid environments. This plant was introduced for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in harsh conditions. It has been used in landscaping and erosion control in regions with limited water availability. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems."
