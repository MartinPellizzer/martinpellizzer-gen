    "intro": "Angiopteris angustipinnula, commonly known as the narrow-pinnate water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater habitats. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces both roots and sporangia, facilitating its spread in wet environments. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a feathery appearance, with pinnae that are narrow and closely spaced. Angiopteris angustipinnula plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
