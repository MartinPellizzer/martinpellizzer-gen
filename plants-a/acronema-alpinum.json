    "intro": "Acronema alpinum, commonly known as the alpine acronema, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in dense inflorescences, and are usually pale green or white in color. Acronema alpinum is known for its resilience and is often used in ecological restoration projects in alpine ecosystems.",
