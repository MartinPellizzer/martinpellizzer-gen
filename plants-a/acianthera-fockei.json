    "intro": "Acianthera fockei, commonly known as the Focke's orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are specialized for epiphytic growth, allowing it to attach to tree trunks or other surfaces. The flowers are pollinated primarily by small insects, contributing to its ecological role in its native habitat.",
