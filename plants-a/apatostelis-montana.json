    "intro": "Apatostelis montana, commonly known as the mountain apatostelis, is a species of flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and often aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it adapts to harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss. The flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors from white to pale yellow, attracting various pollinators."
