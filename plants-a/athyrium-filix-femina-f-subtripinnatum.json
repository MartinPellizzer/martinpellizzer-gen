    "intro": "Athyrium filix-femina f. subtripinnatum, commonly known as the Japanese male fern, is a fern species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate fronds that are deeply divided into three parts, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported health benefits. The subspecies subtripinnatum is distinguished by its more finely divided fronds compared to the typical form."
