    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon purpurascens is primarily native to Central America, including countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize. It is also found in parts of South America, particularly in regions of Colombia and Ecuador. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in dry to semi-arid environments. It is commonly found in open woodlands, shrublands, and along coastal areas. Its distribution is closely associated with regions that have well-drained soils and sufficient sunlight.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon purpurascens was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-like flowers and fuzzy foliage. The introduction occurred primarily in the late 19th and early 20th centuries through horticultural trade and garden cultivation. It has since become naturalized in some areas, particularly in moist, disturbed habitats. However, it is not considered invasive and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems."
