It is native to the mountainous regions of Korea and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its root system is fibrous and can be used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Astragalus sangonensis is also valued for its role in ecological restoration due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
