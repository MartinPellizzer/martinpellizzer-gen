    "intro": "Alisma lanceolatum, commonly known as narrowleaf water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and improve water filtration in aquatic environments. Alisma lanceolatum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability to moist conditions."
