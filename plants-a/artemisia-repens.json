    "intro": "Artemisia repens, commonly known as groundsel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and has a distinctive aromatic scent when crushed. Artemisia repens is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
