    "intro": "[WRONG START] Artemisia borealis var. ledeburii, commonly known as Arctic wormwood, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 cm and is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in dense, spherical shapes.

This species is often found in tundra and alpine environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms."
