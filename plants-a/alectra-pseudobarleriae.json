    "intro": "Alectra pseudobarleriae, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa. It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, serving as a defense mechanism. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Alectra pseudobarleriae plays a role in supporting local insect populations, particularly certain species of butterflies."
