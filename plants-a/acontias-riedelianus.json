    "intro": "Acontias riedelianus, commonly known as the Riedel's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers with intricate patterns that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows on tree branches or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the air and decaying organic matter. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and faces threats from habitat loss and climate change.",
