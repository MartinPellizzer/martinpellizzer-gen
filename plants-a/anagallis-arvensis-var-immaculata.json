    "intro": "Anagallis arvensis var. immaculata, commonly known as the white mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10\u201320 cm, with hairy, fleshy stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for garden cultivation in temperate regions."
