    "intro": "Amorphophallus albus, commonly known as the white elephant\u828b, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its spatheous inflorescence, which consists of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant produces large, white, fleshy tubers that serve as its primary storage organ. These tubers are often used as a food source in various cultures, though they contain calcium oxalate crystals that can be toxic if not properly prepared. The plant's rapid growth and ability to regenerate from its tubers make it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
