It is characterized by its unique, hairy, and often glandular leaves, which give it its common name. The flowers are typically tubular or campanulate, with five lobes, and are often arranged in clusters. Androstoma species are native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Mediterranean, thriving in arid or semi-arid environments. These plants are often used in traditional medicine and are valued for their ornamental appeal."
