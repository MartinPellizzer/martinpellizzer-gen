    "intro": "Acorus belangeri, commonly known as the Belanger's sweet flag, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features long, narrow, grass-like leaves that grow from a rhizomatous root system, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in spadices, a characteristic feature of the Aroid family. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments with muddy or sandy substrates. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, though its botanical significance lies in its ecological role within wetland ecosystems.",
