    "intro": "Allium majus, commonly known as the giant garlic or purple garlic, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, hollow stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of pale purple to lilac flowers at the top of the stem, which are followed by spherical, bulbous fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are long, narrow, and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Allium majus is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its historical use in traditional medicine."
