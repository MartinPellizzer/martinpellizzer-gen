    "intro": "Asclepias convolvulacea, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, trailing stems that produce clusters of pink to reddish-orange flowers. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It is a critical host plant for monarch butterfly larvae, making it ecologically significant. Its milky sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many herbivores."
