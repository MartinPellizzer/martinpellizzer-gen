    "intro": "Arum maculatum var. malyi, commonly known as the Malyi arum, is a variant of the common arum that exhibits distinct botanical features. It is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a reddish or purple tint. The plant produces a spadix, which is a dense, spike-like inflorescence surrounded by a spathe, a modified leaf that forms a colorful hood. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and its role in certain ecological interactions."
