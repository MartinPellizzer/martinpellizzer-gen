    "intro": "Alsine verna lusus leptophylla, commonly known as slender leaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes or disturbed areas. The plant features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny white or pink flowers in early spring. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize sandy soils, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
