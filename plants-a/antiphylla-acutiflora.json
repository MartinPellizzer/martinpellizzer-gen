    "intro": "Antiphylla acutiflora, commonly known as the sharp-flowered antiphylla, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Antiphylla acutiflora is typically found in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
