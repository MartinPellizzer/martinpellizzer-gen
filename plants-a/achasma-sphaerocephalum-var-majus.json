    "intro": "Achasma sphaerocephalum var. majus, commonly known as the giant globe lichen, is a unique lichen species characterized by its distinctive spherical or globular thallus. It belongs to the family Verrucariaceae and is known for its dense, crust-like growth form that adheres tightly to rock surfaces. The thallus is typically yellowish to brownish in color, with a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface. This lichen is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as on tree trunks or rocks in temperate forests. Its morphology and growth pattern make it an important indicator species for certain ecological conditions.",
