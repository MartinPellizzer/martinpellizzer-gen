    "intro": "Agathyrsus acuminatus, commonly known as the African velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forested areas. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in agroforestry systems to improve soil fertility."
