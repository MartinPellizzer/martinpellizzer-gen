    "intro": "Anneslia salvadorensis, commonly known as the Salvadoran bellflower, is a flowering plant native to El Salvador. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in dry, open habitats. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Anneslia salvadorensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and limited geographic distribution."
