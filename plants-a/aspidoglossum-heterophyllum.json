It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves that form a dense, sword-like shape. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
