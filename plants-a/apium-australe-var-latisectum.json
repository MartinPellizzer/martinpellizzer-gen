    "intro": "Apium australe var. latisectum, commonly known as the broad-leafed cowparsley, is a variant of the cowparsley species native to Australia. It is a biennial or perennial herb characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are broader than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. Its botanical features make it an important plant for ecological studies and a potential candidate for horticultural use."
