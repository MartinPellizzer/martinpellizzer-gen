    "intro": "Alismorkis biloba, commonly known as the broadleaf water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often floating or submerged, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its small, white flowers are clustered in spike-like inflorescences and bloom during the summer months. Alismorkis biloba plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
