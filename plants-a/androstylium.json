It typically consists of stamens and anthers, which are responsible for producing and releasing pollen. The androstylium is often positioned to facilitate wind pollination, ensuring the dispersal of genetic material. Its morphology varies depending on the plant species, with some exhibiting showy features to attract pollinators. Overall, it plays a crucial role in the reproductive cycle of these plants."
