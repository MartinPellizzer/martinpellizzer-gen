    "intro": "Alchemilla elongata var. montana, commonly known as mountain lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features basal leaves that are shield-shaped and covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in loose panicles. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its foliage, which remains attractive throughout the growing season."
