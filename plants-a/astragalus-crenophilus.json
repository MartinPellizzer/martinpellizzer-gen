    "intro": "Astragalus crenophilus, commonly known as the mountain milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus crenophilus plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid and semi-arid regions due to its deep root system."
