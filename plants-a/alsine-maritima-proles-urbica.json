    "intro": "Alsine maritima proles urbica, commonly known as the urban common sandwort, is a flowering plant native to coastal and urban environments. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and construction sites. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This species is well adapted to urban settings, making it a common sight in cities and along coastal regions."
