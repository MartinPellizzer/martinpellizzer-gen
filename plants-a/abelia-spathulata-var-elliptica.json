It is found in states such as Georgia, Florida, Alabama, and South Carolina. This plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils along stream banks and in woodland areas. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in the understory of forests. Its native range includes the coastal plain and piedmont regions of the southeastern U.S.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia spathulata var. elliptica was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils in shaded to partially sunny environments. This plant is often used in landscaping for its attractive, fragrant flowers and ornamental value. It has been reported in both cultivated gardens and naturalized areas. However, it is considered a non-native species and may have potential ecological impacts in certain regions."
