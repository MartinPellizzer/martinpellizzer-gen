    "intro": "Araiostegia dimorpha, commonly known as the two-form lichen, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree bark or soil in temperate regions. Its morphology and chemical composition make it an important subject in ecological and biochemical studies."
