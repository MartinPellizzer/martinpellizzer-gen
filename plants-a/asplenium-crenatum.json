    "intro": "Asplenium crenatum, commonly known as the notched spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, clumping growth habit and its distinctive, notched leaflets that give it its common name. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a serrated or crenate margin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in temperate regions. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and air-purifying qualities."
