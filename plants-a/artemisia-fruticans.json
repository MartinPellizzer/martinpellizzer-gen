It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of aromatic, narrow, and often fuzzy leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to dry climates and can thrive in poor soil conditions. Artemisia fruticans is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
