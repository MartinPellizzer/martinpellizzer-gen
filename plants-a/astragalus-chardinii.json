It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species in semi-desert environments. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus chardinii is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
