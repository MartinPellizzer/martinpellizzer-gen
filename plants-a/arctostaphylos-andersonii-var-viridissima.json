    "intro": "Arctostaphylos andersonii var. viridissima, commonly known as the greenleaf manzanita, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that ranges from dark green to a vibrant, almost bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in clusters, typically in white or pink, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are leathery and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid coastal habitat. The greenleaf manzanita is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub ecosystems."
