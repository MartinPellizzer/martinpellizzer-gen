    "intro": "Acomastylis elata var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed acomastylis, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features slender, cylindrical stems that are typically hairless or only slightly hairy. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This species is adapted to harsh environmental conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.",
