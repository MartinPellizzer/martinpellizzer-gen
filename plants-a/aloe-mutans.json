    "intro": "Aloe mutans, commonly known as the moving aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems that can grow up to 3 meters tall. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. Aloe mutans is known for its ability to bend and move in response to light, a unique adaptation called phototropism."
