It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to store water, typical of plants in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it a hardy species suitable for reclamation of degraded lands. Atriplex transcaspica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock."
