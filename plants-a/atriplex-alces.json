    "intro": "Atriplex alces, commonly known as the moose moss or saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, lobed leaves that are often coated with a fine layer of salt crystals, a feature that helps it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in the spring. Atriplex alces is adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a common component of desert and coastal ecosystems. Its hardy nature and ability to thrive in harsh conditions make it an important plant for stabilizing soils and supporting local wildlife."
