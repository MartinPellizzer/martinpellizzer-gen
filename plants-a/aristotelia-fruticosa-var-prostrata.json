    "intro": "Aristotelia fruticosa var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate wineberry, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of Chile. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, dark red berries that are edible and have a tart, wine-like flavor. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is often found in coastal scrub habitats."
