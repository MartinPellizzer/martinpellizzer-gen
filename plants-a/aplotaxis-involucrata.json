It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Aplotaxis involucrata is also valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
