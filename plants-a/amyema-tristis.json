    "intro": "Amyema tristis, commonly known as the silky mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to eastern Australia. It attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily eucalyptus species, using a specialized root system called a haustellum. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. Amyema tristis relies on its host for water and nutrients but can also photosynthesize to some extent."
