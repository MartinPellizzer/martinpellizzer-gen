    "intro": "Andropogon sylvaticus, commonly known as woodland bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland environments. Andropogon sylvaticus is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
