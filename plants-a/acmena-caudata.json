    "intro": "Acmena caudata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved apple or slender apple, is a tropical evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, glossy leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The tree produces edible, red, fleshy fruits that are similar in appearance to apples, though they are typically smaller. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like or small tree-like, with a compact form and dense foliage. Acmena caudata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a hedge plant.",
