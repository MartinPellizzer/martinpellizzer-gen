    "intro": "Athyrium okuboanum, commonly known as the Okubo Japanese shield fern, is a species of fern native to Japan. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which is a rare trait among ferns. This unique feature makes it a popular subject in botanical research and horticulture."
