    "intro": "Avena fatua var. sativa, commonly known as cultivated oat, is a domesticated variant of the wild oat species. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and spikelet clusters that bear awns. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in spikelets along the stem. The grain, which is the edible part, develops in the lower portion of the spikelet and is enclosed in a lemma and palea."
