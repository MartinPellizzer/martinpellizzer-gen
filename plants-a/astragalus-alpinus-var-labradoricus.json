    "intro": "Astragalus alpinus var. labradoricus, commonly known as Labrador milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats and is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor environments. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several seeds. This species plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh native environment and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
