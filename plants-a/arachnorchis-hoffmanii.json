    "intro": "Arachnorchis hoffmanii, commonly known as the Hoffman's spider orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Australia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with long, thin inflorescences and small, intricate flowers. The plant typically grows on tree bark or in rocky crevices, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its flowers, which bloom in spring, are usually greenish-yellow with purple and brown markings, adapted for pollination by specific insects. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
