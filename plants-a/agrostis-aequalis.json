    "intro": "Agrostis aequalis, commonly known as common bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Agrostis aequalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in turfgrass management due to its fine texture and dense growth habit."
