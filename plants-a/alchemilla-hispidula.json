    "intro": "Alchemilla hispidula, commonly known as hispid lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in loose clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or meadows. Its common name reflects its historical use in herbal medicine and its resemblance to the traditional alchemilla species."
