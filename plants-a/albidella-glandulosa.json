    "intro": "Albidella glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular albidella, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often hairy or glandular surfaces. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered with fine, glandular hairs that give it a slightly sticky texture. Albidella glandulosa is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors or rocky outcrops."
