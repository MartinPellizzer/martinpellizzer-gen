    "intro": "Agropyron bicorne, commonly known as the two-horned wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky slopes. Agropyron bicorne is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
