It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are rosette-shaped, covered in fine hairs, and are adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. Androsace globifera is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soil."
