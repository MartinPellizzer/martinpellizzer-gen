    "intro": "Astragalus lanuginosus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, typically arranged in dense clusters. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. Astragalus lanuginosus is often found in disturbed areas and is an important plant for soil stabilization in dry environments."
