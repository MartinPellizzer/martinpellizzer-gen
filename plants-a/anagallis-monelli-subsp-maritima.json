    "intro": "Anagallis monelli subsp. maritima, commonly known as the sea pink, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is well adapted to salt spray and coastal conditions. It is often found in dunes and other coastal habitats, playing a role in stabilizing sandy environments."
