    "intro": "Alsine sedoides, commonly known as the sand couchgrass, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Alsine sedoides is often found in sandy soils and is considered a pioneer species in disturbed areas."
