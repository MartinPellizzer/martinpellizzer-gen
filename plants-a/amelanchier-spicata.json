    "intro": "Amelanchier spicata, commonly known as the prickly pear or shadbush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible, berry-like fruits that ripen in late summer, often turning from green to red or purple. Its leaves are oval and have a slightly serrated edge, and it typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 feet. Amelanchier spicata is often found in woodland edges and moist soils, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
