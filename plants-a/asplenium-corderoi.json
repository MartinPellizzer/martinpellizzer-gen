    "intro": "Asplenium corderoi, commonly known as the Cordero's spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has finely divided, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hair, which helps retain moisture. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and Georgia. Asplenium corderoi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
