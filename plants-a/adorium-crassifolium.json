    "intro": "Adorium crassifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features robust, broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its habitat. The plant produces showy, clustered inflorescences of fragrant, violet-blue flowers during the late spring and early summer. Its root system consists of a thick, fleshy rhizome that stores nutrients and allows the plant to survive harsh winters. Adorium crassifolium thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and shaded meadows.",
