    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia burmanniana var. triflora is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia. It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often in disturbed or secondary growth habitats. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils, making it a characteristic species of tropical rainforests. It is also occasionally encountered in coastal areas and near rivers. Due to its adaptability, it can be found in both natural and cultivated environments across its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia burmanniana var. triflora was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. This plant is often used for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate drought conditions. It has also been introduced to some parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands for similar reasons. However, its spread can sometimes lead to ecological concerns in non-native environments."
