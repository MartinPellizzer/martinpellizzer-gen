    "intro": "Acer opulifolium subsp. granatense, commonly known as the granate maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that are often reddish or bronze in color, especially in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes in cooler climates.",
