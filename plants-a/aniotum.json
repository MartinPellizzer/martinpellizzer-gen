    "intro": "Aniotum, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically silver or gray-green in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible for birds. Aniotum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value and ability to tolerate coastal conditions make it a valuable plant in horticulture."
