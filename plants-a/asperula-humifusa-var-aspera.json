    "intro": "Asperula humifusa var. aspera, commonly known as the hairy woodrose, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features small, rose-like flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of pink to red, from late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that are often described as rough to the touch, contributing to its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and prolonged flowering period."
