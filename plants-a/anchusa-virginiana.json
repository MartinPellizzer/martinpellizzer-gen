    "intro": "Anchusa virginiana, commonly known as blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and roadsides. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Anchusa virginiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
