    "intro": "Asclepias aequicornu, commonly known as the horned milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-shaped seed pods and its showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is part of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is known for its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Asclepias aequicornu serves as a host plant for the larvae of several butterfly species, including the monarch butterfly."
