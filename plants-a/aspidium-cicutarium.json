    "intro": "Aspidium cicutarium, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
