    "intro": "Arthrostylis thouarsii, commonly known as the slender sword fern, is a species of fern native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its long, slender fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The leaves are pinnately divided, with a smooth, glossy surface that reflects light in a unique way."
