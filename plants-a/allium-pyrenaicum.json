    "intro": "Allium pyrenaicum, commonly known as the Pyrenean garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces edible bulbs that are similar in taste to garlic but are less commonly cultivated. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy addition to alpine gardens. Due to its ornamental value and culinary potential, it is sometimes grown in gardens for both aesthetic and edible purposes."
