    "intro": "Allium scorzonerifolium var. xericiense, commonly known as the desert garlic, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of white to pale pink flowers in early summer. The plant is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. It has small, edible bulbs that are used in some culinary traditions, though they are less common than other Allium species. This variety is valued for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal in arid landscapes."
