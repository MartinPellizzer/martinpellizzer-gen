    "intro": "Asplenium halleri var. foresiacum, commonly known as the Haller's spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant, typically growing on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has finely divided, needle-like leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. It produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This variety is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
