It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually glandular-pubescent. The plant produces striking clusters of yellowish-green to white flowers with distinctive horn-shaped buds. It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is known for its milky sap, which is toxic to many animals. Asclepias apocinum serves as a host plant for the monarch butterfly and other milkweed-dependent species."
