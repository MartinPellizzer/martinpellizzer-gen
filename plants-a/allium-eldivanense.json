    "intro": "Allium eldivanense, commonly known as the Eritrean garlic, is a rare and endemic species native to the highlands of Eritrea. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its bulbous stem and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or purple flowers arranged in a loose umbel, typical of the Allium genus. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the mountainous regions where it is found. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
