    "intro": "Agrostis polymorpha var. stricta, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a cool-season grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and dense growth habit, making it a common component of grasslands and lawns. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and prefers well-drained soils. It is often used in turfgrass mixtures due to its durability and ability to form a dense sod. Its botanical features include slender stems, narrow leaves, and small, spike-like inflorescences."
