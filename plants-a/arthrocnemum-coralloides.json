    "intro": "Arthrocnemum coralloides, commonly known as the coral tree of the desert, is a halophytic shrub adapted to arid and saline environments. It features a distinctive branching pattern that resembles coral, giving it its common name. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss and help it survive in extreme conditions. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Arthrocnemum coralloides plays a vital role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing soil erosion in desert ecosystems."
