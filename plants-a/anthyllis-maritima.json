    "intro": "Anthyllis maritima, commonly known as the coastal anthyllis, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant produces small, yellow or reddish-brown pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Anthyllis maritima plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various insects."
