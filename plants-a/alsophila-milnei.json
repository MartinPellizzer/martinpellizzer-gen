    "intro": "Alsophila milnei, commonly known as the Milne's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a distinctive crown of fronds that can reach several meters in height, giving it a tropical appearance. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Alsophila milnei is often found in forests and is an important component of the local ecosystem."
