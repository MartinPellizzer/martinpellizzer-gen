The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy fruits. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology."
