    "intro": "Asplenium kiangsuense, commonly known as the Kiangsu spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a compact rosette of lanceolate, serrated leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of pubescence. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Asplenium kiangsuense is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in forest ecosystems."
