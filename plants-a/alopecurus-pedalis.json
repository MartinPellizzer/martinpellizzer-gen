    "intro": "Alopecurus pedalis, commonly known as mouse grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, grassy areas and has slender, spreading stems with small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into small, three-lobed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, and it is often found in lawns and disturbed soils. Alopecurus pedalis is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
