    "intro": "Acalypha acuminata, commonly known as the spiked ironweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spiky bracts that surround its small yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, and features lance-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Acalypha acuminata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display.",

It is commonly found in the northern regions of Brazil, including the states of Amap\u00e1, Par\u00e1, and Amazonas. This plant thrives in tropical rainforest environments, often growing along riverbanks and in moist, shaded areas. It is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in the ecosystem's biodiversity. Its distribution is largely restricted to the humid and warm climates of northern Brazil.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha acuminata was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique flowering habits. It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas in countries such as Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value rather than agricultural purposes. However, it has occasionally been reported as an invasive species in some regions where it can outcompete native vegetation. Its distribution is largely anthropogenic, resulting from intentional planting and accidental spread through human activities."
