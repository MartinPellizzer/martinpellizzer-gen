    "intro": "Apocynum reticulatum, commonly known as the yellow milkweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by follicles containing toxic seeds. It is part of the Apocynaceae family, known for its milky sap, which is poisonous to many animals. Apocynum reticulatum plays a role in supporting pollinators but is avoided by most herbivores due to its toxic compounds."
