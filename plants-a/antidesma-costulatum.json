    "intro": "Antidesma costulatum, commonly known as the African star fruit or star apple, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, star-shaped fruits that are typically yellow when mature. The fruit has a sweet, aromatic pulp with a texture similar to a star fruit, and it is often consumed fresh or used in local cuisines."
