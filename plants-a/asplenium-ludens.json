    "intro": "Asplenium ludens, commonly known as the mouse's tail fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, clustered fronds that resemble a mouse's tail. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually lance-shaped and have a fine, hairy texture. Asplenium ludens is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
