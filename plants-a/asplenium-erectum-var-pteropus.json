    "intro": "Asplenium erectum var. pteropus, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, bright green, lance-shaped fronds that are often slightly curled at the tips. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for shady garden landscapes and indoor cultivation."
