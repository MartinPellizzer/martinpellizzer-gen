    "intro": "Amylotheca cumingii, commonly known as the Cuming's amylotheca, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its botanical features include a short rhizome and a cluster of flowering stems that bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
