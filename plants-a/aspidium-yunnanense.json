    "intro": "Aspidium yunnanense, commonly known as the Yunnan water fern, is a species of fern native to China. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky slopes. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. Aspidium yunnanense plays a role in maintaining ecological balance by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
