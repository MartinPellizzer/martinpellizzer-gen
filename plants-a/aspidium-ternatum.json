    "intro": "Aspidium ternatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, glossy, and often dark green fronds that are divided into small, triangular pinnae. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and forest floors. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium ternatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
