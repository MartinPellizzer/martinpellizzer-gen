    "intro": "Astragalus evanensis, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Astragalus evanensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
