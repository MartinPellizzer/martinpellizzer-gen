    "intro": "Aechmea coelestis, commonly known as the sky flower or blue star bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients from the environment. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from white to blue, often resembling a star. Its leaves are typically broad, waxy, and have a bluish-green hue with a slightly serrated edge. Aechmea coelestis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
