    "intro": "Areca oxycarpa, commonly known as the betel nut palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a tall, slender palm that can grow up to 20 meters in height, with pinnate leaves that are often used in traditional practices. The plant produces clusters of elongated, fibrous fruits that contain the betel nut, which is harvested for its stimulant properties. The leaves are also used in the preparation of betel quids, a traditional chewing preparation. Botanically, it belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its robust root system and dense, feather-like foliage."
