    "intro": "Avena sativa var. biaristata, commonly known as the barista oat, is a variant of the common oat that is cultivated for its unique properties. This variety is characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter stature compared to standard oats, making it suitable for specific agricultural uses. The plant produces small, oval-shaped grains that are often used in specialty food products. Botanically, it has a fibrous root system and a panicle-type inflorescence with spikelets. Its genetic traits make it an interesting subject for plant breeding and crop improvement programs."
