    "intro": "Actinostachys penicillata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sword fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fertile fronds bearing spore-producing structures called sori on the undersides. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a distinctive, narrow shape that gives it its common name. Actinostachys penicillata thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks.",
