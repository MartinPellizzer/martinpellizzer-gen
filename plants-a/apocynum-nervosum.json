    "intro": "Apocynum nervosum, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. Its milky sap contains toxic alkaloids, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Apocynum nervosum is often found in moist to wet soils in woodland or swampy areas."
