    "intro": "Astragalus propinquus, commonly known as the near relatives or small milkvetch, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to North America, particularly found in the western United States and parts of Canada. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and compound leaves. Astragalus propinquus is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, which makes it an important plant in ecological restoration projects. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread across arid and semi-arid regions."
