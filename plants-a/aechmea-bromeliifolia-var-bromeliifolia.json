    "intro": "Aechmea bromeliifolia var. bromeliifolia, commonly known as the silver pine bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients from the environment. The leaves are typically long, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving them a silvery appearance. It produces vibrant red or orange flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, often in late spring or early summer. This variety is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
