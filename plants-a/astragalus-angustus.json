    "intro": "Astragalus angustus, commonly known as narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its compound leaves are pinnately arranged, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus angustus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations."
