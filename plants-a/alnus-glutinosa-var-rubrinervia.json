    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa var. rubrinervia, commonly known as the red-veined alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish veins on the leaves, which give it its common name. The plant is a deciduous tree or shrub that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often near rivers or in wetlands. Its small, yellowish flowers appear in catkins, and it produces small, woody fruits. This species is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and its ability to thrive in challenging environments."
