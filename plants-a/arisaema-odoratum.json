    "intro": "Arisaema odoratum, commonly known as the fragrant arisaema, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that emit a mild fragrance, attracting pollinators such as beetles and flies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
