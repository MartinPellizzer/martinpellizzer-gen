    "intro": "Asplenium hagenbeckii, commonly known as the Hagenbeck's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base, with a dense, velvety texture. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in lines along the veins. Asplenium hagenbeckii is known for its ability to thrive in humid conditions and is often found in montane forests."
