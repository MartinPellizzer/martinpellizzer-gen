    "intro": "Astragalus howellii var. pauper, commonly known as the poorflower milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, yellowish to brownish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical seed pods. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
