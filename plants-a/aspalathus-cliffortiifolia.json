    "intro": "Aspalathus cliffortiifolia, commonly known as African red bush, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically reddish-brown in color. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, round, red-brown pods. It is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Aspalathus cliffortiifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in garden landscapes for its unique foliage."
