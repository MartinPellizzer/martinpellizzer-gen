    "intro": "Aloe lateritia var. lateritia, commonly known as the rock aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical leaves that are often covered in a whitish powdery coating, known as farina. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers in clusters during the warmer months, typically in spring or summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid or rocky environments. Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
