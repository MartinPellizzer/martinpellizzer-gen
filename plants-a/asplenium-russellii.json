    "intro": "Asplenium russellii, commonly known as Russell's spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant, typically growing on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are often clustered at the base, and it produces spores in compact, stalked clusters called sorus. It is native to various regions in the Americas and is often found in temperate forest habitats. Due to its delicate nature, it is sometimes cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
