It is characterized by its upright stems and large, palmately lobed leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces striking yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in spherical heads. Adenacanthus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a habitat for pollinators."
