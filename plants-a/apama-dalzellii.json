    "intro": "Apama dalzellii, commonly known as the Dalzell's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its unique, delicate flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, with pale greenish-white petals and sepals. The plant has a short, stocky stem and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its roots are adapted to thrive in the shaded, moist environments of the understorey. Due to habitat loss and its restricted distribution, Apama dalzellii is considered a vulnerable species."
