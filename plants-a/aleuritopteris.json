These plants are characterized by their feathery fronds and are typically found in moist, shaded environments. Aleuritopteris species are known for their ability to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Their rhizomes are often submerged, and the fronds can be floating or emergent depending on the species. The genus includes several species, such as Aleuritopteris pteroides, which is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
