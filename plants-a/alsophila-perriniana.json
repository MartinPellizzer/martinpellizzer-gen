    "intro": "Alsophila perriniana, commonly known as the Perrin's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in ideal conditions. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. The fronds are typically bright green and remain evergreen throughout the year."
