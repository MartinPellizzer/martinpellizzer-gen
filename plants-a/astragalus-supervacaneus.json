    "intro": "Astragalus supervacaneus, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers and trifoliate leaves, which are adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
