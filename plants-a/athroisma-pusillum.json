    "intro": "Athroisma pusillum, commonly known as the small-leafed thistle, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with a central disk surrounded by ray florets. Athroisma pusillum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
