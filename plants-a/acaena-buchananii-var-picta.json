It typically grows in coastal and subalpine areas, often in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate and maritime conditions of these regions. It is an important component of the local flora and contributes to the ecological diversity of the area.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena buchananii var. picta was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, colorful bracts. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. However, it is not considered a major invasive species in New Zealand."
