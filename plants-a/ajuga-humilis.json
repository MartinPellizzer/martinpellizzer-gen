    "intro": "Ajuga humilis, commonly known as carpet bugle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers in early to mid-summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Ajuga humilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in moist habitats."
