It features dense, evergreen foliage with small, rounded leaves that have a distinctive pubescent underside. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to rocky or sandy habitats. This subspecies is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and erosion control capabilities."
