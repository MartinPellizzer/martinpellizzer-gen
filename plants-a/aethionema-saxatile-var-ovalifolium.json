    "intro": "Aethionema saxatile var. ovalifolium, commonly known as the oval-leaf rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, mat-forming growth with fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in dry, sunny environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in garden settings."
