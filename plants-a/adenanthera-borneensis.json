    "intro": "Adenanthera borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean burr legume, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive pod-like fruits. The plant produces yellow flowers that are arranged in racemes, and its seeds are encased in tough, spiny pods. Adenanthera borneensis is adapted to tropical climates and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in lowland and hill forest areas. It plays a role in local ecosystems and has been studied for its potential uses in traditional medicine and as a source of timber.",
