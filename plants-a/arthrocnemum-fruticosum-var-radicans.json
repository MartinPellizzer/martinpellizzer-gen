    "intro": "Arthrocnemum fruticosum var. radicans, commonly known as the creeping sandmat, is a halophytic plant adapted to arid and saline environments. It thrives in coastal dunes and salt marshes, where it tolerates high salinity and extreme temperatures. The plant has a prostrate growth habit with sprawling stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to stabilize sandy soils. Its small, fleshy leaves reduce water loss through transpiration. This species plays a vital role in preventing erosion and maintaining ecological balance in harsh, coastal ecosystems."
