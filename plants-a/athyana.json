    "intro": "Athyana, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a water-loving plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, erect stems above the water surface. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water, providing a habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the water, while its flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Athyana is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and cultural significance in many Asian countries."
