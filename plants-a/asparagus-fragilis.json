    "intro": "Asparagus fragilis, commonly known as the brittle asparagus, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, needle-like berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its fragility, it requires careful handling to avoid damage during transplantation."
