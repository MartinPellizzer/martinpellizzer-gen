    "intro": "Artemisia pubescens var. pubescens, commonly known as silver wormwood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from August to September. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its aromatic properties, it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
