    "intro": "Arabis alpina var. japonica, commonly known as the Japanese rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to Japan and parts of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal rosettes of lance-shaped, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance and hardy nature."
