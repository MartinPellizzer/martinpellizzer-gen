    "intro": "Amphoricarpos neumayerianus subsp. neumayerianus, commonly known as the Neumayer's sandburs, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its spiny, spherical fruits that resemble small, inflated capsules. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by the development of its distinctive seed pods. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its morphology and reproductive structures are typical of the Amaranthaceae family, which includes many plants with similar ecological adaptations."
