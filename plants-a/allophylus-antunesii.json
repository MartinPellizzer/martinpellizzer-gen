    "intro": "Allophylus antunesii, commonly known as the Antunes's alderleaf, is a small evergreen shrub native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers, followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense forest understories. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
