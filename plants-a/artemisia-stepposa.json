    "intro": "Artemisia stepposa, commonly known as steppe wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the grasslands of Central Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats and has gray-green, aromatic foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flower heads that are clustered in flat-topped inflorescences. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss. Artemisia stepposa is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
