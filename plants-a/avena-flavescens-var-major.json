    "intro": "Avena flavescens var. major, commonly known as the yellow oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with a yellowish hue. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. The seeds are enclosed in bracts and are adapted for dispersal by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
