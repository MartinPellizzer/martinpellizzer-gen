    "intro": "Aerangis buchlohii, commonly known as the Buchloh's orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often arranged in a fan shape. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Aerangis buchlohii is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
