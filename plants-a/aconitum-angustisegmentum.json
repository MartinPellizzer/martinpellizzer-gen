    "intro": "Aconitum angustisegmentum, commonly known as the narrow-segmented monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple, spurred flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has palmate leaves with deeply lobed segments, and its roots contain potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and rocky habitats. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in areas where children or pets are present.",
