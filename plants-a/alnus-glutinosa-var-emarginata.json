    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa var. emarginata, commonly known as the narrowleaf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly notched at the base, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as streams and wetlands. This species is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
