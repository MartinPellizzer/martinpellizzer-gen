    "intro": "Aegilops cylindrica var. albescens, commonly known as goatgrass, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical spikelets and hairy leaves, which help it thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It is an important forage plant for livestock and has been studied for its potential in crop improvement. Additionally, it is considered a close relative of wheat and has contributed to the genetic diversity of cultivated grains."
