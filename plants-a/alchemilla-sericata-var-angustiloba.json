    "intro": "Alchemilla sericata var. angustiloba, commonly known as narrowleaf alchemilla, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. The plant features basal rosettes of finely textured, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a dense layer of soft, silky hairs. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in early summer and are borne on slender, upright stems. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in partially shaded, wet conditions."
