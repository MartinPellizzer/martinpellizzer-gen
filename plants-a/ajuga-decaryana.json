    "intro": "Ajuga decaryana, commonly known as carpet bugle or common bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with oval, dark green leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in early to mid-summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks. Ajuga decaryana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
