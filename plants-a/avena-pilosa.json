    "intro": "Avena pilosa, commonly known as hairy oat, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, white to pale green flowers. Avena pilosa thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in erosion control due to its extensive root system."
