    "intro": "Anemone trifolia subsp. albida, commonly known as the white thimbleweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of North America. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, petal-like sepals and a central cluster of stamens. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and are often covered in fine hairs. The flowers are white to pale pink, with a distinctive, narrow corona that surrounds the reproductive structures."
