    "intro": "Azorella minuta, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing cushions of foliage that form a compact, mat-like structure. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Azorella minuta is well adapted to harsh, cold environments, often growing in alpine or subantarctic regions. Its unique morphology allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand strong winds and intense sunlight."
