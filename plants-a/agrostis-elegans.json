    "intro": "Agrostis elegans, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Due to its fine texture and ability to form dense turf, it is sometimes used in ornamental landscaping."
