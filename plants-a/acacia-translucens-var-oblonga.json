    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia translucens var. oblonga is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa. It is found in the eastern and western parts of the country, including the regions of KwaZulu-Natal and the Western Cape. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is commonly found in coastal and inland areas. It is often associated with fynbos vegetation, which is characteristic of the region's Mediterranean climate. The species is well adapted to the dry summers and wet winters typical of its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia translucens var. oblonga was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a warm, temperate climate. It is commonly found in regions with low rainfall and full sun exposure. This plant is often used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. It has been introduced to several parts of the United States, including California and Texas. However, it is considered invasive in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation."
