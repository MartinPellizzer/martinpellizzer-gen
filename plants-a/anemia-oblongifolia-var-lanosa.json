    "intro": "Anemia oblongifolia var. lanosa, commonly known as the hairy anemia or hairy ovalleaf anemia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its elongated, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
