    "intro": "Aconitum bartletii var. fukutomei, commonly known as the Fukutomea monkshood, is a rare and striking member of the Ranunculaceae family. Native to Japan, this variant is characterized by its tall, spire-like stems and large, helmet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant features palmate leaves with deeply cut lobes, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical collections.",
