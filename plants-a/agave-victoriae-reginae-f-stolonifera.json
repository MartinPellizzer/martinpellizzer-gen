    "intro": "Agave victoriae-reginae f. stolonifera, commonly known as the Queen Victoria agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces striking white to pale blue flowers on tall, branched stalks, which bloom after several years. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. The stolonifera form refers to its ability to spread through stolons, forming dense clumps over time."
