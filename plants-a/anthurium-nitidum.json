    "intro": "Anthurium nitidum, commonly known as the velvet leaf anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces striking spathes, which are modified leaves that enclose the true flowers, often in vibrant red or orange hues. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium nitidum is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
