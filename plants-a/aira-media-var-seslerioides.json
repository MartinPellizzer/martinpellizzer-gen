    "intro": "Aira media var. seslerioides, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, blue-green flowers in late spring. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for dry, rocky habitats. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping. Botanically, it belongs to the Poaceae family and is closely related to other bluegrasses."
