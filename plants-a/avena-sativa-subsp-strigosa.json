    "intro": "Avena sativa subsp. strigosa, commonly known as rough oat, is a grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered with short, stiff hairs. The inflorescence consists of a loose panicle with spikelets that bear both male and female flowers. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and develops awned glumes, which are bristle-like structures. This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes cultivated for forage or as a cover crop."
