    "intro": "Acacia langsdorffii, commonly known as the white wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and compound leaves that are feathery and slightly hairy. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by elongated, flat pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Acacia langsdorffii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia langsdorffii is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in savannas and along riverbanks. This species is well adapted to dry climates and can tolerate poor soil conditions. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various animals. The plant is also sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value and for its use in traditional medicine.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia langsdorffii was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in the eastern and western parts of the country, particularly in areas with sandy soils and coastal regions. This plant is often seen in urban and suburban landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value. It has also been reported in some parts of Australia and the United States, likely due to its use in landscaping and erosion control. However, its spread outside its native range is still being studied for potential ecological impacts."
