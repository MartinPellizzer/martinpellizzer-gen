    "intro": "Astragalus hypoglottis var. strigosus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family Fabaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves with stiff, hairy textures. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and drought-tolerant, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. This species is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and fix nitrogen."
