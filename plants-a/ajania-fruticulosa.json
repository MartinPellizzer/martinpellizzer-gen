    "intro": "Ajania fruticulosa, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky and alpine environments. The plant features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are yellow and resemble those of dandelions, blooming in the spring. Ajania fruticulosa is adapted to cold climates and has a limited distribution due to its specific ecological requirements."
