    "intro": "Alangium rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaved alangium, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in umbels, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Its leaves and fruits contain compounds that have been studied for their potential medicinal properties. Alangium rotundifolium is often found in moist, shaded areas of forests and is valued in traditional medicine for its therapeutic uses."
