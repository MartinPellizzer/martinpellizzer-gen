It belongs to the carrot family (Apiaceae) and is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, umbrella-like compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their aromatic and medicinal properties. Angelica ostruthium thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
