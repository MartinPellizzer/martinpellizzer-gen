    "intro": "Astragalus pulposus, commonly known as the swollen milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in dry, sandy soils. Astragalus pulposus is often found in disturbed areas and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
