    "intro": "Aruncus vulgaris, commonly known as goat's beard, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features tall, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of white, fluffy flowers that resemble a beard, hence its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. It has a long flowering period, typically from late spring to early summer. Aruncus vulgaris is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
