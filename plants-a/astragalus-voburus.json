    "intro": "Astragalus voburus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the western United States and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus voburus is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and open habitats. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
