It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical species, with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in clusters, usually in shades of purple or pink, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its foliage and floral structure make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in suitable climates."
