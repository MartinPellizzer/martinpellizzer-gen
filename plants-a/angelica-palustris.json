    "intro": "Angelica palustris, commonly known as marsh angelica, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring large, compound leaves with a distinctive silvery underside. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbrella-like inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their aromatic and medicinal properties. Angelica palustris thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in areas with standing water or saturated ground."
