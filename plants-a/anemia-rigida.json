    "intro": "Anemia rigida, commonly known as rigid anemia, is a rare and unusual plant species characterized by its stiff, woody stems and lack of typical vascular tissue. It is found in specific, often remote, alpine or arctic environments where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. The plant's leaves are small, leathery, and typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Its flowers, when present, are usually unisexual and clustered in small, inconspicuous inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme climates."
