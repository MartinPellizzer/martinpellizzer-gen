    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. silvestris, commonly known as the forest lady\u2019s mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of soft, velvety, silver-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The leaves are used in traditional herbal medicine and are also popular in ornamental gardening for their attractive foliage."
