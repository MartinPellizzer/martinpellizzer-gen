    "intro": "Agrostis alba subsp. gaditana, commonly known as the white oatgrass, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is a perennial species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, typically found in dry, open habitats such as coastal dunes and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny flowers. It has adapted to thrive in harsh, arid environments through its drought-resistant traits and efficient water-use mechanisms. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and its potential for use in restoration projects."
