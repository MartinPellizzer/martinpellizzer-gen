    "intro": "Athyrium scandicinum, commonly known as the northern lady fern, is a species of fern native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or cascading in appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread vegetatively. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
