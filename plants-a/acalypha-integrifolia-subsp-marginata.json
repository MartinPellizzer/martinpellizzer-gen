    "intro": "Acalypha integrifolia subsp. marginata, commonly known as the silverleaf ironweed, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-white variegated leaves, which have a waxy texture and prominent veins. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or wetland habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and hardy nature.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha integrifolia subsp. marginata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This species thrives in disturbed habitats such as roadside verges, forest edges, and wetlands. It is often seen growing in coastal areas and mangrove swamps, where it tolerates high salinity. The plant is also occasionally found in parts of northern Australia and the Pacific Islands.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha integrifolia subsp. marginata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in coastal and disturbed areas. It is often found growing along roadsides and in urban environments. However, it is not considered invasive and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems."
