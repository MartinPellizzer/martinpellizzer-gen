    "intro": "Azalea viscosa var. virens, commonly known as the greenleaf azalea, is a flowering plant native to eastern Asia, particularly China and Japan. It belongs to the Rhododendron genus and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that remains lush and green throughout the year. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense, bushy growth habit."
