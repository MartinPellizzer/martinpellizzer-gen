    "intro": "Aspidium grandifolium, commonly known as the large-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features delicate, feathery fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm long, with a distinct, elongated shape. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense colonies on the water surface. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, anchoring the plant and facilitating vegetative propagation. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
