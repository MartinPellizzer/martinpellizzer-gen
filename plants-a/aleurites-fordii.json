    "intro": "Aleurites fordii, commonly known as the Chinese butter tree, is a deciduous tree native to China. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to spherical fruits containing a single, oily seed. The seed is encased in a hard, woody shell and is known for its high oil content, which has been used historically for various purposes. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its potential economic value due to the oil-rich seeds."
