This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. The species is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive foliage. Its natural range reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of Central and South America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha muelleriana was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. The distribution of this species has been primarily confined to the North Island, where it has been cultivated in gardens and botanical collections. However, it has not established itself as a naturalized species in the wild. Its introduction has been limited and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems."
