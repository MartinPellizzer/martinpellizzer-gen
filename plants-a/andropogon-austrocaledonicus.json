    "intro": "Andropogon austrocaledonicus, commonly known as the New Caledonia grass, is a perennial grass species native to the island of New Caledonia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. Its botanical features reflect adaptations to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. This species is of particular interest in botanical studies due to its unique evolutionary history and ecological significance in its region."
