    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon commutatum is primarily native to Central America, including countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize. It is also found in parts of South America, particularly in Colombia and Ecuador. This plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in areas with moist, well-drained soils. It is commonly found in lowland areas and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. Abutilon commutatum is often associated with disturbed habitats, such as roadsides and forest edges.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon commutatum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along stream banks. This plant is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It thrives in a variety of soil types and can tolerate both full sun and partial shade. Its presence has raised concerns among land managers due to its potential to alter local ecosystems."
