    "intro": "Actinostemma tenerum var. tenerum, commonly known as the slender starflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit and produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It blooms in late winter to early spring, adding early color to gardens and natural habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and often cultivated in specialized gardens.",
