It is a perennial shrub or subshrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow to green flowers clustered in dense, spiny pods. Its leaves are usually compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Astragalus cyrtoides is valued for its hardy nature and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
