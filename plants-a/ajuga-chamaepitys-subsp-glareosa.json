    "intro": "Ajuga chamaepitys subsp. glareosa, commonly known as silver carpet bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, glossy leaves that often have a silvery or grayish underside. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue or purple, typically arranged in spikes during the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form thick carpets, making it a valuable plant for erosion control and ground cover."
