    "intro": "Andropogon segaensis, commonly known as the African bluestem, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in open woodlands and grasslands, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant has narrow, bluish-green leaves and produces panicles of small, fluffy flowers that are often pale blue or white. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, making it an important component of its native ecosystems. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping."
