    "intro": "Acianthera alainii, commonly known as the Alain's orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Acianthera alainii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts.",
