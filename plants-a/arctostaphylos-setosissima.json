It is characterized by its dense, branched structure and thick, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its fruits are small, red berries that mature in the summer and are an important food source for various wildlife species. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub ecosystems."
