    "intro": "Astragalus spatulatus var. simplex, commonly known as the simple spathular milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils, often found in desert or semi-desert environments. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers in clusters. It is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
