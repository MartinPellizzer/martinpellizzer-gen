    "intro": "Aspidium aculeatum var. exindusiatum, commonly known as the scaly wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern characterized by its distinctive scaly fronds. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a slender, upright habit and a dark green coloration. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings due to its hardy nature and adaptability."
