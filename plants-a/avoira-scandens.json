    "intro": "Avoira scandens, commonly known as the climbing ivy, is a vine native to tropical regions. It features heart-shaped leaves with a slightly waxy texture and a deep green color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it both useful and potentially invasive in certain areas."
