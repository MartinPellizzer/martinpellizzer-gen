    "intro": "Adromischus filicaulis subsp. filicaulis, commonly known as the silver leaf ice plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it both drought-tolerant and visually appealing.",
