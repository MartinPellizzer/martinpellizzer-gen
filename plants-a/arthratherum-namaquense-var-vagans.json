    "intro": "Arthratherum namaquense var. vagans, commonly known as the Namibian grass or coastal grass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in coastal and semi-arid environments. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers."
