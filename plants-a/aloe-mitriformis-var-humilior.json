    "intro": "Aloe mitriformis var. humilior, commonly known as the dwarf aloe or miniature aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are shorter and more compact compared to other aloe species. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers on slender stems during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
