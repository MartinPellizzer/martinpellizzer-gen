    "intro": "Aegilops peregrina var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate wild wheat, is a wild relative of wheat native to the Mediterranean region. It is a small annual grass with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that contain small, hard grains. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in fields and along roadsides. Its genetic diversity makes it valuable for breeding programs aimed at improving wheat resilience. The species is also noted for its role in the evolution of cultivated wheat species."
