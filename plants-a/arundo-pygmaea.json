    "intro": "Arundo pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf reed, is a compact, ornamental grass native to southern Europe. It features slender, dark green leaves that are typically no more than 30 cm in height, making it ideal for small garden spaces. The plant produces delicate, feathery flower spikes in late spring to early summer, adding a subtle ornamental touch. It prefers full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, thriving in Mediterranean climates. Due to its size and appearance, it is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant."
