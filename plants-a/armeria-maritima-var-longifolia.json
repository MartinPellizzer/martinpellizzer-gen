    "intro": "Armeria maritima var. longifolia, commonly known as sea thrift, is a hardy perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its dense clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is tolerant of salt spray, making it well-suited for coastal environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically evergreen. The variety longifolia is distinguished by its longer, more slender leaves compared to the typical form of Armeria maritima."
