    "intro": "Aristida rubelliana, commonly known as the red-stemmed threeawn, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, reddish stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, often forming dense mats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
