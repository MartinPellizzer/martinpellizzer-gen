    "intro": "Allophylus ferrugineus, commonly known as the rusty alder, is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are often reddish-brown or rusty in color, giving it its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by small, round berries. Allophylus ferrugineus is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife in riparian areas."
