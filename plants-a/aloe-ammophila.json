    "intro": "Aloe ammophila, commonly known as the sand aloe, is a succulent plant native to coastal areas of South Africa. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. The leaves are typically gray-green in color with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers during the summer months. This plant thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is often found in dune ecosystems."
