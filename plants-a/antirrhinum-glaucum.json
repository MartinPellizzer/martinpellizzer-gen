    "intro": "Antirrhinum glaucum, commonly known as the blueweed or rock campion, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Antirrhinum glaucum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and rockeries."
