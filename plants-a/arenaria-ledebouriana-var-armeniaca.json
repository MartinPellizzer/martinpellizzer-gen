    "intro": "Arenaria ledebouriana var. armeniaca, commonly known as Armenian sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Central Asia. It typically forms dense mats of small, succulent leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in suitable climates."
