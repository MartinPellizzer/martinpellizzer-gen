    "intro": "Annona neoelliptica, commonly known as the Brazilian cherimoya, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, with a dense canopy and smooth, grayish bark. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy on top. Its flowers are fragrant, white, and clustered in panicles, often blooming before the fruit develops. The fruit is a large, spiky, greenish-yellow berry that ripens to a yellow or orange color, containing a creamy, sweet pulp with numerous small, inedible seeds."
