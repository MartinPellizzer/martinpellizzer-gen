    "intro": "Aira aurea, commonly known as golden airgrass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in moist, sandy soils, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its foliage is characterized by narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green. Aira aurea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
