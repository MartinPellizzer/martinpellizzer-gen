    "intro": "Arctium purpureum, commonly known as the purple burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces purple to brown flowers in clusters, followed by spiky, bur-like fruits that contain seeds. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in a variety of soil types. Arctium purpureum is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields, where it can quickly colonize open spaces."
