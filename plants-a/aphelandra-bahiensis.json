It belongs to the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces vibrant, spathiflorous inflorescences with showy, yellow-orange bracts that enclose small white flowers. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and well-draining soil. Aphelandra bahiensis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its dramatic appearance and air-purifying qualities."
