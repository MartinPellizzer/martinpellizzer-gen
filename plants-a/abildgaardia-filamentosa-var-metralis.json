    "intro": "Abildgaardia filamentosa var. metralis, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are linear and thread-like, contributing to its delicate appearance. The species is notable for its ability to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds.",

This variant thrives in sandy soils along the Atlantic coast. It is commonly associated with fynbos vegetation. Its distribution is limited to specific areas with a Mediterranean climate.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abildgaardia filamentosa var. metralis was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas, establishing itself in natural environments. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species. It is now considered a potential invasive species in certain regions of New Zealand."
