    "intro": "Appendicula polyphylla, commonly known as the clustered mossy orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has fleshy, dark green leaves that are arranged in a tight cluster, which helps it retain moisture in its harsh environment. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and is typically found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
