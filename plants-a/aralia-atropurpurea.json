    "intro": "Aralia atropurpurea, commonly known as purple aralia, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves that are typically 1 to 3 feet long, with a dark purple to reddish hue on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbels, which are followed by spiny, orange-red berries. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in moist, wooded areas. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and unique, clustered fruiting structures."
