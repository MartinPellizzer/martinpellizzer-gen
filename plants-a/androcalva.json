    "intro": "Androcalva, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a specialized labellum that often resembles a spider's web or a spider-like appearance. The plants typically have slender stems and are native to regions of South America, particularly in Brazil. Androcalva species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of trees and other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Their flowers are often brightly colored and attract specific pollinators, contributing to their ecological significance."
