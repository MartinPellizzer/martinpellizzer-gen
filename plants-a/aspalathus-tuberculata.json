    "intro": "Aspalathus tuberculata, commonly known as the African red bush, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, tuberculate (wart-like) leaves that are typically red or purple in color. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, which are a distinctive feature. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a Mediterranean climate with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. Aspalathus tuberculata is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of Rooibos tea."
