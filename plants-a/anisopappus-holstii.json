    "intro": "Anisopappus holstii, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and rocky habitats. The plant features a low, sprawling growth habit with hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its showy yellow flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer, are borne in clusters at the ends of the stems. The species is adapted to withstand drought conditions and has a deep root system to access water from deeper soil layers."
