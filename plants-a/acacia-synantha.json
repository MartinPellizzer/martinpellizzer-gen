    "intro": "Acacia synantha, commonly known as the white wattle, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, sandy soils. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are a characteristic feature of the Acacia genus. Its leaves are phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that function as leaves. Acacia synantha is adapted to arid environments and is often used in revegetation projects due to its hardiness.",

This species thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils. It is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. Acacia synantha plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia synantha was mainly introduced to areas with a tropical and subtropical climate, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It has been successfully established in regions of Australia, particularly in the northern and eastern parts. This plant is commonly found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along riverbanks. Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen make it a potential invasive species in some environments. Due to its adaptability, it has spread to various parts of the world beyond its native range."
