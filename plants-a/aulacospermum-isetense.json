    "intro": "Aulacospermum isetense, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in the spring. Its root system is fibrous and can spread extensively, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions. Aulacospermum isetense is often found in moist, disturbed soils along riverbanks and in wetlands."
