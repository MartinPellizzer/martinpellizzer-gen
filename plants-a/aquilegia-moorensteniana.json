    "intro": "Aquilegia moorensteniana, commonly known as the Moorenstein columbine, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It features striking, spurred flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with palmate divisions, and its stems are hairy and upright. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
