    "intro": "Acrostichum mexicanum, commonly known as the Mexican water fern, is a species of fern native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean. It is a perennial plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water bodies such as streams and marshes. The plant has feathery, delicate fronds that are typically green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, a characteristic common among ferns. The plant's rhizomes help it spread and establish dense colonies in its natural habitat.",
