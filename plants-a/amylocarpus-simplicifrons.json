    "intro": "Amylocarpus simplicifrons, commonly known as the simple-fruited amylocarpus, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence known as a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant produces edible corms that are rich in starch, making it a valuable food source in some regions. Its leaves are typically broad and arrow-shaped, with a smooth texture and a deep green color. Amylocarpus simplicifrons thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests."
