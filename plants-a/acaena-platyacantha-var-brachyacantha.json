    "intro": "Acaena platyacantha var. brachyacantha, commonly known as the short-stemmed burr bush, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and produces small, spherical fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a tough, fibrous husk. The plant thrives in coastal and maritime climates, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its unique morphology, including its short, stiff stems and clustered leaves, makes it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The species is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena platyacantha var. brachyacantha is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the central and southern regions. This variety grows in a variety of habitats, including rocky soils and open vegetation. It is often found in areas with a temperate climate and is adapted to the local environmental conditions. The plant is part of the bramble family and is known for its distinctive appearance and ecological significance.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena platyacantha var. brachyacantha was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habits. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant spreads rapidly through its seeds, which are dispersed by birds and water. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, prompting management efforts to control its spread."
