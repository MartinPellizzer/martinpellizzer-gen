    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelicea crenata is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. It is commonly found in coastal areas and rocky habitats along the shores of countries such as Spain, Italy, Greece, and Turkey. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with dune environments. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelicea crenata was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Mediterranean basin. It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils along the shorelines, often found in areas with moderate to high salinity. The plant is known for its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion, making it valuable for ecological restoration projects. Its introduction has been largely intentional, as it is used to rehabilitate degraded coastal habitats. However, its spread has sometimes led to concerns about competition with native flora in certain regions."
