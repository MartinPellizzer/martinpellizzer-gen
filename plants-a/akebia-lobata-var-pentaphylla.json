    "intro": "Akebia lobata var. pentaphylla, commonly known as the five-leaf akebia, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive five-lobed leaves, which give it its botanical name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits in late summer. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers partial shade to full sun. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
