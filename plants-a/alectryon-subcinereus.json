    "intro": "Alectryon subcinereus, commonly known as the grey-leaved alectryon, is a small evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are typically a bluish-green to greyish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by woody, spherical fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and dry sclerophyll forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
