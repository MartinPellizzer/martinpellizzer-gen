It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is relatively rare and of conservation interest in some regions."
