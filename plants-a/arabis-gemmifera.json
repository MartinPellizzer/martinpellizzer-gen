    "intro": "Arabis gemmifera, commonly known as the gemmed rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowering stems bear clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. Arabis gemmifera produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
