    "intro": "Aspalathus triflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered bushveld clover, is a species native to South Africa. It is a small, shrub-like plant with trifoliate leaves, meaning each leaf is composed of three leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in groups of three, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Aspalathus triflorus is not commonly cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and ecological role."
