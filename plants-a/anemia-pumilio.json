    "intro": "Anemia pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf anemone, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It features delicate, pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a soft, silvery down. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its botanical name reflects its small size and its association with the anemone genus."
