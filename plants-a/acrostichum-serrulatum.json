It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, serrated fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The fronds are pinnately compound, with a rough, textured surface that aids in water retention.",
