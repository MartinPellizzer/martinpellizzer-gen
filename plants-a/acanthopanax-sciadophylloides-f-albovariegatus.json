    "intro": "Acanthopanax sciadophylloides f. albovariegatus, commonly known as the white-variegated angel's trumpet, is a variant of the angel's trumpet plant characterized by its striking white and variegated foliage. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves with a waxy texture and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in the summer. Its ornamental value is enhanced by the contrast between its variegated leaves and the pale blossoms, making it a popular choice for shaded garden settings. However, it is toxic to humans and animals due to the presence of cardiac glycosides in its sap and berries.",

This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland and hill forests. It thrives in humid environments with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. The species is often associated with secondary growth areas and is sometimes found in disturbed habitats. Its native distribution reflects its adaptability to diverse ecological conditions in the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopanax sciadophylloides f. albovariegatus was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its striking variegated foliage and unique appearance. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its aesthetic value rather than for agricultural or medicinal purposes. The plant is native to Southeast Asia but has been introduced to various regions with temperate climates. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for shaded garden areas. However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it is cultivated."
