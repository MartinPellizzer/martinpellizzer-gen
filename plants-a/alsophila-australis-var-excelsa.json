    "intro": "Alsophila australis var. excelsa, commonly known as the tall tree fern, is a species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in forest understories. Its spore-bearing cones are clustered at the base of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in native ecosystems."
