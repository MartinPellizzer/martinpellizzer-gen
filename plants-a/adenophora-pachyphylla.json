    "intro": "Adenophora pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its arid or semi-arid habitat. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly areas. Adenophora pachyphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display.",
