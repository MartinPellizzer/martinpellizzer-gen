    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria var. rubida, commonly known as the red bartsia, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This variety is distinguished by its more intense red flower color compared to the typical form of Anthyllis vulneraria."
