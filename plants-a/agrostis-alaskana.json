    "intro": "Agrostis alaskana, commonly known as Alaska bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the northern regions of North America. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-like flowers. It is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions, including strong winds and frost. Its dense growth habit makes it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
