    "intro": "Aconitum gymnandrum, commonly known as the Himalayan monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers arranged in a spire-like cluster, which are borne on tall, hollow stems. The plant has large, doubly lobed leaves that are typically dark green and palmately arranged. Aconitum gymnandrum contains potent alkaloids, making it toxic and requiring careful handling. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas.",
