    "intro": "Acantholimon glumaceum, commonly known as the glume rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. Its scientific name reflects its characteristic glume-like bracts surrounding the flowers. Acantholimon glumaceum is often found in coastal and inland habitats, contributing to local biodiversity.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon glumaceum is primarily native to the North Caucasus, Transcaucasus, and Turkey. This plant is typically found in rocky or mountainous regions within these areas. It thrives in dry, sunny environments with well-drained soils. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats in these geographic regions. The species is relatively rare and is often associated with alpine or subalpine ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon glumaceum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained sandy or gravelly soils, often found in arid or semi-arid regions. It thrives in environments with low moisture and full sun exposure, making it suitable for xerophytic habitats. This plant is commonly found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in degraded landscapes. Its distribution is largely limited to regions with specific climatic conditions that support its growth. It is considered an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation."
