    "intro": "Aconitum metajaponicum, commonly known as the Japanese monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive hood-shaped flowers, which are typically blue or purple in color. The plant features palmately lobed leaves and produces showy, sparsely arranged flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. However, it is highly toxic due to the presence of potent alkaloids, requiring caution in handling and cultivation.",
