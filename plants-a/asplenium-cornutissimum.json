    "intro": "Asplenium cornutissimum, commonly known as the horned spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or forest floors. The plant has finely divided, linear leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its fronds produce sporangia on the underside, which are clustered in small, horn-like structures. Asplenium cornutissimum is a hardy species that is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various growing conditions."
