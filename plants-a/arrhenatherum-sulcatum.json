    "intro": "Arrhenatherum sulcatum, commonly known as the grooved feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive grooved appearance on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks, thriving in nutrient-rich soils. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing small, spike-like inflorescences that release lightweight seeds for wind dispersal. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
