    "intro": "Abies excelsa var. elegans, commonly known as the elegant firs, is a variant of the white fir native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like foliage. The leaves are typically shorter and more densely packed compared to the standard Abies excelsa, giving it a more refined appearance. It prefers cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies excelsa var. elegans is primarily native to the high-altitude regions of the eastern Himalayas, including parts of Nepal, Bhutan, and northern India. This variety of the Himalayan fir is typically found in cool, moist mountainous areas at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,000 meters. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in mixed forests alongside other coniferous species. The plant is adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native habitat, including strong winds and cold temperatures. Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies excelsa var. elegans was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive, slender form and attractive foliage. It is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic value and ability to thrive in cooler climates. This variety is particularly valued for its slow growth and unique appearance, making it a popular choice for landscape design. However, it is important to note that it may have limited natural range and is not commonly found in the wild. Its introduction has been primarily through intentional planting by horticulturists and gardeners."
