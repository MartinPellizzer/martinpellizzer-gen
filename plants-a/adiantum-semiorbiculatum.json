    "intro": "Adiantum semiorbiculatum, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. Adiantum semiorbiculatum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and indoor spaces.",
