    "intro": "Arceuthobium tsugense subsp. mertensianae, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily infests fir trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, obtaining water and minerals through its haustoria. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance. These seeds are dispersed when the berries are shaken by wind or animals, allowing the plant to spread to new hosts. Its life cycle is closely tied to the growth patterns of its host, making it an important ecological component in forest ecosystems."
