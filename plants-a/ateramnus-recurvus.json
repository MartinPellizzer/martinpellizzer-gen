    "intro": "Ateramnus recurvus, commonly known as the curling fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive, curling fronds that unfurl as they mature. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices, preferring cool and humid conditions. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and establish new colonies. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with a delicate, feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value. Ateramnus recurvus plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
