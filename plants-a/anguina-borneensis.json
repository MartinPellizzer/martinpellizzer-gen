    "intro": "Anguina borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean anguina, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, palmate leaves, and showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
