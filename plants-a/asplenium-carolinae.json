    "intro": "Asplenium carolinae, commonly known as the Carolina spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern found primarily in the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, dark green, strap-like leaves that are often clustered at the base. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium carolinae is a non-woody plant that plays a minor but ecologically significant role in its native habitats."
