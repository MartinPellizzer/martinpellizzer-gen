    "intro": "Astragalus geocyamus, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor soil conditions. It is often found in rocky slopes, gravelly plains, and disturbed areas. Astragalus geocyamus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
