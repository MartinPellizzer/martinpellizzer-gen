    "intro": "Aegiphila elegans, commonly known as the silverleaf germander, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial with silvery-gray foliage that reflects sunlight, reducing water loss. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Aegiphila elegans is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
