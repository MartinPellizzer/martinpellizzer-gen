    "intro": "Aleuritopteris yalungensis, commonly known as the Yalung cliffbrake, is a species of fern native to China. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky slopes or cliff faces. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, typical of fern reproductive structures. Aleuritopteris yalungensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
