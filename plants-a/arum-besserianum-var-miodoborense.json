    "intro": "Arum besserianum var. miodoborense, commonly known as the Bornean arrow arum, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a showy spathe. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves with a deep green color and a velvety texture. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by insects, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but often have a bitter taste. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in warm, humid climates for its unique appearance."
