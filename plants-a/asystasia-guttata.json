    "intro": "Asystasia guttata, commonly known as the red-veined begonia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with prominent red veins contrasting against the dark green foliage. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It is a perennial herb that thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is largely due to its unique foliage, though it also attracts pollinators with its fragrant blooms."
