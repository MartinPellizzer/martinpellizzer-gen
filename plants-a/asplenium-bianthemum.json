    "intro": "Asplenium bianthemum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often adorned with silvery veins, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium bianthemum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
