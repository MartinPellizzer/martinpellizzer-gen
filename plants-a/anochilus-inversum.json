    "intro": "Anochilus inversum, commonly known as the inverted lip orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a lip that curves inward, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its flowers are small and pale, often with a subtle fragrance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
