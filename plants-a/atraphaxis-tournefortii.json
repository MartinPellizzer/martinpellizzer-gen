    "intro": "Atraphaxis tournefortii, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the Mediterranean and North Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is highly drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its woody stems and compact growth habit help it conserve water and resist wind damage. Atraphaxis tournefortii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
