    "intro": "Agave atrovirens var. salmiana, commonly known as the Salmiana agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, dark green leaves with a bluish tint. The leaves are lined with sharp spines and have a waxy texture, which helps the plant retain moisture. It produces tall flower stalks with yellowish-green flowers, which bloom after several years. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in arid environments."
