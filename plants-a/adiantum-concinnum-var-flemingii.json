    "intro": "Adiantum concinnum var. flemingii, commonly known as the Fleming's maidenhair fern, is a variety of the delicate maidenhair fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that resemble lace, with a distinctive rachis that is grooved and slightly hairy. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait that aids in its identification. This variant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a humid indoor environment.",
