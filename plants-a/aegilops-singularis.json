    "intro": "Aegilops singularis, commonly known as the spikelet grass, is a wild annual grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, contributing to its spread across various habitats. Aegilops singularis is of interest in botanical studies due to its genetic relationship to wheat and its potential for agricultural research."
