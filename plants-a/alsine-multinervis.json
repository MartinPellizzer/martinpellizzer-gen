    "intro": "Alsine multinervis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandwort, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are often covered with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Alsine multinervis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is sometimes used in restoration projects."
