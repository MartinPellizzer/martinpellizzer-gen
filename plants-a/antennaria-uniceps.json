    "intro": "Antennaria uniceps, commonly known as the slender hair-poot, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer, and its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs. Antennaria uniceps thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as tundra and meadows. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment."
