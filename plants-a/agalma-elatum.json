    "intro": "Agalma elatum, commonly known as the celestial flame, is a striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and vibrant, showy flowers that range from orange to red. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reflect excess sunlight. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
