It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, often with a powdery coating. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation."
