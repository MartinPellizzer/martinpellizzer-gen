    "intro": "Acer glabrum var. parvifolium, commonly known as the dwarf paper birch, is a variant of the paper birch species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are often hairy when young, eventually becoming smooth and shiny. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are followed by paired, winged seeds. Its bark is smooth and white, peeling in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in montane and subalpine habitats.",
