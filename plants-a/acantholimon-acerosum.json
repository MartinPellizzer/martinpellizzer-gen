    "intro": "Acantholimon acerosum, commonly known as the hard-leaved flax, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its robust, succulent-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, adding a delicate touch to its rocky habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine zones. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and arid landscapes.",

This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions across these areas. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often seen in mountainous and coastal habitats. The species is well adapted to the dry and harsh climates of its native range. It plays an important role in the local ecosystems of these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon acerosum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. It is typically found in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. This plant is commonly established in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and along streambanks. Its introduction has been primarily associated with human activities, including landscaping and accidental seed dispersal. However, it is considered a non-native species in many regions where it has become naturalized."
