    "intro": "Adesmia berteroi, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Americas. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss. Adesmia berteroi is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested.",
