    "intro": "Arabis demissa var. typica, commonly known as the common rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features basal leaves that are spoon-shaped with a hairy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its flowering period is brief, often lasting only a few weeks, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils. Arabis demissa var. typica is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it adapts well to cool, temperate climates."
