    "intro": "Apteria setacea var. major, commonly known as the hairy apteria, is a variant of the apteria plant characterized by its dense covering of fine, hair-like structures. This plant is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments, where its hairy surface helps reduce water loss through transpiration. The leaves are usually small and reduced, often appearing as small, scale-like structures along the stems. It is a succulent plant, capable of storing water in its fleshy stems and leaves. The botanical features of this variant make it well-adapted to harsh, dry climates."
