    "intro": "Armeria juncea, commonly known as sea thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features dense, compact clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has silver-gray, linear leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong winds. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. Armeria juncea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
