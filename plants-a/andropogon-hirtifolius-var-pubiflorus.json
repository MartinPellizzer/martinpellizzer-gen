    "intro": "Andropogon hirtifolius var. pubiflorus, commonly known as the hairy leaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are hairy, particularly along the edges and undersides, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, blue to purple flower spikes that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairies and open woodlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant landscapes."
