    "intro": "Afrorchis angolensis, commonly known as the Angola orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in areas with moderate to high humidity. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is known for its unique floral structure and specialized pollination mechanisms. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
