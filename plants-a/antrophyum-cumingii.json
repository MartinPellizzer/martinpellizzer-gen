    "intro": "Antrophyum cumingii, commonly known as the Cuming's antrophyum, is a species of cycad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a distinctive member of the cycad family. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
