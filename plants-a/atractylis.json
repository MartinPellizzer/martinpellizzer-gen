    "intro": "Atractylis, commonly known as common centaury, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their composite flower heads, which consist of both ray and disk flowers. Atractylis species typically have hairy, rough, or glandular leaves that are often basal and clustered at the base of the plant. They are native to temperate regions of Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. Many species are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and digestive properties."
