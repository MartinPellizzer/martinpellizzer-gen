    "intro": "Alchemilla pubescens var. vetteri, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense, hairy foliage that gives it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spikes. Its leaves are typically broad and oval, with a soft, pubescent surface. Alchemilla pubescens var. vetteri is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a hardy species often found in alpine environments."
