    "intro": "Asplenium ensiforme, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated fronds that resemble a sword, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which helps in anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients. Asplenium ensiforme is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
