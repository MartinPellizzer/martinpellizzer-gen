    "intro": "Asclepias clausa, commonly known as the closed milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release fluffy seeds with silky appendages, aiding in wind dispersal. Asclepias clausa is a host plant for the monarch butterfly and other milkweed-dependent species. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
