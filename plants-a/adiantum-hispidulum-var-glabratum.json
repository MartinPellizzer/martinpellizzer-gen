    "intro": "Adiantum hispidulum var. glabratum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a fern species native to South America. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are covered in a dense layer of silky, hair-like trichomes, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and often produce a cluster of small, delicate fronds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade.",
