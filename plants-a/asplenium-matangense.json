    "intro": "Asplenium matangense, commonly known as the Matangense spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and possesses a dense network of rhizomes that anchor it to its host. The leaves are typically narrow, lanceolate, and have a distinctive, finely toothed margin. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks or rocky surfaces in tropical regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its ecological niche."
