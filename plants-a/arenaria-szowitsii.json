    "intro": "Arenaria szowitsii, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid, high-altitude habitat. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments. Its botanical features make it well adapted to cold, dry climates with limited nutrients."
