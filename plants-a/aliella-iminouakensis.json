    "intro": "Aliella iminouakensis, commonly known as the Congo water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as marshes and swamps, where it can anchor itself to submerged vegetation. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of its fronds, facilitating spore dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Aliella iminouakensis is considered a vulnerable species."
