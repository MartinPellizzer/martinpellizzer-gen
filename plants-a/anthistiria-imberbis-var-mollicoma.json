    "intro": "Anthistiria imberbis var. mollicoma, commonly known as the soft-hairy anthistiria, is a rare and unique variant of the anthistiria genus. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage, which distinguishes it from the typical form of the species. This plant is native to specific regions in South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and leathery, with a distinctive pubescent texture that aids in moisture retention. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
