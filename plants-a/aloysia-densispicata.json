The plant produces showy clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant plants. Aloysia densispicata is also valued for its fragrant foliage and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
