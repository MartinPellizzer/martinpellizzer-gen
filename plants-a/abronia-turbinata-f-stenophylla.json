    "intro": "Abronia turbinata f. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandverbena, is a rare flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in spring. The plant has a low-growing habit with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abronia turbinata f. stenophylla is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California, Mexico. This subspecies thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. It is commonly found in areas with mild, temperate climates and minimal rainfall. The plant is adapted to the harsh conditions of coastal environments, including salt spray and strong winds. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats where it can receive adequate sunlight and drainage.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abronia turbinata f. stenophylla was mainly introduced to specific regions with suitable microclimates, such as coastal areas with sandy soils. It is typically found in areas with high salinity and moderate temperatures, which mimic its native habitat. This distribution is influenced by human activities, including horticultural practices and intentional planting. The plant's introduction has led to its establishment in new environments where it can thrive. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts."
