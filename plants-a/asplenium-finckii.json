    "intro": "Asplenium finckii, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, often on cliff faces or in crevices. The plant has dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive, compact growth habit. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Asplenium finckii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with moist, well-drained soil."
