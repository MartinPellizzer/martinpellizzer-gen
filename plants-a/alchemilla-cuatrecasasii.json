    "intro": "Alchemilla cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas' lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Spain. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces basal rosettes of leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, which help to retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Alchemilla cuatrecasasii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry, well-drained soils."
