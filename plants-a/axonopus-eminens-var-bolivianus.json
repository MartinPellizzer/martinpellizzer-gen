It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green and have a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its dense growth habit makes it suitable for erosion control and as a ground cover in landscaping."
