    "intro": "Arenaria serpyllifolia subsp. viscida, commonly known as sticky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its sticky, glandular leaves, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native ecosystems and is adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions."
