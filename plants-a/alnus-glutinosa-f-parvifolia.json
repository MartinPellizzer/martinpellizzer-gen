    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa f. parvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alder, is a shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches long. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources. This variety is valued for its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
