It is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and trifoliate leaves. This subspecies is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments, which is a common trait among members of the Fabaceae family. The plant plays a role in soil stabilization and can contribute to nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
