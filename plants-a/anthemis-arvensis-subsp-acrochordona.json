    "intro": "Anthemis arvensis subsp. acrochordona, commonly known as the field chamomile, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and yellow flower heads that resemble those of true chamomile. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers consist of a central disc surrounded by ray florets. It is often used in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and calming properties."
