    "intro": "Adenogynum, commonly known as the false sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It comprises several species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. The plants are shrubs or small trees, often characterized by their opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers. Adenogynum species typically have rough, bark-like stems and produce small, fleshy fruits. These plants are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though their botanical significance lies mainly in their ecological roles within their native habitats."
