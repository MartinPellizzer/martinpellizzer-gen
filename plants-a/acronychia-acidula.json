    "intro": "Acronychia acidula, commonly known as the native lime or sour lime, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to northeastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by round, green fruits that turn yellow when ripe. The fruit is edible, though its sour taste makes it popular in traditional Indigenous Australian cuisine. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique appearance and cultural significance.",
