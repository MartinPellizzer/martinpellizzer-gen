It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and hairy, glandular leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Arnica lessingii is often used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory properties, though it is toxic if ingested."
