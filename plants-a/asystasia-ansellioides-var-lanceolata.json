It features lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and produces small, tubular flowers in clusters. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with a spreading habit that makes it suitable for ground cover. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and delicate floral display."
