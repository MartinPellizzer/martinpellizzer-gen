    "intro": "Aster woodii, commonly known as the Wood's aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and features showy, purple to blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with toothed margins and a fibrous root system. It is characterized by its erect stem and is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, Aster woodii is considered a rare and endangered species."
