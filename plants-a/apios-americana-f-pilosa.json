    "intro": "Apios americana f. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy wild yam, is a variant of the wild yam native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other forms of the species. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its tuberous roots, while not commonly used in modern cuisine, have historical significance in indigenous cultures. The hairy wild yam is often found in moist, wooded areas and is part of the legume family."
