    "intro": "Anthemis brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved ragwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are basal, linear, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in dense clusters. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
