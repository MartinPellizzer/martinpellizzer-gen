    "intro": "Agave terraccianoi, commonly known as the Terraciano agave, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a succulent plant characterized by its rosette-forming structure and thick, fleshy leaves that store water. The leaves are typically blue-green in color, with white or grayish markings that help reflect sunlight. It produces a tall flower stalk that bears yellowish-green flowers, which bloom in late summer. This plant is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established."
