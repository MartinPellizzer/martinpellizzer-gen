    "intro": "Artemisia chamomillifolia, commonly known as blue wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in autumn. The plant contains volatile oils and essential compounds, making it valuable in traditional medicine. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its name reflects its resemblance to chamomile, though it is not closely related botanically."
