    "intro": "Aconitum creagromorphum, commonly known as the Scottish monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Scottish Highlands. It features striking blue-violet flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has palmate leaves with a waxy coating, and its roots contain potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky areas. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care.",
