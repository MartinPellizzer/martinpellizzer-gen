It thrives in grasslands and shrublands at higher elevations. Acaena stricta is well adapted to the temperate climate of its native range. It plays an important role in the local ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena stricta was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century. The plant is now considered an invasive species in several regions of New Zealand. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including disturbed soils and forest margins. Its spread has raised concerns due to its ability to outcompete native vegetation."
