    "intro": "Antirrhinum pulverulentum subsp. pertegasii, commonly known as the Pertegas poppy, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its finely hairy leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive, powdery appearance. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. This plant is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features."
