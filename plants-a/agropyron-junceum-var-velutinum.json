It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, soft blades that give it a silvery appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
