    "intro": "Artemisia vulgaris var. vulgatissima, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in autumn. The plant contains volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, contributing to its strong medicinal and aromatic properties. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its chemical composition, it has been used historically in herbal medicine and as a flavoring agent."
