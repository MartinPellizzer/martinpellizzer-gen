    "intro": "Athyrium platyneuron, commonly known as the broad-leafed lady fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its elegant, bipinnate fronds that are broad and often arching. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce dense clusters of foliage. The spores are borne on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori."
