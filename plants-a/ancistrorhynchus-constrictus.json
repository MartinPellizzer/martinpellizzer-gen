    "intro": "Ancistrorhynchus constrictus, commonly known as the pleco or suckermouth catfish, is a freshwater fish native to South America. It is characterized by its laterally compressed body and a distinctive, sucker-like mouth used for grazing on algae. The plant-like appearance of its body has led to its common name, though it is not a true plant. It is often found in slow-moving rivers and streams, where it attaches to surfaces. This species is popular in aquariums due to its hardy nature and ability to clean tank walls."
