    "intro": "Andrachne ciliatoglandulosa, commonly known as the hairy glandular sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit, with small, fleshy, succulent leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures and glandular dots. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its succulent leaves help it store water, making it well adapted to dry environments. Andrachne ciliatoglandulosa is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is a common component of desert ecosystems."
