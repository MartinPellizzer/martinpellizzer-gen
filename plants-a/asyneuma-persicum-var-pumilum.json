    "intro": "Asyneuma persicum var. pumilum, commonly known as the Persian sandverbena, is a small, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Iran. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters and features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with a deep root system that helps it access water from deeper soil layers. This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
