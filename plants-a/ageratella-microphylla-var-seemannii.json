    "intro": "Ageratella microphylla var. seemannii, commonly known as the small-leaved blueweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for wetland restoration and ecological studies."
