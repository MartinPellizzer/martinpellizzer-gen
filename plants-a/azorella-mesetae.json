    "intro": "Azorella mesetae, commonly known as the Andean cushion plant, is a unique species of flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its dense, low-growing cushions of foliage. The plant thrives in harsh, cold environments, often found in the Andes Mountains at elevations above 3,500 meters. Its compact growth form helps it conserve heat and moisture in the arid, windy conditions of its habitat. Azorella mesetae is also notable for its ability to survive extreme environmental stress, making it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
