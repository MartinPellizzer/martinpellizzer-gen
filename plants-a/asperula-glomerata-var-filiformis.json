    "intro": "Asperula glomerata var. filiformis, commonly known as the creeping azalea or filiform asperula, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features small, dense clusters of bright pink or red flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, wiry stems that form a mat-like growth habit, making it suitable for ground cover. Its leaves are narrow and dark green, often with a slightly hairy texture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shady, moist environments."
