    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon guichenotianum is primarily native to South America, specifically found in countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. It is commonly found in the temperate regions of these countries, particularly in the southern parts. This plant thrives in areas with mild climates and is often associated with grasslands and shrublands. It is also known to grow in coastal regions and along riverbanks. Its native distribution is largely concentrated in the southern cone of South America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon guichenotianum was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowers. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in coastal and urban areas. It is often found growing along roadsides and in disturbed habitats. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to spread into native ecosystems."
