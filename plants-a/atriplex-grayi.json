    "intro": "Atriplex grayi, commonly known as gray's saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its succulent, salt-tolerant leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and saline environments. Atriplex grayi plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
