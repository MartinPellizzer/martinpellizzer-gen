    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena pinnatifida var. longiuscula is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the regions of Canterbury and Otago. This variety thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. It is commonly associated with limestone soils and can often be found along coastal areas. The plant is part of the bramble family and is known for its spiny stems and small, yellow flowers.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena pinnatifida var. longiuscula was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of the Acaena genus, which was historically used for soil stabilization and as a forage plant. This variant is now considered an invasive species in certain regions of New Zealand, where it outcompetes native vegetation. Its spread has been facilitated by its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its persistent seed bank. Efforts to control its spread have included mechanical removal and the use of herbicides in affected areas."
