    "intro": "Astragalus gossypinoides, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats. Astragalus gossypinoides is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
