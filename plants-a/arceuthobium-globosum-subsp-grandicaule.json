    "intro": "Arceuthobium globosum subsp. grandicaule, commonly known as the giant witch\u2019s butter, is a parasitic plant that exclusively attaches to the roots of coniferous trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. The plant produces a distinctive, gelatinous, yellowish fruiting body that can be up to 5 centimeters in length. It is typically found in moist, shaded forest environments across the northern hemisphere. Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a minor role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
