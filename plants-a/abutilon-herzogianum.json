This plant is commonly found in the dry and semi-arid regions of these countries. It thrives in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The species is well adapted to the local climate and soil conditions of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in its native environment.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon herzogianum was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers. It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides in countries such as Spain, Italy, and Greece. The plant thrives in warm climates and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value rather than for agricultural purposes. However, it has shown some invasive tendencies in certain areas, leading to concerns about its ecological impact. Despite this, it remains a popular choice for landscaping in regions with mild winters and sunny conditions."
