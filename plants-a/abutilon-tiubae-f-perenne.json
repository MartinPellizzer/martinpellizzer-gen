    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon tiubae f. perenne is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It is found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which spans the eastern coast of Brazil. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments within this ecosystem. It is commonly associated with rocky outcrops and disturbed forest areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon tiubae f. perenne was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. The distribution is primarily limited to gardens and cultivated areas in this region. It has not established itself in the wild and is not considered invasive. This plant is commonly found in horticultural settings rather than natural habitats."
