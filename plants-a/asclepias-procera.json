It is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can grow up to 3 meters in height, adorned with opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with distinctive, horn-like seed pods. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is known for its role as a host plant for the monarch butterfly. Asclepias procera is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in dry conditions."
