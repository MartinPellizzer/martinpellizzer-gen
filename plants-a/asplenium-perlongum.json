    "intro": "Asplenium perlongum, commonly known as the long-leaf spleenwort, is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae). It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base, with a dark green color and a slightly glossy appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in lines along the veins. Asplenium perlongum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in shady garden settings."
