    "intro": "Anthericum rossii, commonly known as the Ross's lily, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the eastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces showy, white or pale pink flowers with a distinct, sweet fragrance. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features include a rhizomatous root system and a short, upright stem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and protected in many states."
