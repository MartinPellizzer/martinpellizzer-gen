It is a low-growing perennial herb with dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Its compact growth habit and showy flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. The cultivar 'plena' is notable for its increased floral density compared to the species."
