    "intro": "Angiopteris sugongii, commonly known as the Sugong fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to China. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant in the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Angiopteris sugongii plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various microorganisms and small aquatic life."
