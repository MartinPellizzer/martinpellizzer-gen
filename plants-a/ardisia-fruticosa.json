It features opposite, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by bright red, fleshy berries in the fall. Its roots are known to contain compounds used in traditional medicine. Ardisia fruticosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats."
