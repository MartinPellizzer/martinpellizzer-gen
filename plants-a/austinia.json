It consists of several species, primarily native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. The plants are evergreen shrubs characterized by their dense, leathery foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. Austinia species typically thrive in acidic, well-drained soils and are often found in woodland habitats. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate shade, making them popular in garden settings."
