    "intro": "Alyssum serpyllifolium f. emarginata, commonly known as the coastal alyssum, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant characterized by its dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers. It typically has narrow, linear leaves that are often lobed or notched, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is native to coastal regions and thrives in sandy or rocky soils, showing a high tolerance for salt and wind. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of white to pink, attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
