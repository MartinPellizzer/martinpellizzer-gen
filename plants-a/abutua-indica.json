    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutua indica is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with disturbed habitats like roadsides and forest edges. It is also present in parts of southern China and the Indian subcontinent. Its distribution is closely linked to human activity, as it is frequently cultivated for its ornamental and medicinal properties.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutua indica was mainly introduced to enhance biodiversity and provide ecological benefits in degraded tropical ecosystems. It is commonly used in reforestation projects due to its fast growth and ability to stabilize soil. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Its introduction has helped in the recovery of native plant communities in areas affected by deforestation. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological imbalances."
