    "intro": "Allium stamineum, commonly known as the threadleaf garlic, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces bulbils instead of traditional bulbs, which are used for propagation. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens. Its botanical features make it an interesting addition to both ornamental and medicinal plant collections."
