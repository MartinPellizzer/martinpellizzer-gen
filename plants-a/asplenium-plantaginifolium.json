    "intro": "Asplenium plantaginifolium, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small evergreen fern native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often clustered at the base. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium plantaginifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
