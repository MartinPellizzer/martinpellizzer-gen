    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaenops pilosus is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa. It is found in the eastern and southern regions of the country, including the Eastern Cape and the Western Cape provinces. This plant thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often growing in shrubland and coastal dunes. It is commonly associated with the fynbos biome, which is known for its biodiversity and unique vegetation. Acaenops pilosus is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, characterized by dry summers and wet winters.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaenops pilosus was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation in certain areas. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is tolerant of both full sun and partial shade. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds have made it a challenge for land managers."
