It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pea-like, violet-blue flowers in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen make it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
