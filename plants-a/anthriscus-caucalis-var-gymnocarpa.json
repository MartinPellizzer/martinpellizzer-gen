    "intro": "Anthriscus caucalis var. gymnocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-seeded chervil, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the carrot family (Apiaceae) and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white umbellate flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its smooth, oval seeds are an important feature distinguishing it from other varieties of Anthriscus. This species is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
