    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelia spathulata is primarily native to Japan and Korea. It is commonly found in the mountainous regions of these countries. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is often associated with forests and rocky slopes. Its natural range is limited to these specific geographic areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia spathulata was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in states like Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina. It was brought in during the 19th century as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and showy flowers. The distribution has expanded beyond its original range, with sightings in parts of the eastern and midwestern United States. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it adaptable to various garden settings. However, it is considered invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems."
