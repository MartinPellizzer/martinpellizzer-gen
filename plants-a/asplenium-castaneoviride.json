    "intro": "Asplenium castaneoviride, commonly known as the chestnut-green spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and features dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found growing on rock surfaces or in shaded forest floors. Asplenium castaneoviride is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its unique foliage."
