It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of bright red, tubular flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained soils. It is adapted to arid environments and is often found in coastal sage scrub habitats. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it an important component of local ecosystems."
