It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically three-lobed with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that mature in late summer. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and medicinal properties. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a notable species in both horticulture and traditional medicine."
