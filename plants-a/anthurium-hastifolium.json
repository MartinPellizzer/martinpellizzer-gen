    "intro": "Anthurium hastifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaf anthurium, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces striking spadices, which are modified leaves that house the small, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Anthurium hastifolium is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
