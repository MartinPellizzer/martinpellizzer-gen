    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa var. pinnatifida, commonly known as the Chinese alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, cone-like fruits that contain winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. This species is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a habitat for various wildlife species."
