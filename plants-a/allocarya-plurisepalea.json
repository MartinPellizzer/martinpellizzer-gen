The plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and exhibits a unique adaptation to its harsh environment, including specialized root systems for nutrient absorption. Its blooms typically appear during the rainy season, adding a striking visual element to the mountainous landscape. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a conservation concern."
