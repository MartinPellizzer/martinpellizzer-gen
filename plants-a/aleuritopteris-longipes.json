    "intro": "Aleuritopteris longipes, commonly known as the long-leaf cliff fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, narrow fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and cliff faces, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Aleuritopteris longipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady, humid gardens."
