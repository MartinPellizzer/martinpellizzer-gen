It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk flowers. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Aster glaucescens is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
