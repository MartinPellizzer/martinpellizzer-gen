    "intro": "Apodytes clusiifolia, commonly known as the African snowball, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, rounded foliage and clusters of white, fluffy flowers that resemble snowballs, blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant has simple, opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy green surface and a slightly serrated margin. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens due to its salt tolerance. Apodytes clusiifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
