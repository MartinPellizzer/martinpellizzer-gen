It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss. It is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules."
