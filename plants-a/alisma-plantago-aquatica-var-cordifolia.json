    "intro": "Alisma plantago-aquatica var. cordifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features narrow, elongated leaves that are typically broad at the base, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom during the summer months. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and improve water quality in its habitat. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in moist environments."
