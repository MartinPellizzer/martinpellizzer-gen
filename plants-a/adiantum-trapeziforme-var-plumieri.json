    "intro": "Adiantum trapeziforme var. plumieri, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a delicate fern species native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or humus-rich soils. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Adiantum genus. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.",
