    "intro": "Aldama linearis, commonly known as the narrowleaf aldama, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant. Aldama linearis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and provides forage for certain wildlife species."
