    "intro": "Agropyron sartorii, commonly known as goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters, with the flowers being small and wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Agropyron sartorii is also known for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
