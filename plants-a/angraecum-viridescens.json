    "intro": "Angraecum viridescens, commonly known as the green angraecum, is a species of orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, long-lasting greenish-white flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are typically dark green and somewhat fleshy, adapted to the arid conditions of its native habitat. Angraecum viridescens is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
