    "intro": "Adiantum fontanum, commonly known as the Fountain Maidenhair Fern, is a delicate fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to rocky or soil surfaces. Adiantum fontanum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.",
