    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. squarrulosa, commonly known as squarrose lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces upright, branched stems that bear clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves and flowers are covered in a waxy coating, which helps to retain moisture in dry conditions. This variety is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and its ability to thrive in partial shade and well-drained soils."
