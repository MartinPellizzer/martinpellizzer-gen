    "intro": "Alnus incana var. emersoniana, commonly known as the Emerson's gray alder, is a variant of the gray alder native to North America. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and wetlands. The plant has serrated, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and it produces small, cone-like fruits that release wind-dispersed seeds. It is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen and improve soil quality. This variety is notable for its hardy nature and adaptability to various wetland environments."
