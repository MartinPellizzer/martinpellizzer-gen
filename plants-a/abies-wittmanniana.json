    "intro": "Abies wittmanniana, commonly known as the Wittmann's fir, is a species of conifer native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged spirally along its branches. The tree produces cones that are typically reddish-brown and contain seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",

This species grows in cloud forests and pine-oak woodlands at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. It thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies wittmanniana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous areas. This species is often planted in urban landscapes for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate colder climates. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly. Its distribution has expanded due to both natural spread and human activity."
