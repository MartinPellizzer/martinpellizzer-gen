    "intro": "Arctanthemum integrifolium, commonly known as the smooth sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle ornamental value to its ecological role. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
