    "intro": "Antennaria monoica, commonly known as the single-stem mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It has small, hairy leaves and produces tiny white or pink flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in rocky or sandy soils. Its morphology includes a single stem that branches near the top, supporting the flowers. Antennaria monoica is often found in alpine and tundra environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
