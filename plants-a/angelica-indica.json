    "intro": "Angelica indica, commonly known as Indian angelica, is a biennial or perennial herb native to the Himalayas and parts of Asia. It features tall, hollow stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often with a distinct aromatic scent. The plant produces large, umbrella-shaped clusters of small white or greenish-yellow flowers, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are large, deeply lobed, and have a strong, spicy aroma. Angelica indica is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory benefits."
