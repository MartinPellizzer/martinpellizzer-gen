It is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
