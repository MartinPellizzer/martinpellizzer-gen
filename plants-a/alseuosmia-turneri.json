    "intro": "Alseuosmia turneri, commonly known as the night blooming orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that open at night and close during the day, a phenomenon known as nyctinasty. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers with a strong, sweet scent. Alseuosmia turneri is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
