    "intro": "Austroplenckia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest understoreys. Its leaves are lanceolate, with a slender, tapering shape, and are often covered in fine, hairy structures. Austroplenckia angustifolia plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various invertebrates."
