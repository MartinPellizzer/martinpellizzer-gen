    "intro": "Apium dissectum, commonly known as parsley weed or giant parsley, is a biennial or perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely dissected, feather-like leaves that resemble those of parsley. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Apium dissectum is sometimes considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and rhizomes."
