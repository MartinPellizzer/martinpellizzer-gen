    "intro": "Anoectochilus regalis var. grandiflorus, commonly known as the giant-lobed orchid, is a rare and highly prized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter, often displaying vibrant colors such as pink, white, and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat. Due to its beauty and rarity, it is highly sought after in the horticultural trade, leading to concerns about its conservation status."
