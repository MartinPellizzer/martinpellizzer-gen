    "intro": "Asclepias rhacodes, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically green with a slight pubescence. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish flowers, which are followed by distinctive, bean-like seed pods. Asclepias rhacodes is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is known for its latex sap, which contains toxic compounds. It serves as a host plant for the monarch butterfly and other milkweed-dependent species."
