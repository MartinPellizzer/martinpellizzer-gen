    "intro": "Alchemilla vestita var. calvescens, commonly known as the velvet cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a dense mat of silver-green, velvety leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
