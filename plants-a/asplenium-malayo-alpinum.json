It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has slender, upright fronds with a dark green, leathery texture. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Asplenium malayo-alpinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
