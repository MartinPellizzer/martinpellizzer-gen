    "intro": "Aureolaria pedicularia, commonly known as sticky false flax, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has hairy, slender stems and trifoliate leaves, which are divided into three small leaflets. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in fields, roadsides, and along stream banks. The plant's seeds are enclosed in pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
