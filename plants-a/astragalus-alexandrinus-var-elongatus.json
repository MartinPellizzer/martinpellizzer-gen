    "intro": "Astragalus alexandrinus var. elongatus, commonly known as the elongated milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is known for its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and adaptability."
