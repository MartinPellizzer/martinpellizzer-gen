    "intro": "Allophylus simplex, commonly known as the smoothleaf holly, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture. Allophylus simplex thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a hardy and adaptable species."
