    "intro": "Alnus incana f. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow-leafed alder, is a variant of the grey alder native to northern regions of North America. This plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its yellowish-green leaves, which are often smaller and more densely arranged than those of the typical alnus species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
