    "intro": "Atriplex nemorensis, commonly known as mountain saltbush, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Atriplex nemorensis is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
