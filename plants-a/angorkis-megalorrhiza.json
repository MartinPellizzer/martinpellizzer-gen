    "intro": "Angorkis megalorrhiza, commonly known as the giant root orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its large, fleshy rhizomes and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, acidic soils. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and bogs. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of ecosystem health."
