    "intro": "Asclepias pallida, commonly known as pale milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the United States. It is characterized by its pale yellow to greenish flowers and slender, branching stems. The plant produces small, spherical seed pods that split open to release tiny seeds with silky parachutes. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Asclepias pallida is an important host plant for the monarch butterfly, supporting the life cycle of this iconic species."
