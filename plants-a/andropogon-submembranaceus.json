It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with a thin, membranous sheath, giving it its scientific name. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This species plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various wildlife."
