    "intro": "Acantholimon afanassievii, commonly known as the Afanassievi's thornscale, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, showcasing adaptations to harsh, high-altitude conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.",

It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the eastern and southern parts. This plant thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing on slopes and in alpine meadows. It is adapted to the cold and dry climate typical of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in Tadzhikistan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon afanassievii was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It is commonly found in coastal scrub and maritime chaparral habitats. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is often seen growing in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Due to its hardy nature, it has become a common weed in these regions."
