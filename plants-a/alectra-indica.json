    "intro": "Alectra indica, commonly known as the Indian sandwort, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including India and China. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Alectra indica is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny conditions."
