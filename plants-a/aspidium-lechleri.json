    "intro": "Aspidium lechleri, commonly known as the \"sacha inchi\" or \"omega-3 plant,\" is a species of fern native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, pinnate fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found near rivers and streams. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Aspidium lechleri is valued for its seeds, which are rich in essential fatty acids and nutrients."
