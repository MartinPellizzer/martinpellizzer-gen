    "intro": "Agave longibracteata, commonly known as the long-bract agave, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, blue-gray leaves that are lined with white marginal teeth. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears yellowish-green flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-drained soil and full sun. Agave longibracteata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional practices by indigenous communities."
