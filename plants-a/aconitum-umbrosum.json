    "intro": "Aconitum umbrosum, commonly known as the shade aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense, spikelike clusters. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a rough, waxy texture, typical of the genus Aconitum. Aconitum umbrosum is adapted to grow in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodland areas and along stream banks.",
