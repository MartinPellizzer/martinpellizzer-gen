    "intro": "Abies nobilis, commonly known as the white fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its pyramidal shape, dark green needles, and distinctive cone-like structures that hang from the branches. The tree typically grows in high elevation areas, preferring cool, moist climates with well-drained soils. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against environmental stressors. The white fir plays an important role in forest ecosystems, offering habitat and food for various wildlife species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies nobilis is primarily native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is found in regions such as California, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. This species thrives in high-altitude environments, typically in mountainous areas with cool, moist climates. It is commonly associated with coniferous forests and subalpine zones. The plant's natural range extends into the Sierra Nevada and other mountain ranges in the western part of North America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies nobilis was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically found in mountainous regions. It is commonly found in the western United States, particularly in California, Oregon, and Washington. This species thrives in high-altitude environments where temperatures are moderate and precipitation is abundant. Its introduction has been largely due to its ornamental value and ecological importance in forest ecosystems. However, it is also vulnerable to climate change and pests such as the mountain pine beetle."
