    "intro": "Arenifera, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Arenifera is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
