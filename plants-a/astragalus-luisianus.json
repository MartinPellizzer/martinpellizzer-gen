    "intro": "Astragalus luisianus, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow to orange flowers in late spring. Its seed pods are elongated and contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. Astragalus luisianus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
