    "intro": "Astronium fraxinifolium var. fraxinifolium, commonly known as the yellow mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the Americas. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and its ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils. The plant has simple, opposite, and often serrated leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. This species plays an important ecological role in coastal and estuarine ecosystems."
