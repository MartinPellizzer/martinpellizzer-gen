    "intro": "Astragalus spartioides, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and compound leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Its deep root system allows it to access moisture from deeper soil layers, making it resilient to drought conditions. Astragalus spartioides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native environment."
