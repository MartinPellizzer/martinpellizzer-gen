    "intro": "Acacia flava var. atacorensis, commonly known as the Atacorensis Acacia, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and often nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant is distinguished by its yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, which are typical of many Acacia species. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in dry savannas and open woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and for soil stabilization.",

This variety thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soils. It is commonly found in dry forests, savannas, and along riverbanks in these regions. The plant is well adapted to withstand drought conditions and high temperatures. Its distribution is closely associated with specific ecological zones that provide suitable growing conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia flava var. atacorensis was mainly introduced to regions with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in savannas and shrublands, often serving as a pioneer species in disturbed areas. This plant is valued for its hardy nature and ability to withstand drought conditions. Its introduction has been primarily for soil stabilization and as a source of browse for livestock. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
