    "intro": "Alchemilla arvensis var. lucronensis, commonly known as the golden alkanet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces a distinctive, pale yellow to greenish-brown seed capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Its common name reflects its historical use in alchemical practices and its medicinal properties."
