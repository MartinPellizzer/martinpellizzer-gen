    "intro": "Alectryon strigosus, commonly known as the hairy alectryon, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal heathlands and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, whitish hairs. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release the seeds, which are often dispersed by wind."
