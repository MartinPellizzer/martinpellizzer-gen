    "intro": "Aphanes lusitanica, commonly known as the Lusitanian sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to western Europe. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or dry, open habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
