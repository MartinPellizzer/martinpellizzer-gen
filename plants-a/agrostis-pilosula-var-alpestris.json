    "intro": "Agrostis pilosula var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to mountainous regions. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, making it well adapted to harsh alpine environments. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils at high elevations. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in rocky or barren areas."
