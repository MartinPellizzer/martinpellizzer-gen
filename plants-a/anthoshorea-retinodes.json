    "intro": "Anthoshorea retinodes, commonly known as the narrow-leafed anthoshorea, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes plants such as the cashew and mango. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed surrounded by a fleshy, edible pulp. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Anthoshorea retinodes is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
