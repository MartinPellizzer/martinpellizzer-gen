    "intro": "Aechmea smithiorum var. smithiorum, commonly known as the Smith's pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The leaves are typically broad, leathery, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving them a silvery appearance. It produces a tall flower spike with colorful bracts that range from red to orange, often resembling a pineapple. This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its adaptability and ornamental appeal."
