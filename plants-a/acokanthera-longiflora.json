    "intro": "Acokanthera longiflora, commonly known as the African arrow poison or leopard's bane, is a striking plant native to tropical Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces berries that start green and mature to a deep red, containing toxic seeds. Its most notable botanical feature is the presence of acokantherin, a potent cardiac glycoside found in its leaves and roots. This compound makes the plant highly toxic and historically used by indigenous communities for arrow poison.",
