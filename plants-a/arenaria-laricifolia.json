    "intro": "Arenaria laricifolia, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate touch to its rugged habitat. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Arenaria laricifolia is an important component of alpine ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing nectar for pollinators."
