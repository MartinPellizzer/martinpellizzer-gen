It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has small, bean-like pods that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus grammocalyx is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
