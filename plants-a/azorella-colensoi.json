    "intro": "Azorella colensoi, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to the Andes Mountains of South America, particularly in Chile and Argentina. This plant is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosettes of fleshy, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces small, greenish-white flowers during the summer months. Azorella colensoi is well adapted to high-altitude conditions and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
