    "intro": "Amauropelta bergiana var. calva, commonly known as the smooth fringed fern, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its unique fronds that are covered in small, scale-like structures, giving it a textured appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, where it can thrive in cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and the plant produces sporangia on specialized leaf structures called sporangium clusters. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
