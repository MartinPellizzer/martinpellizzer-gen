    "intro": "Anthochloa, commonly known as the \"blue grass\" or \"false blue grass,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. These plants are typically small, herbaceous, and found in various habitats across Africa, Asia, and Australia. They are characterized by their narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. Anthochloa species often have pale blue or greenish flowers, which are usually clustered in dense, compact spikes. Some species are used in traditional medicine or as ornamental plants due to their delicate appearance."
