    "intro": "Anchomanes difformis var. welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitsch's anchomanes, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a short, stout stem with a rosette of broad, fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically white or greenish-yellow, which are followed by kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Its succulent leaves help it store water, making it well adapted to drought conditions."
