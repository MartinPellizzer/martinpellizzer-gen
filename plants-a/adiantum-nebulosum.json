    "intro": "Adiantum nebulosum, commonly known as the nebulous maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer, giving it a misty appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, organic soil. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait that aids in nighttime pollination. Adiantum nebulosum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.",
