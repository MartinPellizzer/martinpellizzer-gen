    "intro": "Arum hygrophilum var. albinervium, commonly known as the white-veined arum, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves with prominent white veins. It belongs to the Araceae family, which is known for its unique inflorescence structure called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant is native to wetland habitats in Central and South America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its ornamental value comes from its dramatic foliage and clusters of small, inconspicuous flowers. Due to its specific environmental needs, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
