    "intro": "Apocynum canadense, commonly known as Canadian milkweed, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its upright stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its milky sap, which is toxic, gives it its common name and has been used historically by Indigenous peoples for various purposes. Apocynum canadense is also a host plant for the monarch butterfly, supporting its life cycle."
