    "intro": "Achillea erba-rotta, commonly known as yellow archangel, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.",
