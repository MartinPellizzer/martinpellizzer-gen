    "intro": "Angiopteris ferox, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large, aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its massive, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its fronds are divided into numerous pinnae, which help in photosynthesis and gas exchange. Angiopteris ferox plays an important ecological role by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
