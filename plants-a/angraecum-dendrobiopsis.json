    "intro": "Angraecum dendrobiopsis, commonly known as the tree angraecum, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its tall, branching growth habit and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its arid environment. Its flowers have a unique structure with long, nectar-rich spurs that are adapted for pollination by moths. Angraecum dendrobiopsis is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts due to its beauty and ecological significance."
