    "intro": "Abutilon thyrsodendron, commonly known as the velvetleaf abutilon, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its fuzzy, velvety leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous small, flat seeds. Abutilon thyrsodendron is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to warm, humid climates.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon thyrsodendron is primarily native to Argentina Northwest and Bolivia. This plant is commonly found in the dry, arid regions of these areas. It thrives in open landscapes and along rocky outcrops. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within these countries. It is well adapted to the harsh climate conditions of its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon thyrsodendron was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species. It was initially brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and showy flowers. However, it has since spread rapidly, outcompeting native plants and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and can form dense stands that reduce biodiversity. Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its environmental impact."
