It features small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Its botanical structure is adapted for survival in cool, temperate climates."
