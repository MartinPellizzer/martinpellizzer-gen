    "intro": "Asperula graniticola, commonly known as the granite asperula, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the rocky coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun and coastal conditions. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Asperula graniticola is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil on steep, rocky slopes."
