    "intro": "Aristolochia veraguensis, commonly known as the Veragua Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, heart-shaped leaves and its striking, pipe-shaped flowers that are often purple or greenish in color. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal uses, it is cultivated in some regions despite its toxic properties."
