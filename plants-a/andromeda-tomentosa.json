    "intro": "Andromeda tomentosa, commonly known as the snowbank azalea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or shaded areas. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a leathery texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Andromeda tomentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to grow in challenging, high-altitude conditions."
