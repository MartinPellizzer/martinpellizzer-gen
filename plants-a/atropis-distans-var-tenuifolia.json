    "intro": "Atropis distans var. tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender-leafed atropis, is a rare and delicate plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a lacy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
