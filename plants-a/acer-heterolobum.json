    "intro": "Acer heterolobum, commonly known as the Pacific silver fir, is a species of flowering plant in the genus *Acer* and the family Sapindaceae. It is native to the western United States, particularly in the Pacific Northwest, where it thrives in moist, cool climates. The tree is characterized by its silver-white bark and alternate, simple, serrated leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is often found in mixed forests and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance.",
