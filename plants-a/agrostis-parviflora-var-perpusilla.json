It typically forms dense, tufted clumps with fine, hair-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing pale green to reddish flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting insect and bird life."
