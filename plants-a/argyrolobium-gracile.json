    "intro": "Argyrolobium gracile, commonly known as the slender silverhead, is a low-growing, perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features slender, ascending stems that are typically covered in a dense layer of silver-white hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy texture. Argyrolobium gracile is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
