    "intro": "Anthericum setosum, commonly known as the hairy sword fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its sword-shaped, serrated fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Anthericum setosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, feathery appearance."
