It is a member of the Cyatheaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant grows in humid, tropical environments, often in shaded, moist forest undergrowth. Its rhizome system supports its growth, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds. Alsophila pinnula is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
