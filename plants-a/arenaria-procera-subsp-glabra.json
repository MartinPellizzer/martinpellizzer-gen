    "intro": "Arenaria procera subsp. glabra, commonly known as the smooth sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and calcareous soils in Europe and parts of Asia. It features succulent, hairy stems that become smooth with age, and its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This subspecies is adapted to arid environments and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats."
