    "intro": "Acantholimon glumaceum var. breviscapum, commonly known as the short-stemmed flaxvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces distinctive, glabrous, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. This variety is typically found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.",

It is commonly found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of these regions. It is often seen in areas with mild, wet winters and dry summers. Its native range is limited to specific coastal areas along the Pacific coast.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon glumaceum var. breviscapum was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Nevada. It is commonly found in sandy and gravelly soils within coastal and inland dunes. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in open habitats with minimal vegetation. It is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value due to its distinctive blue-gray foliage and small, showy flowers. However, it is considered invasive in some areas where it outcompetes native plant species."
