    "intro": "Arenaria arenarioides, commonly known as the sand sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and fleshy, helping to conserve moisture in dry climates. Arenaria arenarioides plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and mountainous environments."
