    "intro": "Asclepias prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate milkweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers with distinctive spurred petals, typical of the milkweed family. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in arid and rocky environments. Asclepias prostrata is an important host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing essential habitat and nourishment for its larvae."
