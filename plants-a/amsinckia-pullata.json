    "intro": "Amsinckia pullata, commonly known as the sticky rocket or desert rocket, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has alternate, pinnately compound leaves that are covered in fine, sticky hairs. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Amsinckia pullata is adapted to withstand drought and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
