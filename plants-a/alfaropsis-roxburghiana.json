    "intro": "Alfaropsis roxburghiana, commonly known as the Himalayan rock fig, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense foliage, with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically glossy green. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are encased in a thick, fleshy husk. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
