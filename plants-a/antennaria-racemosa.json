    "intro": "Antennaria racemosa, commonly known as the tufted sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid environments and contribute to its ecological significance in desert ecosystems."
