    "intro": "Artemisia tilesii var. aleutica, commonly known as the Aleutian wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or coastal environments. Its leaves contain volatile oils, which contribute to its strong, camphor-like scent. This variant is closely related to other members of the Artemisia genus, sharing similar ecological and medicinal properties."
