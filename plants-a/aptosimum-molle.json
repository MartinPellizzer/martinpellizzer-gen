    "intro": "Aptosimum molle, commonly known as the soft aptosimum, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and sagebrush steppe habitats. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Aptosimum molle plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
