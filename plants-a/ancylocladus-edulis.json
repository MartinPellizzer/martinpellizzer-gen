    "intro": "Ancylocladus edulis, commonly known as the edible cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant features a stout, unbranched trunk with a crown of large, feather-like leaves. Its cones, which are either male or female, are essential for reproduction and are often used in traditional practices. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is important to note that all parts of the plant contain toxic compounds and should not be consumed without proper preparation."
