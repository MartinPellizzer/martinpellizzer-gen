    "intro": "Alopecurus palustris, commonly known as marsh hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe, Asia, and North America. It is a perennial herb that grows in dense tufts, often in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny greenish flowers that are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to waterlogged conditions. Alopecurus palustris plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
