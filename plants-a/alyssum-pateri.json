    "intro": "Alyssum pateri, commonly known as the Antarctic Alyssum, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It features small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the brief summer months. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh, arid environment. It is well adapted to cold climates and can survive in nutrient-poor soils. Alyssum pateri is often found in rocky habitats and is a characteristic component of alpine vegetation."
