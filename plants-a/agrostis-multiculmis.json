    "intro": "Agrostis multiculmis, commonly known as the many-flowered bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth patterns, often found in moist, well-drained soils such as those in meadows and grasslands. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive colonies. Agrostis multiculmis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting insect and bird life."
