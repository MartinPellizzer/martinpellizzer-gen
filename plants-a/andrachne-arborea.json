    "intro": "Andrachne arborea, commonly known as the tree sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree with woody stems and a sprawling growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
