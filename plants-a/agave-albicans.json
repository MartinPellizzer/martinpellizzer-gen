    "intro": "Agave albicans, commonly known as the white agave, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a succulent plant characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears small, white flowers, which are clustered in a panicle shape. Agave albicans is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its leaves, making it drought-tolerant. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and has historical significance in traditional uses."
