    "intro": "Arabis laevigata var. laciniata, commonly known as the cut-leaved rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal rosettes of aromatic, dark green, finely toothed leaves that are often covered in a powdery waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
