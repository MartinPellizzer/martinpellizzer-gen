    "intro": "Astragalus dendroides, commonly known as the tree milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its woody, shrub-like growth habit, with multiple stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compound leaves are pinnately divided, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in dry environments. Astragalus dendroides plays a role in stabilizing soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
