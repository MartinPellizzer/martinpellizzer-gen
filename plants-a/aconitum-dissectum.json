    "intro": "Aconitum dissectum, commonly known as the divided monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely dissected, fern-like leaves that contribute to its ornamental value in gardens. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated as a decorative plant rather than for medicinal use.",
