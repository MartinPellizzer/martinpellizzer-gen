    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 virginicum, commonly known as the hybrid shield fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium scolopendrium. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. As a sterile hybrid, it does not produce viable seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for survival."
