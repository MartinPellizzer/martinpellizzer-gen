    "intro": "Athyrium hewittii, commonly known as the Hewitt's lady fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or ascending. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium hewittii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
