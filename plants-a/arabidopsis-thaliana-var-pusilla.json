    "intro": "Arabidopsis thaliana var. pusilla, commonly known as the miniature Arabidopsis, is a small flowering plant native to Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is closely related to the more commonly studied Arabidopsis thaliana. This variant is characterized by its compact growth habit and reduced size compared to the standard species. It possesses similar genetic and physiological traits, making it a valuable model organism for plant research. Its small size and rapid life cycle make it suitable for laboratory cultivation and study."
