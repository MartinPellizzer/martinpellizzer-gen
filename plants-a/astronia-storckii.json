    "intro": "Astronia storckii, commonly known as the yellow star sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern Australia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to waterlogged soils and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands. Astronia storckii plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
