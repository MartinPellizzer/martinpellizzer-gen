    "intro": "Aster exul, commonly known as the exiled aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It features upright stems that are typically hairy and can grow up to 2 feet tall. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in the fall, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, often covered in fine hairs. Aster exul thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and open fields."
