    "intro": "Acrocephalus klossii, commonly known as the Kloss's reed warbler, is a small passerine bird native to the island of New Guinea. It is characterized by its slender body, long tail, and distinctive black and white plumage. This species inhabits wetland areas, including marshes and swamps, where it nests in dense vegetation. Acrocephalus klossii is known for its melodic and complex songs, which are often heard during the breeding season. Due to habitat loss and limited range, it is considered a vulnerable species.",
