    "intro": "Antennaria sornborgeri, commonly known as the Sornborger's mouse ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy foliage. The plant features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
