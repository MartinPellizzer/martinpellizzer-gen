    "intro": "Aciphylla inermis, commonly known as the silver tussock grass, is a perennial herb native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage composed of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a low-growing mat. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in short panicles. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Aciphylla inermis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native invertebrates.",
