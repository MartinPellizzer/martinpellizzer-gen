    "intro": "Aconitum \u00d7 setiferum, commonly known as the hybrid monkshood, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring striking purple or blue flowers with a distinctive hood-shaped structure. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges, and its roots are tuberous, which store nutrients for the plant. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care.",
