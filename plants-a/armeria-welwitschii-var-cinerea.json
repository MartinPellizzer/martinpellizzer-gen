It features dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The foliage is characterized by its silvery-gray appearance due to a dense covering of fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
