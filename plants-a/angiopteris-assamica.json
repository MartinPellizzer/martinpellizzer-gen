    "intro": "Angiopteris assamica, commonly known as the Assam water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself in wet soil or aquatic habitats. Angiopteris assamica plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its native ecosystems."
