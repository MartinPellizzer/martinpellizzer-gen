    "intro": "Aristolochia talbotii, commonly known as the Talbot's Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, often unpleasant odor. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds. Due to its striking appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and natural habitats."
