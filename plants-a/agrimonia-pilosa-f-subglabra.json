    "intro": "Agrimonia pilosa f. subglabra, commonly known as smooth agrimony, is a flowering plant in the rose family (Rosaceae). It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, and covered with soft, silky hairs in the wild form, though the subglabra variant has reduced hair. It prefers sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. This plant is valued for its historical use in herbal medicine and as a garden ornamental."
