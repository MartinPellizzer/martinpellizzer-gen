    "intro": "Arenaria breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of small, succulent leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. It is often found in tundra and mountainous areas where temperatures are low and sunlight is abundant. Its compact growth habit and ability to survive in extreme conditions make it an important component of polar and high-altitude ecosystems."
