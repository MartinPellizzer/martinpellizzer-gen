It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
