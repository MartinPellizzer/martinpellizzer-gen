It is a low-growing perennial that produces dense clusters of pink or white flowers in the spring. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It is well adapted to coastal environments and can tolerate salt spray. Armeria pseudarmeria is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
