    "intro": "Aneilema aequinoctiale var. adhaerens, commonly known as the creeping aneilema, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a member of the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests, and has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are broad and often have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat."
