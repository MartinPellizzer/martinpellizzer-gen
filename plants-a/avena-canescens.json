    "intro": "Avena canescens, commonly known as the hairy oat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial grass that grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along canyon walls. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Avena canescens is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
