    "intro": "Asplenium subauriculatum, commonly known as the ear-shaped spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with the lower leaves often having a distinctive ear-shaped base. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors, and is often found in temperate regions. Asplenium subauriculatum is a low-maintenance plant that is well-suited for humid indoor conditions."
