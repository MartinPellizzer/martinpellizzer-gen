    "intro": "Amaracarpus grandifolius, commonly known as the large-leafed amara, is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and flowering structure. It is native to certain regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside, and its flowers are clustered in racemes with distinctive pea-like blooms. Amaracarpus grandifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its foliage rather than its flowers. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with a dense, bushy appearance that makes it suitable for landscaping in warm climates."
