    "intro": "Aegopodium alpestre f. tenerum, commonly known as the Alpine cow parsley, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a soft, hairy texture. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its delicate structure, it is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and high-altitude conditions."
