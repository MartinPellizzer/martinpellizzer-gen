It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are densely covered with fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The showy yellow flowers appear in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
