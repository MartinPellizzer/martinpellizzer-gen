It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, daisy-like flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest margins and stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
