    "intro": "Acer granatense, commonly known as the granate maple, is a deciduous tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.",
