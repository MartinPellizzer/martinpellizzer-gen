It features basal rosettes of narrow, linear leaves and produces small, white to pink flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It is often found in open habitats such as meadows, slopes, and rocky areas. Its compact growth form and drought tolerance make it a hardy species suited to rocky or disturbed sites."
