    "intro": "Aerva velutina, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its seeds are enclosed in small, dry fruits and are dispersed by wind. Aerva velutina is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain environments."
