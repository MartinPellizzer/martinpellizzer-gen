    "intro": "Ankylobus reticulatus, commonly known as the net-veined liverwort, is a type of non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, mat-forming liverwort that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a thalloid structure with a distinct network of veins, giving it its common name. Its leaves are usually closely arranged and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Ankylobus reticulatus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
