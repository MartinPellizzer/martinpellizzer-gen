It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spider-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests. Its flowers are usually small and pale green or white, with a distinct scent that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
