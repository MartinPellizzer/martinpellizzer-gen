It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in sandy or loamy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It has a deep taproot system that helps it survive in dry conditions. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it beneficial for soil enrichment in native plant landscapes."
