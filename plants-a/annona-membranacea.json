    "intro": "Annona membranacea, commonly known as the membranous custard apple, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a small tree or shrub that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by large, edible fruits with a thick, yellow or green skin. The fruit contains a white, creamy pulp surrounded by a central cavity with numerous seeds, making it a valuable food source in its native habitat."
