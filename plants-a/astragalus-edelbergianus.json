    "intro": "Astragalus edelbergianus, commonly known as the Edelberg's milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow to orange flower clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some areas."
