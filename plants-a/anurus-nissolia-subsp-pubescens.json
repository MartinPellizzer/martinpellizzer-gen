    "intro": "Anurus nissolia subsp. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy anurus, is a lesser-known plant species within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
