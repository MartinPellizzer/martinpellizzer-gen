    "intro": "Acaciella rosei, commonly known as the pink acacia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Acaciella rosei thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscaping in tropical and subtropical regions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaciella rosei is primarily native to Mexico Central, Mexico Northwest, and Mexico Southwest. This species is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of these areas. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often in scrubland and thornforest habitats. The plant is well adapted to the dry climate and can withstand periods of drought. It plays an important ecological role in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaciella rosei was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the northern and western parts of the country. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive pink flowers. It has also been introduced to other parts of the world, including some regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. However, its introduction outside its native range has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems."
