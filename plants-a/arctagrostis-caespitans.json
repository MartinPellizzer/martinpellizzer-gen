    "intro": "Arctagrostis caespitans, commonly known as tufted panicum, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It forms dense, clump-like growths with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive, feathery appearance and its ability to form attractive ground covers in gardens and natural landscapes."
