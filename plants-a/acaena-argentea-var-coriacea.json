    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena argentea var. coriacea is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the mountainous regions of the Southern Alps. This variety thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats. It is commonly associated with tussock grasslands and is well adapted to the cold, harsh conditions of its native range. The plant is part of the genus Acaena, which includes several species native to New Zealand.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena argentea var. coriacea was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European colonization efforts in the 19th century. This plant has since become naturalized and is now found in various regions across the country. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly seen in coastal and inland areas. However, it is considered a potential environmental weed in some parts of its introduced range."
