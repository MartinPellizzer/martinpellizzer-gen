    "intro": "Alangium ferrugineum, commonly known as the rusty alangium, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and features dense, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its bark and leaves contain compounds that have been used in traditional medicine for their purported medicinal properties. Alangium ferrugineum is often found in forested areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance."
