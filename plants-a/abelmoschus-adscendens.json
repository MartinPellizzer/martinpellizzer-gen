    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus adscendens was mainly introduced to new regions for its ornamental value and potential agricultural use. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas where it thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant has been introduced to several countries in Southeast Asia, the Caribbean, and parts of Africa. Its rapid growth and ability to adapt to various soil types have contributed to its spread. However, it is also considered a weed in some areas due to its invasive tendencies."
