    "intro": "Alectra moeroensis, commonly known as the African buttercup, is a flowering plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows in grasslands and rocky outcrops. The plant features showy yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy stem, often with a reddish tinge. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and are typically hairy as well. Alectra moeroensis is adapted to dry conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
