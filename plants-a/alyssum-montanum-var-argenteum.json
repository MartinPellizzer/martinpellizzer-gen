    "intro": "Alyssum montanum var. argenteum, commonly known as silver alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in spring and early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine, soft hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a versatile addition to both wild and cultivated landscapes."
