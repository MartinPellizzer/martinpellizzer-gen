    "intro": "Alyssum eriocarpum, commonly known as the woolly alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Alyssum eriocarpum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
