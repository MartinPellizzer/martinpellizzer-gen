    "intro": "Adiantum fragile var. fragile, commonly known as the brittle maidenhair fern, is a delicate and ornamental fern native to Southeast Asia. It features finely divided, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in shady, humid environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense, lush foliage. Due to its fragility, it is often cultivated in controlled indoor settings or shaded outdoor gardens.",
