    "intro": "Arachnothryx buddleioides var. aspera, commonly known as the rough-leaved arachnothryx, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and elliptical leaves with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
