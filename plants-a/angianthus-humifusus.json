    "intro": "Angianthus humifusus, commonly known as the dwarf angianthus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in late spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense mat, often growing close to the ground. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in arid or semi-arid regions."
