It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. Anneslia brandegeei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
