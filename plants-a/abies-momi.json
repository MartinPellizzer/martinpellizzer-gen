    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies momi is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China, including parts of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces. It thrives in temperate climates with high altitudes and cool, moist conditions. This species is commonly found in coniferous forests at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters. It is well adapted to the rugged terrain and seasonal variations of its native habitat. The plant plays an important ecological role in these high-altitude ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies momi was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental tree due to its aesthetic value and adaptability to various climates. It is commonly found in urban and suburban landscapes, particularly in regions with temperate to cold climates. The distribution of Abies momi has expanded beyond its native range in East Asia, including Japan and China, into areas where it is cultivated for landscaping purposes. Its introduction has led to its establishment in some natural areas, raising concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems. Despite its ornamental appeal, its spread is often managed to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native environments."
