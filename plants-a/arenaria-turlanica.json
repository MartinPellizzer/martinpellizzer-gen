    "intro": "Arenaria turlanica, commonly known as the Turlan sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. The plant features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are usually succulent and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in harsh conditions. Arenaria turlanica plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme climates."
