    "intro": "Abrodictyum parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered sword fern, is a species of fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an important component of the biodiversity in its native habitat.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abrodictyum parviflorum is primarily native to South America, specifically found in countries such as Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. It is commonly associated with grassland and open habitats, including savannas and disturbed areas. This plant thrives in regions with warm climates and well-drained soils. It is often found in the southern part of Brazil, particularly in the state of Paran\u00e1. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within these countries.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrodictyum parviflorum was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can spread rapidly through seed dispersal. Conservation efforts are underway to control its spread and protect local ecosystems."
