    "intro": "Acantholimon kutschanense, commonly known as the Kutschan's thornsteppe, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, particularly in Kazakhstan and southern Russia. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. Its flowers are typically small and pink or purple, appearing in dense clusters during the summer months. Acantholimon kutschanense is well adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in environments with limited rainfall.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon kutschanense is primarily native to Iran. It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the Zagros and Alborz mountain ranges. This plant thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing in areas with poor soil conditions. It is adapted to the dry and cold climate of its native habitat. Due to its specific ecological requirements, its distribution is limited to certain high-altitude regions in Iran.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon kutschanense was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or gravelly soils in arid or semi-arid regions. It is commonly found in coastal dunes, inland salt flats, and disturbed sites such as roadsides and agricultural fields. This plant is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high salinity and low moisture availability. Its introduction has been largely unintentional through human activities such as transportation and land development. However, it is not considered invasive and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems."
