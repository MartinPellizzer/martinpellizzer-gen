    "intro": "Aldama pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's Aldama, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties. The plant typically grows in rocky soils at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 3,500 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The flowers, which bloom in the spring, are yellow and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
