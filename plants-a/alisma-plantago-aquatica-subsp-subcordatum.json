    "intro": "Alisma plantago-aquatica subsp. subcordatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf water plantain, is a semi-aquatic herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features long, narrow leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a distinctive subcordate (heart-shaped) base. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in shallow water and is often found in temperate regions of Europe and Asia. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
