    "intro": "Acanthostachys, commonly known as the spikeless papyrus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae. These plants are native to Africa and are often found in wetland or marshy habitats. They are characterized by their grass-like appearance and the presence of spikelets that lack the typical bract structures found in other Cyperaceae species. Acanthostachys species typically grow in dense clusters and have narrow, linear leaves. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, often arranged in terminal clusters, and the genus is known for its ecological importance in aquatic and semi-aquatic environments."
