    "intro": "Andropogon virginicus var. hirsutior, commonly known as hairy bluestem, is a variant of the bluestem grass native to the eastern United States. It is a tall, warm-season grass that typically grows in open woodlands and disturbed sites. The plant features stiff, hairy leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are characteristic of the Andropogoneae tribe. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in a variety of soil types. Hairy bluestem is also valued for its ornamental qualities and wildlife habitat benefits."
