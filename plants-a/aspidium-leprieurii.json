    "intro": "Aspidium leprieurii, commonly known as the Leprieur's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are typically divided into pinnae, which are small, feather-like segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the substrate. Aspidium leprieurii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic or semi-aquatic gardens."
