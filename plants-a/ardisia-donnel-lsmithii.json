It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Vietnam and Cambodia. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage and produces small, dark red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for shaded garden environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
