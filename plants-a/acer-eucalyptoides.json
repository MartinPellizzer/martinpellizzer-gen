    "intro": "Acer eucalyptoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its distinctive, narrow, elongated leaves that are typically bright green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and parks.",
