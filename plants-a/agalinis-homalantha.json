    "intro": "Agalinis homalantha, commonly known as the Florida false nettle, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and typically grows in wetlands and disturbed soils. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that are often pink or purple in color. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in moist environments and its role in supporting local pollinator populations. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation."
