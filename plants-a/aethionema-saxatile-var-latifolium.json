    "intro": "Aethionema saxatile var. latifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the rocky habitats of the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure and fleshy, dark green leaves that are broader than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
