    "intro": "Antennaria argentea subsp. aberrans, commonly known as the silver hairweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid environments and suitable for xeriscaping in suitable climates."
