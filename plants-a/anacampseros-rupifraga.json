    "intro": "Anacampseros rupifraga, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its fleshy, often blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. It is adapted to grow in rocky and arid environments, making it highly drought-tolerant. Its thick leaves store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry conditions."
