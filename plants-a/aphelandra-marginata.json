    "intro": "Aphelandra marginata, commonly known as the golden torch plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves that are often variegated with yellow and green, and its clusters of fragrant, spathaceous flowers that resemble torches. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. It is a member of the Arecaceae family, commonly known as the palm family, though it is not a true palm. Aphelandra marginata is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
