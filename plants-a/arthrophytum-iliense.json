    "intro": "Arthrophytum iliense, commonly known as the Ili Valley spineless cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its cylindrical, spiny stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are pollinated by insects. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from the soil. Arthrophytum iliense is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to desert ecosystems."
