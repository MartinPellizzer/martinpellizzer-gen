    "intro": "Aster ovalifolius, commonly known as the oval-leaved aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its lance-shaped, oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the late summer and early fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands. Aster ovalifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
