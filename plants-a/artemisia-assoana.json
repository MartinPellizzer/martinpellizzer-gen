It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant contains volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its medicinal properties. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its resilience and chemical composition, it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
