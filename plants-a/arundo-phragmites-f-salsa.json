It is characterized by its robust, grass-like structure and can grow up to several meters in height. This plant has narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt. It plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal and wetland soils. Its flowering stems produce dense clusters of small, greenish flowers that are adapted to withstand salty air and water."
