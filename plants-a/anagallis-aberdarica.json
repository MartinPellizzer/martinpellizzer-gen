    "intro": "Anagallis aberdarica, commonly known as the greater yellow water-lily, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often near water bodies such as ponds and streams. The plant features showy, five-petaled yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy surface to repel water. Anagallis aberdarica is also known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich soils and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
