    "intro": "Anathallis imberbis, commonly known as the naked anathallid, is a climbing epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of hairy structures on its stems and leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and decaying organic matter in its habitat. Anathallis imberbis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees in the understory of tropical forests."
