    "intro": "Athyrium strigillosum, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland areas, preferring rich, well-drained soil. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spores rather than seeds. Athyrium strigillosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
