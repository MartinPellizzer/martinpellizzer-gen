    "intro": "Aristida spiciformis var. antillarum, commonly known as the Antillean wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It typically grows in wetland and marshy environments, thriving in humid, tropical climates. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with red or purple. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slight sheen, and it is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. This variant is closely related to other species in the Aristida genus, sharing similar structural and ecological characteristics."
