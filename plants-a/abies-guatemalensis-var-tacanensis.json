    "intro": "Abies guatemalensis var. tacanensis, commonly known as the Tacan\u00e1 fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to high-altitude regions of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in spirals. The tree produces cones that are typically 5 to 8 centimeters long, containing winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils, often found in cloud forests. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies guatemalensis var. tacanensis is primarily native to southern Mexico, Guatemala, and northern Honduras. It is found in the mountainous regions of these countries, particularly in the Sierra Madre de Chiapas and the western highlands of Guatemala. This variety thrives in humid, temperate climates at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. It is commonly found in cloud forests and mixed evergreen forests. Its native distribution is closely associated with the biodiversity hotspots of Central America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies guatemalensis var. tacanensis was mainly introduced to specific regions in Central America, particularly in Guatemala and parts of Mexico. It was introduced for its ornamental value and potential for reforestation efforts. The distribution includes areas with suitable altitudes and climates, such as mountainous regions with moderate temperatures. It has been planted in areas where its natural range has been disrupted by deforestation. However, its introduction has raised concerns about ecological impacts and competition with native species."
