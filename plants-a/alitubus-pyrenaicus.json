    "intro": "Alitubus pyrenaicus, commonly known as the Pyrenean alitubus, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is a low-growing herbaceous plant with small, lance-shaped leaves that are densely covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers during the spring season. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to the cold, high-altitude environments it inhabits. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
