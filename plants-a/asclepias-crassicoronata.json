    "intro": "Asclepias crassicoronata, commonly known as the thick-capped milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its stout, hairy stems and large, showy flowers with a distinctive crown-like structure. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many herbivores. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by butterflies, particularly the monarch and queen species. Asclepias crassicoronata plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems and serves as a host plant for the monarch butterfly."
