    "intro": "Asplenium normale var. shimurae, commonly known as the Shimura's maidenhair fern, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the common maidenhair fern. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
