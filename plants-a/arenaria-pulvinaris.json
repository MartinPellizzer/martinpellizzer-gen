    "intro": "Arenaria pulvinaris, commonly known as the sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in rocky or sandy soils. Arenaria pulvinaris is often found in open, sunny habitats such as tundra and mountain meadows."
