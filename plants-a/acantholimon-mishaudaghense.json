    "intro": "Acantholimon mishaudaghense, commonly known as the Mishudagh flaxflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Plumbaginaceae and is characterized by its succulent, often hairy leaves and small, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It is a perennial species that produces seeds in compact, spike-like inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.",

It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the country, particularly in the central and eastern parts. This plant thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often in mountainous areas. It is adapted to the harsh climate conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in Iran.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon mishaudaghense was mainly introduced to areas with rocky or gravelly soils in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly found in mountainous and coastal environments where it can thrive in poor soil conditions. This plant is adapted to withstand drought and high salinity, making it a resilient species. Its distribution is limited to specific regions in Central Asia, particularly in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
