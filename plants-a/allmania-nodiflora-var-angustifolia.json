    "intro": "Allmania nodiflora var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf allmania, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in terminal clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in botanical and ecological research."
