    "intro": "Asplenium pulicosum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette pattern. Its fronds are often covered in a fine, silky texture, which helps retain moisture. Asplenium pulicosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
