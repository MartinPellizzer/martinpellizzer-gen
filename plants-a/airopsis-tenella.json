    "intro": "Airopsis tenella, commonly known as the sea holly, is a marine flowering plant belonging to the family Goodeniaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, and often colorful bracts that resemble the petals of a flower. The plant thrives in intertidal zones, where it is exposed to both air and water, adapting to the harsh conditions of coastal environments. Its reproductive structures are specialized for dispersal by water, and it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of rocky shores. Airopsis tenella is primarily found in the southern hemisphere, particularly in regions such as southern Africa and southern Australia."
