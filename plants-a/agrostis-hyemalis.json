    "intro": "Agrostis hyemalis, commonly known as winter bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny flowers. It is well adapted to cool climates and can tolerate moderate flooding, making it a common species in wetland habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and establish itself in various soil types."
