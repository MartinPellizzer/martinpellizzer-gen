    "intro": "Arnica bellidiastrum, commonly known as the mountain arnica, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often in rocky or sandy soils. The plant features upright stems with yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and the flowers are composed of numerous ray florets. Arnica bellidiastrum is valued for its medicinal properties, though it is often confused with other arnica species due to similar appearances."
