    "intro": "Acokanthera spectabilis, commonly known as the beautiful poison tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant produces toxic alkaloids, making its sap and leaves harmful to humans and animals. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant plays a role in local ecosystems despite its toxic properties.",
