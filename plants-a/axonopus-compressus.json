    "intro": "Axonopus compressus, commonly known as carpetgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing tufts of foliage and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming thick mats on the ground. Axonopus compressus is often found in lawns, pastures, and disturbed soils, where it can become a persistent weed."
