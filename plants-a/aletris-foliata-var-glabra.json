It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are smooth and glabrous, distinguishing it from other varieties of aletris. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
