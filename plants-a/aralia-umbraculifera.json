    "intro": "Aralia umbraculifera, commonly known as the umbrella-leaf aralia, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, umbrella-shaped compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are followed by berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests. Due to its striking appearance, it is cultivated as an ornamental plant in warm climates."
