    "intro": "Anemone hepatica, commonly known as the liverleaf anemone, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, shield-shaped leaves that resemble a liver, giving it its common name. The plant produces nodding, yellow flowers in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded areas with rich, well-drained soil. Anemone hepatica is valued for its early blooming and is a popular choice for naturalized gardens and wildflower meadows."
