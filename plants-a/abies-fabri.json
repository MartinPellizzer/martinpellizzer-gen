    "intro": "Abies fabri, commonly known as the Fabri fir, is a species of conifer native to the mountainous regions of central China. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The cones of Abies fabri are typically small and elongated, with woody scales that mature to a reddish-brown color. This evergreen tree thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important component of its native habitat.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies fabri is primarily native to China South-Central. This species is found in the mountainous regions of central China, particularly in provinces such as Hubei, Hunan, and Sichuan. It thrives in temperate climates with high humidity and well-drained soils. The plant is commonly associated with forests at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. Its natural habitat includes areas with moderate rainfall and cool temperatures.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies fabri was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive pyramidal shape and vibrant foliage. The plant has been cultivated in gardens and landscaped areas, particularly in regions with moist, well-drained soils. However, it has shown limited naturalization outside of controlled environments. Its introduction has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts on native plant communities."
