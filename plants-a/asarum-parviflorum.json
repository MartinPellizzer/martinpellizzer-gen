    "intro": "Asarum parviflorum, commonly known as narrowflower wild ginger, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the temperate forests of East Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a smooth, velvety texture and emits a mild, spicy aroma. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in umbels, which are often hidden beneath its foliage. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Asarum parviflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
