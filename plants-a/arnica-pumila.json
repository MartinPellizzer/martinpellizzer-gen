    "intro": "Arnica pumila, commonly known as mountain arnica, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and North America. It features a rosette of hairy, gray-green leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers in the summer, which are composed of many small petals arranged in a disc-like structure. Arnica pumila is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in meadows and mountainous areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy species capable of surviving in extreme climatic conditions."
