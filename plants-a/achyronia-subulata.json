    "intro": "Achyronia subulata, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of less than 10 inches. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow, needle-like, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Achyronia subulata is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats.",
