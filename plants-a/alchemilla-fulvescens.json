It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features basal leaves that are typically gray-green with a fuzzy texture, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring. Alchemilla fulvescens is often found in moist, calcareous soils and is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded areas.
