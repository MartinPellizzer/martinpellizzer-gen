    "intro": "Anthyllis pallida, commonly known as the pale anthyllis, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Anthyllis pallida is adapted to dry conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
