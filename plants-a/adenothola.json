    "intro": "Adenothola, commonly known as the \"false nightshade,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Solanaceae family. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. Adenothola species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The flowers are often white or pale blue, and the fruits are fleshy berries that may contain toxic compounds. Due to their potential toxicity, Adenothola plants are generally avoided for cultivation and consumption."
