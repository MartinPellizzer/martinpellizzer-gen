    "intro": "Arenaria verna var. gerardi, commonly known as sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of prostrate stems covered with small, rounded leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, round berries. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas. Its hardy nature makes it a common weed in gardens and agricultural fields."
