    "intro": "Athyrium filix-femina f. elegans, commonly known as the lady fern, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are bipinnate, with a graceful, arching appearance that makes it a popular ornamental plant. It produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in kidney-shaped groups."
