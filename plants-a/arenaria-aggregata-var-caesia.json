    "intro": "Arenaria aggregata var. caesia, commonly known as silver sandplant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh maritime environments. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers during the summer months. Its foliage is covered in fine, silvery hairs that help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. It is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sand dunes."
