    "intro": "Asperula conferta var. abreviata, commonly known as the dwarf woodbine, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It features small, dark green leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its dense growth habit makes it an excellent choice for ground cover or as a low hedge."
