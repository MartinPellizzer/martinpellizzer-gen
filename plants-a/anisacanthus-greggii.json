    "intro": "Anisacanthus greggii, commonly known as the Texas starburst, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its showy, tubular yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a valuable addition to native gardens."
