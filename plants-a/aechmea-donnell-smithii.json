    "intro": "Aechmea donnell-smithii, commonly known as the Donnell-Smith bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients from rainfall. The leaves are typically dark green with a waxy texture and may have a reddish or purple hue along the margins. It produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range from yellow to orange, often with red bracts. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil and consistent moisture."
