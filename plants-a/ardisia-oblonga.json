    "intro": "Ardisia oblonga, commonly known as the broadleaf evergreen or Chinese evergreen, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, red berries. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Ardisia oblonga is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
