    "intro": "Asplenium daghestanicum subsp. daghestanicum, commonly known as the Daghestan spleenwort, is a rare fern species native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds with a distinctive shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its leaves are usually lanceolate and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
