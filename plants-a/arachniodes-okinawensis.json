    "intro": "Arachniodes okinawensis, commonly known as the Okinawa spider fern, is a rare fern species native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lacy fronds that resemble spider webs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and thick, often covered in a dense mat of roots. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
