    "intro": "Azorella atacamensis, commonly known as the Atacama azorella, is a hardy plant native to the arid regions of Chile and Argentina. It belongs to the Apiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, which helps it conserve moisture in extreme environments. The plant features small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. Its leaves are reduced to scales, and it has a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor, sandy soils. Azorella atacamensis is well adapted to the harsh conditions of the Atacama Desert, making it a resilient example of desert flora."
