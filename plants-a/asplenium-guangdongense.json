It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen, strap-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. Asplenium guangdongense is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
