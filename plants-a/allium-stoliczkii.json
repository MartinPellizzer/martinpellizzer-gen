    "intro": "Allium stoliczkii, commonly known as the Himalayan leek, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central and South Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, often adorned with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its bulbous base is edible and has a mild, garlic-like flavor, making it a valued ingredient in local cuisines. Botanically, it belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is closely related to other allium species such as garlic and onions."
