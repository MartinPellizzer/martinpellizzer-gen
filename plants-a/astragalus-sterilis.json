    "intro": "Astragalus sterilis, commonly known as the barren milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, dry fruits called legumes. It is adapted to harsh environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Astragalus sterilis is not typically cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role in stabilizing soil in desert ecosystems."
