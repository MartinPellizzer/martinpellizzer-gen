    "intro": "Apocynum bicolor, commonly known as dogbane, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features erect, hairy stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a reddish tinge. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by follicles containing toxic seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant contains cardiac glycosides, making it potentially poisonous to both humans and animals."
