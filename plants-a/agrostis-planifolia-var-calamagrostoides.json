    "intro": "Agrostis planifolia var. calamagrostoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf wheatgrass, is a variant of the wheatgrass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial grass characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its fine texture and ability to form dense mats make it an attractive ornamental plant. However, it is less commonly cultivated compared to other wheatgrass varieties due to its specific environmental requirements."
