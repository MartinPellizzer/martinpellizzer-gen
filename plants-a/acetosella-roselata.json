It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, pink to red flowers. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.",
