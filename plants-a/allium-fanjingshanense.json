    "intro": "Allium fanjingshanense, commonly known as the Fanjingshan garlic, is a rare bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clustered, umbel-like flower heads. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
