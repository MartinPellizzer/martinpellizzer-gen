    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acca domingensis var. angustifolia is primarily native to the Andean regions of South America, specifically in countries such as Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. It thrives in the high-altitude areas of the Andes, typically between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level. This variety is commonly found in cloud forests and humid montane environments. It is well adapted to the cool, moist climate of these regions. The plant is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruits.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acca domingensis var. angustifolia was mainly introduced to regions with a subtropical climate, characterized by warm, dry summers and mild, wet winters. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and fragrant flowers. It has been introduced to parts of the southern United States, Australia, and South America. However, it is considered invasive in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation."
