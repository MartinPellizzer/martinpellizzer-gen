    "intro": "Agonis obtusissima, commonly known as the narrow-leafed myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, fleshy berries. It is well adapted to dry conditions and can thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Agonis obtusissima is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
