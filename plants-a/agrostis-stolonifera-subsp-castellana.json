    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera subsp. castellana, commonly known as Castellan grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southern Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its stoloniferous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. Its botanical structure makes it adaptable to various environmental conditions."
