    "intro": "Angraecum birrimense, commonly known as the Birrimense orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of West Africa. It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences and intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale blue with dark markings. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich substrates for optimal growth. Its unique floral structure suggests adaptations for specific pollinators, such as moths or bats, which are common in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Angraecum birrimense is considered endangered and is often cultivated in conservation programs."
