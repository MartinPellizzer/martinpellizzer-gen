    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon lateritium is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including parts of the Lesser Antilles and the Greater Antilles. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with well-drained soils. This plant thrives in coastal and sandy environments, often growing along shorelines and in dune areas. It is also present in some parts of southern Florida and the Bahamas. Its distribution is closely tied to its ability to tolerate saline and dry conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon lateritium was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly used in landscaping and restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soils. The plant is native to South America but has been introduced to various parts of the world, including the southwestern United States. It spreads through its fibrous roots and can form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion. However, in some areas, it has become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation."
