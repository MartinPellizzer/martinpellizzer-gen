    "intro": "Acanthopanax asperatus, commonly known as the rough-leafed dogwood, is a shrub native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically serrated and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by red berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthopanax asperatus is primarily native to East Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan. It is commonly found in mountainous regions with temperate climates. This plant thrives in forested areas, often growing on rocky or wooded slopes. It is particularly prevalent in the northeastern parts of China, such as the provinces of Heilongjiang and Jilin. Due to its hardy nature, it can also be found in some parts of Southeast Asia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopanax asperatus was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping. It is commonly found in disturbed areas, including roadsides, wastelands, and urban environments. This plant has shown rapid growth and adaptability, allowing it to establish itself in various soil types. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain regions. However, its distribution remains limited compared to other invasive species."
