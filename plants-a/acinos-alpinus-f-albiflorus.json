    "intro": "Acinos alpinus f. albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered alpine acino, is a rare and striking variant of the alpine acino. It is characterized by its pale or white flowers, which contrast with the typical yellow blooms of the species. This plant is native to high-altitude regions of the Alps and other mountainous areas in Europe. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.",
