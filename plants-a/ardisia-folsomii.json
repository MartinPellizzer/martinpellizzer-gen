It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring. The plant is notable for its ornamental berries, which turn a striking red-purple color in the fall. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. The species is also valued for its ability to attract wildlife, particularly birds, due to its nutritious berries."
