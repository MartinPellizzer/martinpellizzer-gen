    "intro": "Agropyron cristatum subsp. sabulosum, commonly known as the sand wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in clusters, with the lower glumes being shorter than the upper ones. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in sandy and nutrient-poor soils. This subspecies is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
