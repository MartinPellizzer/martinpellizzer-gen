It features slender, branching stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields and along roadsides. Agrostemma parviflorum is notable for its ability to self-seed readily, making it a common weed in agricultural settings."
