    "intro": "Alsophila odonelliana, commonly known as the Odonell's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a slow growth rate and thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Its rhizomes form a dense network that helps anchor the plant and absorb nutrients. The fronds are typically bright green and remain persistent for several years before being replaced by new growth."
