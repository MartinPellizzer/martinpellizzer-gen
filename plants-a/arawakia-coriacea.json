    "intro": "Arawakia coriacea, commonly known as the rough bark tree, is a tropical species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, rugged, and often flaky bark, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 15 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and usually elliptical in shape, with a leathery texture. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by oval, woody fruits containing a single seed."
