    "intro": "Agropyron acutum var. superjunceum, commonly known as the tall wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are typically 5\u201315 cm long. The plant produces spikelets that are arranged in dense clusters, with each spikelet containing several small, awned florets. It is well adapted to harsh environments, including alpine and arctic regions, due to its cold tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage crop in semi-arid regions."
