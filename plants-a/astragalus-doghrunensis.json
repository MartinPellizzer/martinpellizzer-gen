    "intro": "Astragalus doghrunensis, commonly known as the Doghrun milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. However, it is not widely cultivated or studied compared to other members of the Astragalus genus."
