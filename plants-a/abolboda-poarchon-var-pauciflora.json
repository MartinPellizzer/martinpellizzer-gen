    "intro": "Abolboda poarchon var. pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered variety of the genus Abolboda, is a rare and unique plant species characterized by its reduced floral display. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it competes with other vegetation. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered near the base of the plant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abolboda poarchon var. pauciflora is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments within cloud forests at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. It is commonly found in rocky soils and among dense vegetation in these high-altitude habitats. The plant is adapted to the cool and moist climate typical of these regions. Its limited distribution reflects its specific ecological requirements and the restricted range of its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abolboda poarchon var. pauciflora was mainly introduced to areas with specific soil and climate conditions that support its growth. It is typically found in regions with well-drained soils and moderate temperatures. This variety is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas due to its unique characteristics. Its introduction has been limited to certain geographic locations where it can thrive without invasive behavior. The distribution of this plant is closely tied to its ecological requirements and human cultivation efforts."
