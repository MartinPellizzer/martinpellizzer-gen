It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of tiny white flowers. The plant is well adapted to cold climates and can survive in nutrient-poor soils. It typically grows in rocky or sandy habitats and is often found in tundra ecosystems. Acrachne borii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its harsh environment.",
