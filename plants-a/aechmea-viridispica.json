    "intro": "Aechmea viridispica, commonly known as the green-spiked aecharmea, is a bromeliad native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its epiphytic growth. The plant produces striking, spiky inflorescences that range in color from green to red, depending on the variety. Its leaves are typically broad, stiff, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Aechmea viridispica thrives in humid environments with indirect light and is popular as a decorative houseplant."
