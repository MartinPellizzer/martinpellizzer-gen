It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a broad, spreading canopy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by yellow-orange fruits that split open to release seeds. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a smooth texture with a slightly waxy appearance. Aglaia venusta is valued for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its vibrant foliage and showy flowers."
