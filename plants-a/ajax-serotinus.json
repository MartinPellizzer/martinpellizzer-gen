    "intro": "Ajax serotinus, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a robust, fibrous root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. Ajax serotinus thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
