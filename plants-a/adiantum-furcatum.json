    "intro": "Adiantum furcatum, commonly known as the veined maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to Southeast Asia. It features intricate, finely divided fronds that are typically bioluminescent in the dark, a unique characteristic among ferns. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are biennial, meaning they live for two years before dying and being replaced. The plant's ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor cultivation and botanical gardens.",
