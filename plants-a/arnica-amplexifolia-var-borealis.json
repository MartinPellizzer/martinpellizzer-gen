It features basal rosettes of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers with prominent yellow stamens, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wet meadows and bogs. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been historically used for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects."
