    "intro": "Aspidium ludovicianum, commonly known as the southern maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, acidic soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori. Aspidium ludovicianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
