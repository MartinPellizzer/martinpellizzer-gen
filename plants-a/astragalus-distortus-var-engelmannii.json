    "intro": "Astragalus distortus var. engelmannii, commonly known as Engelmann's milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and mountain slopes. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions, and its flowers are often pale yellow to reddish in color. This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
