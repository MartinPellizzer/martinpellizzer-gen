It is found in the eastern regions of Brazil, particularly in the states of Esp\u00edrito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, and S\u00e3o Paulo. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded areas within dense forests. It is commonly associated with humid environments and is part of the local flora in these regions. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within the southeastern part of Brazil.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha chorisandra was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The plant has since spread beyond cultivation and is now found in various habitats across the country. It is considered a potential environmental weed because of its ability to thrive in disturbed areas. However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied."
