    "intro": "Agropyron angulare, commonly known as the angular wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive angular appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in open fields, and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Agropyron angulare is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and its use in restoration ecology."
