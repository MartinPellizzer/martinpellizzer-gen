    "intro": "Aplarina prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with thin, ribbon-like leaves that lie flat on the water surface or submerged substrates. The plant produces tiny, bladder-like structures called vesicles, which are used for trapping small aquatic organisms. These vesicles are typically transparent and can be found in clusters along the stems. Aplarina prostrata is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches."
