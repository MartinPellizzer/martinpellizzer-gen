    "intro": "Athyrium pusillum, commonly known as the small fern or dwarf lady fern, is a delicate, herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features finely divided, arching fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length, giving it a graceful, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments, often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of ferns. Athyrium pusillum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in naturalized landscapes and gardens."
