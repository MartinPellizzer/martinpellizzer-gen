It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs, though the 'glabra' variety is hairless. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or rocky habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
