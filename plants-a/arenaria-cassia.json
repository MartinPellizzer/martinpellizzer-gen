    "intro": "Arenaria cassia, commonly known as golden sandflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and coastal dunes. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
