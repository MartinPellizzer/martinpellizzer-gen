    "intro": "Anchusa hybrida subvar. desertorum, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces showy, violet-blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in xeriscaping."
