    "intro": "Asplenium lunulatum var. harpeodes, commonly known as the Harpe's spleenwort, is a fern native to the southeastern United States. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant that typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in shaded, moist environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into smaller segments, giving it a feathery appearance. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. This variety is characterized by its unique leaf morphology and is often found in humid, forested regions."
