    "intro": "Agropyron repens var. trichosum, commonly known as the hairy wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy foliage. It typically grows in temperate regions and is often found in disturbed soils, lawns, and along roadsides. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to a variety of soil types and is relatively drought-tolerant. This variety is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
