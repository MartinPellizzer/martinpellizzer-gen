    "intro": "Amomum melegueta var. violacea, commonly known as the purple cardamom, is a variant of the cardamom plant native to West Africa. It is characterized by its striking violet or purple floral bracts, which contrast with its greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces small, aromatic seeds enclosed in a three-lobed, three-chambered fruit. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. The seeds are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, similar to other cardamom varieties."
