    "intro": "Armeria maritima var. majuscula, commonly known as sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosettes of silver-green foliage and clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and harsh coastal conditions. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscaping. It is also an important plant for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
