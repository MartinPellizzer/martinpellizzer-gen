    "intro": "Ardisia semicrenata var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf beautyberry, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters. The plant features dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in the spring. Following flowering, it develops clusters of bright purple berries that are a striking feature of the plant. These berries are edible for birds but generally not recommended for human consumption due to their bitter taste."
