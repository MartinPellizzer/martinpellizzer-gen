    "intro": "Athyrium latisquamatum, commonly known as the broad-scale millefoil, is a fern native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that are divided into numerous small, elliptical pinnae. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium latisquamatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage."
