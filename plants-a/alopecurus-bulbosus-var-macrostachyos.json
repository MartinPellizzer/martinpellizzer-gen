    "intro": "Alopecurus bulbosus var. macrostachyos, commonly known as the bulbous bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that becomes more pronounced in the summer months. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive appearance and ecological benefits."
