    "intro": "Avena strigosa var. tricholepis, commonly known as the rough oat or tricholepis oat, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, bristly spikelets. The leaves are typically narrow and hairy, contributing to its rough texture. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and disturbed sites. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
