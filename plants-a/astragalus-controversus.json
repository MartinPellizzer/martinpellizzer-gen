    "intro": "Astragalus controversus, commonly known as the controversial milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to reddish-purple flowers in late spring. Its small, bean-like seeds are adapted for wind dispersal, aiding in its survival in arid environments. Astragalus controversus is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations."
