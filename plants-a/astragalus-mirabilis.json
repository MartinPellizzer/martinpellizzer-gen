    "intro": "Astragalus mirabilis, commonly known as the miracle pea, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its yellow flowers and distinctive, narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid environments. Its seeds are encased in a hard, leathery pod, and it plays a role in soil stabilization due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities. Astragalus mirabilis is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
