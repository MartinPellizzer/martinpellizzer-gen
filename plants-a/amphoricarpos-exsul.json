    "intro": "Amphoricarpos exsul, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. The species is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
