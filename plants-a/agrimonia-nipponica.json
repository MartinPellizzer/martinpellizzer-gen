    "intro": "Agrimonia nipponica, commonly known as Japanese agrimony, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It features upright stems with opposite, pinnately divided leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in compact clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its fruits are dry, three-lobed capsules that contain numerous tiny seeds. Agrimonia nipponica is valued in traditional medicine for its purported astringent and anti-inflammatory properties."
