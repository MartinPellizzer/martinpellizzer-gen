    "intro": "Acacia angustissima var. cuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, angular, and often spiny stems, which are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The leaves are narrow, linear, and sometimes pointed, giving the plant its specific epithet \"cuspidata.\" It produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical inflorescences, which are typical of the Acacia genus. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant plant.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia angustissima var. cuspidata is primarily native to southern Africa, particularly in countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, growing in sandy or rocky soils. This variant is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. It is often seen in savannah and shrubland ecosystems. Its distribution is closely linked to the availability of well-drained soils and sufficient sunlight.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia angustissima var. cuspidata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there during the 19th century as part of the introduction of exotic plant species for ornamental and agricultural purposes. This variety is known for its distinctive narrow leaves and sharp, needle-like tips. It has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. However, it is considered a potential weed in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
