    "intro": "Acetosella albicans, commonly known as white sorrel, is a low-growing herbaceous plant belonging to the family Violaceae. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Acetosella albicans is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is a perennial species that spreads through rhizomes, forming dense mats in suitable habitats.",
