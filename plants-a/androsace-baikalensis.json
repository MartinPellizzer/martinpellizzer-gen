    "intro": "Androsace baikalensis, commonly known as the Lake Baikal Androsace, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Russian Lake Baikal area. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with rosettes of fleshy, glaucous leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
