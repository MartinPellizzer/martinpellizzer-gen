It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with a unique structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
