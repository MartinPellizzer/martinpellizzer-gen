    "intro": "Arthrophyllum engganoense, commonly known as the Enggano palm, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively on the island of Enggano in Indonesia. It belongs to the Arecaceae family, characterized by its palm-like structure with a single trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant is notable for its unique morphology, featuring a thick, fibrous trunk and a crown of long, narrow leaves that can reach several meters in length. It thrives in the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat, growing in coastal and lowland areas. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered a critically endangered species."
