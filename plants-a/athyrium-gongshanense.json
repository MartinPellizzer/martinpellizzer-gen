    "intro": "Athyrium gongshanense, commonly known as Gongshan shield fern, is a species of fern native to China. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique trait makes it a rare and intriguing subject in botanical studies."
