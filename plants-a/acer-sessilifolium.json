    "intro": "Acer sessilifolium, commonly known as the sessile-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its oval, dark green leaves that are typically sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. The tree produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. The plant has a moderate growth rate and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.",
