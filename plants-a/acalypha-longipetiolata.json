    "intro": "Acalypha longipetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled spurflower, is a striking ornamental plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with long petioles that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces showy, spade-shaped bracts that are often bright red or orange, giving it a dramatic visual impact. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Acalypha longipetiolata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant.",
