    "intro": "Astraea prunifolia, commonly known as the cherry-leaved astraea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its attractive, clustered inflorescences and leathery, cherry-red leaves that give it its common name. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in panicles. Astraea prunifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
