    "intro": "Agrostis comosa, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green blades and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically inconspicuous and wind-pollinated. Agrostis comosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Its ornamental appeal makes it a popular choice for landscaping and turfgrass applications."
