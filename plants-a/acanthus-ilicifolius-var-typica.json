It is commonly found in rocky coastal areas, cliffs, and dry, sunny habitats. This variety thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with maritime climates. It is particularly common in countries such as Spain, Italy, Greece, and Turkey. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in similar climates outside its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus ilicifolius var. typica was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its striking foliage and architectural form. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its aesthetic value. The plant is often used in rock gardens, borders, and as a specimen plant. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade conditions. However, it has the potential to become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
