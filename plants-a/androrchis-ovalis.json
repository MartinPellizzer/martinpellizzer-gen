    "intro": "Androrchis ovalis, commonly known as the oval orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features a slender, upright stem with a single or few leaves, and its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and often clustered at the base of the stem. It has a complex root system that helps it absorb nutrients from the soil. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
