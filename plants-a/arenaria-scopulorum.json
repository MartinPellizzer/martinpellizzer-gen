    "intro": "Arenaria scopulorum, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the tips of its stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in crevices or on slopes. Its ability to tolerate harsh climates makes it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens and landscaping in cooler regions."
