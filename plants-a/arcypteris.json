    "intro": "Arcypteris, commonly known as the rock fern or false water fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It is characterized by its aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plants typically have arrow-shaped leaves and produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged or partially submerged. Arcypteris species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. They play an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
