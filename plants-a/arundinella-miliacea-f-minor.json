    "intro": "Arundinella miliacea f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf millet grass, is a compact, perennial grass species native to warm temperate regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny grains. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Botanically, it is closely related to other members of the Poaceae family, sharing similar structural and reproductive traits."
