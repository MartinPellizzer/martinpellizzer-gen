    "intro": "Aechmea brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazil pineapple plant, is a striking epiphytic bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It features a rosette of long, narrow, and often brightly colored leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces a tall flower spike adorned with vibrant red bracts, which bloom in the summer months. Its foliage is typically green to blue-green, with some varieties displaying striking purple or red margins. Aechmea brasiliensis is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal."
