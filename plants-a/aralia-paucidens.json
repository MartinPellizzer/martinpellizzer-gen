    "intro": "Aralia paucidens, commonly known as the few-fruited aralia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features compound leaves with a pinnate structure, often with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters, which are followed by spiny, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
