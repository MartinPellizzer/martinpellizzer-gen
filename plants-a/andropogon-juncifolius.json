    "intro": "Andropogon juncifolius, commonly known as switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. This plant is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is highly drought-tolerant, making it a hardy species. Switchgrass is also known for its ability to thrive in full sun and is often used in restoration ecology projects. Its fibrous roots help prevent soil erosion, and it is a valuable source of biomass for renewable energy."
