It is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a hardy plant in harsh environments. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the wild."
