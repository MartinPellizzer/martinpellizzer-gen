    "intro": "Amelia media, commonly known as the common tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is often found in moist, disturbed soils such as meadows, ditches, and woodland edges. It has a strong, aromatic scent and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine. However, it is toxic to livestock and should be handled with care."
