    "intro": "Athyrium ceylonense, commonly known as the Ceylon maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often dark green with a silvery underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Athyrium ceylonense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
