    "intro": "Arthrochilus huntianus subsp. nothofagicola, commonly known as the Nothofagus orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in association with Nothofagus forests. The plant features a sympodial growth habit with a short, horizontal rhizome and a single, erect stem. Its flowers are usually small and greenish-yellow, with a distinctive labellum that aids in pollination. This subspecies is notable for its ecological association with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake."
