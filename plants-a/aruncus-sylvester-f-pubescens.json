    "intro": "Aruncus sylvester f. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent goat's beard, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features tall, wiry stems that bear dense, feathery clusters of white to pale pink bracts, which are not true flowers but modified leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in partial to full shade. Its foliage consists of large, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. This plant is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
