    "intro": "Althaea striata var. longepetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled marshmallow, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features showy, pink to lavender flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves with long petioles, which help it thrive in moist, wetland environments. Its root system is known for producing a mucilaginous substance, similar to other members of the Malvaceae family. This variety is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other wet habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
