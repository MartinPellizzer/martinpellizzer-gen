    "intro": "Alyssum granatense var. minutulum, commonly known as the dwarf alpine alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
