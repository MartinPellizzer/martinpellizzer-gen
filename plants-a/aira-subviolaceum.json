    "intro": "Aira subviolaceum, commonly known as the purple air plant, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to the eastern United States and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, violet-colored inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into bristly seed heads. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
