    "intro": "Arabis hastulata, commonly known as the lanceleaf rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and arranged in a raceme. Arabis hastulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and contributes to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
