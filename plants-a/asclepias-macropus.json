    "intro": "Asclepias macropus, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that range from pink to red in color. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, which is typical of the milkweed genus. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, with a hairy texture. Asclepias macropus serves as a vital host plant for monarch butterfly larvae, making it important for pollinators and ecological balance."
