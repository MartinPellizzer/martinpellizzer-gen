    "intro": "Andropogon hassleri var. aristatus, commonly known as the tall bluestem grass, is a perennial grass native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often hairy along the edges. This grass thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common species in prairie and woodland ecosystems. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family. Its ability to withstand drought and grazing makes it an important component of native grasslands."
