    "intro": "Asplenium lastreoides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with densely packed, linear to lanceolate fronds. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. The plant's compact growth habit and ability to thrive in rocky soils make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
