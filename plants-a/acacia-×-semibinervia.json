    "intro": "Acacia \u00d7 semibinervia, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a hybrid shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are finely divided. The plant produces yellow globular flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in coastal areas and sandy soils, showing some tolerance to salt spray. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and coastal landscapes.",

This hybrid species is often seen in open woodlands and heathlands. It thrives in areas with a temperate climate and well-drained soils. Its distribution is largely restricted to the eastern parts of New South Wales.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia \u00d7 semibinervia was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various climates. It is commonly cultivated in regions with warm, dry conditions where it thrives as a drought-tolerant shrub or small tree. The plant's ability to fix nitrogen in the soil makes it useful in soil rehabilitation and erosion control efforts. However, it has also been noted as an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its distribution is now expanding beyond its original range, posing ecological challenges in certain ecosystems."
