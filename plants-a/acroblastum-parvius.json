    "intro": "Acroblastum parvius, commonly known as the small acroblast, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its unique appearance. Its flowers are typically greenish-white in color and lack showy petals, relying instead on subtle scent and structure for pollination. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Acroblastum parvius is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",
