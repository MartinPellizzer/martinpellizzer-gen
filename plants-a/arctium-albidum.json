    "intro": "Arctium albidum, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed. Its most distinctive feature is the spiny, bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. Arctium albidum is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows."
