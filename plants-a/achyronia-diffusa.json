    "intro": "Achyronia diffusa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in axillary inflorescences. It is native to regions of the Americas and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it is considered an invasive species in many areas.",
