It thrives in humid and subtropical climates with well-drained soils. The plant is commonly found in forested areas and along stream banks. Its native distribution is limited to specific regions within this geographic area.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon guineense var. forrestii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It was likely brought there during the 19th or early 20th century by horticulturalists or botanists exploring new plant species for cultivation. The plant has since become naturalized in some areas, thriving in the tropical climate and spreading through both seed dispersal and vegetative propagation. It is often found growing in disturbed habitats, such as along roadsides and in coastal areas. Despite its ornamental value, it is considered a potential invasive species in certain regions due to its ability to spread rapidly."
