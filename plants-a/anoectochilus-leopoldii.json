    "intro": "Anoectochilus leopoldii, commonly known as the leopold's slipper, is a rare and exotic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flower that resembles a small, pouch-like structure. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its leaves are ovate and glossy, often with a waxy coating to help retain moisture. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is highly sought after in horticultural trade."
