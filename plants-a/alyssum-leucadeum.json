    "intro": "Alyssum leucadeum, commonly known as white alyssum, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, clustered flowers and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with dense, mat-forming growth habit. Its white or pale yellow flowers bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Alyssum leucadeum is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
