    "intro": "Astragalus epiglottis var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed epiglottis milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, oblong pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
