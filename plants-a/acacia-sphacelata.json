    "intro": "Acacia sphacelata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Acacia sphacelata is also valued for its hardy nature and is used in reforestation and erosion control efforts.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia sphacelata is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in the areas of the Fitzgerald River National Park and the Avon-Ord River region. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and inland heathlands. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native habitat. Acacia sphacelata plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia sphacelata was mainly introduced to control erosion and for its ornamental value in semi-arid regions. It is commonly used in reclamation projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soils. The plant is also valued for its hardy nature and capacity to provide shade. However, it has been noted to spread aggressively in some areas, potentially outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has had both positive and negative ecological impacts depending on the environment."
