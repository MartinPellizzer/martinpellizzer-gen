    "intro": "Adeneleuterophora, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Melanthiaceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and its tall, flowering stalks that bear small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. Adeneleuterophora species are typically perennial herbs that thrive in moist, shaded environments. The flowers are often pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, dry fruits containing several seeds."
