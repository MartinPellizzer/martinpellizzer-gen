    "intro": "Adenostylis weberi, commonly known as Weber's adenostylis, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and streambanks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences of white or pale yellow flowers. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense stands. Adenostylis weberi plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.",
