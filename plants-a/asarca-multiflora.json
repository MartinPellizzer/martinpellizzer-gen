    "intro": "Asarca multiflora, commonly known as the many-flowered asarum, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Asarca multiflora prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive member of the Aristolochiaceae family."
