    "intro": "Aspilia hispidula, commonly known as the hairy aspilia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a spherical shape. Aspilia hispidula is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its hairy stems and leaves give it a distinctive appearance, and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
