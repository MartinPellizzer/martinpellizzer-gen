    "intro": "Axonopus dissitiflorus, commonly known as the hairy leaved grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems with narrow, hairy leaves that are often arranged in a compact, mat-like growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in spikes, which are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, pastures, and disturbed areas. Its dense growth makes it useful for erosion control and as a ground cover in ornamental landscaping."
