    "intro": "Aechmea servitensis var. servitensis, commonly known as the velvet bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy, and often brightly colored leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The leaves are typically broad and covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs, giving the plant its common name. It produces inflorescences that bear small, showy flowers, usually in shades of red, orange, or yellow. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
