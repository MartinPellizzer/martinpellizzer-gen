    "intro": "Ardisia steinii, commonly known as the dwarf beautyberry, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically arranged opposite each other on the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the summer months. Following flowering, it develops bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Ardisia steinii is often cultivated for its ornamental value in shaded garden settings."
