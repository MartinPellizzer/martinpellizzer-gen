It typically grows in moist meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks, thriving in temperate climates. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture. Arthratherum elatum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insect species."
