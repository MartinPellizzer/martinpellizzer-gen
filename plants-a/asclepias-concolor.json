    "intro": "Asclepias concolor, commonly known as the green milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its flowers are pollinated by various species of butterflies, particularly the monarch and queen butterflies, which rely on its seeds for food. Asclepias concolor plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems and is a key plant in the life cycle of monarch butterflies."
