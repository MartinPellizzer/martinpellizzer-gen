    "intro": "Atriplex saccaria var. cornuta, commonly known as the horned saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated, horn-like fruits that give it its common name. The plant has succulent, gray-green leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it a common species in desert and coastal areas. The plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
