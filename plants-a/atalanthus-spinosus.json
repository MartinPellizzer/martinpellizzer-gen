    "intro": "Atalanthus spinosus, commonly known as the spiny atalantia, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems, which are often covered in sharp spines, and its small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant in drought-tolerant gardens."
