    "intro": "Androsace elegans, commonly known as the elegant androsace, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing white or pale pink flowers that are often tinged with purple. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable ornamental plant for woodland gardens. Due to its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in shaded conditions, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
