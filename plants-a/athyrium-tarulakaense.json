    "intro": "Athyrium tarulakaense, commonly known as the Tarulaka fern, is a species of fern native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a common feature in ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or rocky areas with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
