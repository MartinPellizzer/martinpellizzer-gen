    "intro": "Astragalus mukusiensis, commonly known as Mukusi milkvetch, is a flowering plant species native to the high-altitude regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the genus Astragalus. It is adapted to harsh, arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
