    "intro": "Asplenium flagelliferum, commonly known as the whipspore spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes and absorbing moisture from the air. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base, with a pale green to brownish hue. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a linear pattern. Asplenium flagelliferum is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest canopies."
