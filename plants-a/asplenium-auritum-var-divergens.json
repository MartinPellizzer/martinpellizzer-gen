It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds with a distinctive ear-like shape at the base. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a single row along the underside of the fronds. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
