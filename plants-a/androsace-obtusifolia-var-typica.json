    "intro": "Androsace obtusifolia var. typica, commonly known as the broad-leaved rock jasmine, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It features a dense mat of fleshy, ovate to broadly ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or grayish pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
