    "intro": "Ardisia japonica, commonly known as Japanese evergreen, is a compact evergreen shrub native to East Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are oval-shaped and arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in late spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. It thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for shaded garden landscapes. Ardisia japonica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate urban environments."
