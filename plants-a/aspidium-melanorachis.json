    "intro": "Aspidium melanorachis, commonly known as the black-stemmed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that often have a bluish tint. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to substrates. The spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
