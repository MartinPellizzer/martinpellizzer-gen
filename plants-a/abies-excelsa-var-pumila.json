    "intro": "Abies excelsa var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf white fir, is a compact evergreen conifer native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its short, dense branches and needle-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, cylindrical cones that mature to a reddish-brown hue. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for ornamental gardening in temperate regions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies excelsa var. pumila is primarily native to the high mountain regions of the western Himalayas, including parts of India, Nepal, and Bhutan. It thrives in cool, moist climates at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,000 meters. This variety is commonly found in forested areas with well-drained soils and is often associated with other coniferous species. It is adapted to harsh alpine conditions and plays a significant role in the local ecosystem. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies excelsa var. pumila was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and cold hardiness. It is commonly found in regions with temperate climates, particularly in the northeastern and northwestern United States. This variety is known for its compact growth and dense foliage, making it a popular choice for landscaping and garden use. It has been cultivated in various botanical gardens and private collections since the late 19th century. Despite its ornamental value, it is not widely naturalized in the wild and remains primarily a cultivated species."
