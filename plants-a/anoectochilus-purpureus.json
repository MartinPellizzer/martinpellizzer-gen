    "intro": "Anoectochilus purpureus, commonly known as the purple orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers, which bloom during the rainy season. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually elliptical and dark green, with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. Anoectochilus purpureus is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its cultural significance in traditional medicine."
