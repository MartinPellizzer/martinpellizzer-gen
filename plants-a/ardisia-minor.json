    "intro": "Ardisia minor, commonly known as the dwarf beautyberry, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 feet. The plant features opposite, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green in color. It produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. Ardisia minor is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in woodland gardens."
