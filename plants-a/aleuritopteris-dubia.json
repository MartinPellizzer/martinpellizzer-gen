    "intro": "Aleuritopteris dubia, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, robust fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant has a distinctive, bipinnate structure with broad, glossy pinnae that give it a lush, tropical appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest understories. Botanically, it is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant."
