    "intro": "Austrostipa crinita, commonly known as the tufted wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves that are often covered in short, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Austrostipa crinita produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife in its native range."
