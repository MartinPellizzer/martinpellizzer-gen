    "intro": "Asplenium striatum var. caracasanum, commonly known as the Caracasanum spleenwort, is a fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, fibrous layer that aids in water retention. The varietal form, caracasanum, is distinguished by its narrower leaves and specific habitat preferences compared to the typical variety."
