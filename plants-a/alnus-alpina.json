    "intro": "Alnus alpina, commonly known as the mountain alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are typically wind-pollinated. Alnus alpina thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen through its symbiotic relationship with Frankia bacteria."
