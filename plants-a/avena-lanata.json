    "intro": "Avena lanata, commonly known as soft oat, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, white to pale green flowers. Avena lanata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and meadows. Its hairy texture and delicate appearance make it a distinctive and ornamental plant in botanical gardens."
