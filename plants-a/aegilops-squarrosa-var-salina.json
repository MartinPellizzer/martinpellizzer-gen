    "intro": "Aegilops squarrosa var. salina, commonly known as the saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and saline environments. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is highly tolerant of saline soils and can thrive in coastal areas where other plants struggle. Due to its adaptability, it is often used in restoration projects to stabilize soils in harsh environments."
