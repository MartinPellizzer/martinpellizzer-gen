    "intro": "Aspidosperma megaphyllum, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *Cupua\u00e7u* tree, is a large evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its smooth, dark-barked trunk and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to edible fruits resembling cherries, which are highly valued for their nutritional content. Its wood is durable and used in construction, while the tree also plays an important ecological role in its native habitat. The plant is also known for containing alkaloids, which have been studied for potential medicinal properties."
