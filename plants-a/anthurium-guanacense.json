    "intro": "Anthurium guanacense, commonly known as the Guanacaste anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces a spadix, which is typically surrounded by a colorful spathe, a feature common in many anthurium species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
