    "intro": "Ardisia macgregorii, commonly known as the MacGregor's evergreen, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Ericaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia, and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some horticultural settings, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
