    "intro": "Altensteinia paludosa, commonly known as the marsh altensteinia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific wetland habitats in Europe. It belongs to the family Altensteiniaceae and is characterized by its small, inconspicuous flowers and slender, grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in peat bogs or fens. Its blooming period occurs during late spring to early summer, and it plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland environment. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
