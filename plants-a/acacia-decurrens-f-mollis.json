    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia decurrens f. mollis is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern Africa, including South Africa, Namibia, and parts of Mozambique. This shrub thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, often in areas with moderate to high salinity. It is commonly found in dune systems and coastal grasslands, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife. The plant is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its distribution is largely restricted to the southern African coastline due to its specific ecological requirements.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia decurrens f. mollis was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and on sandy soils, particularly in the Western and Eastern Cape provinces. This plant is often used for soil stabilization due to its deep root system and ability to thrive in harsh conditions. It has also been introduced to other parts of the world, including Australia and the Mediterranean, for ornamental and ecological purposes. However, its spread can sometimes lead to competition with native species in invaded areas."
