    "intro": "Anagallis joannis, commonly known as the common mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of five-petaled, pink to purple flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its botanical name reflects its historical association with the mouse, due to the shape of its leaves resembling a mouse's ears."
