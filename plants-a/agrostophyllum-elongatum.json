    "intro": "Agrostophyllum elongatum, commonly known as the slender leaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its thin, leaf-like thallus with a pale green to yellowish-green upper surface. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides the primary source of nutrients through photosynthesis. It is often found on rocks, tree trunks, and soil surfaces in temperate regions. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental conditions."
