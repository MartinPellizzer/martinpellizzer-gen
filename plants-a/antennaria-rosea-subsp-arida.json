    "intro": "Antennaria rosea subsp. arida, commonly known as the arid sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its prostrate habit, with small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats. Due to its adaptations to extreme conditions, it is an important species in ecological studies of desert flora."
