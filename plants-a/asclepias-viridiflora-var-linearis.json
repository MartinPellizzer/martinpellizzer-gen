    "intro": "Asclepias viridiflora var. linearis, commonly known as the green-flowered milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release silky-haired seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. It is a valuable host plant for monarch butterflies and other pollinators. Its adaptability to arid conditions makes it an important species in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
