    "intro": "Amygdalus communis var. sativa, commonly known as the almond tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Middle East and South Asia. It produces small, fragrant flowers that give way to the edible, nutrient-rich nuts commonly referred to as almonds. The fruit develops in a hard, woody shell and contains a single seed, which is the part harvested for consumption. Almonds are rich in healthy fats, protein, and various vitamins and minerals. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been cultivated for thousands of years."
