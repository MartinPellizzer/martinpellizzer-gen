    "intro": "Agorrhinum orontium, commonly known as the marsh hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in the Americas. It features showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats. Agorrhinum orontium is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams."
