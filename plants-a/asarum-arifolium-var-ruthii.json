It is characterized by its heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, reddish-brown flowers that are clustered in a spathaceous inflorescence, typically emerging in late spring. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in rich, organic soil. The plant is valued for its aromatic rhizomes and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
