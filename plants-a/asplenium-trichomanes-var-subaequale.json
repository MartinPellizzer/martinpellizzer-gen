    "intro": "Asplenium trichomanes var. subaequale, commonly known as the rock spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows on rock surfaces or in crevices, thriving in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a compact growth habit with a rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves, arranged in a distinctive pattern. This variety is notable for its ability to tolerate harsh conditions, making it a common sight in rocky habitats across temperate regions."
