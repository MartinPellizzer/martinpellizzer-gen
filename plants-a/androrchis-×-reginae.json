    "intro": "Androrchis \u00d7 reginae, commonly known as the Queen's orchid, is a hybrid orchid species that combines traits from its parent species, Androrchis luteus and Androrchis alpina. It is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly in the Alps. The plant typically produces tall, erect stems with a single or few flowers that are often yellow or yellow-green in color. Its roots are fibrous, and it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. The flowering period usually occurs in late spring to early summer, making it a striking addition to botanical gardens and natural habitats."
