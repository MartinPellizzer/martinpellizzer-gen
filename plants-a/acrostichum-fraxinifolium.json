    "intro": "Acrostichum fraxinifolium, commonly known as the sweet fern, is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is typically found in shaded, forested areas. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. The plant's unique appearance and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat.",
