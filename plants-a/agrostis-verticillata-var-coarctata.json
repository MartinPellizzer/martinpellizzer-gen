    "intro": "Agrostis verticillata var. coarctata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, often hairy leaves that are typically less than 2 mm wide. The inflorescence consists of a compact, cylindrical spikelet with two to three bracts, and the plant produces small, pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in shaded woodland areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and as a stabilizing plant in erosion-prone areas."
