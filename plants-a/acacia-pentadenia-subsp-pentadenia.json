    "intro": "Acacia pentadenia subsp. pentadenia, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact, globular clusters, which are followed by long, slender pods containing seeds. It thrives in coastal and sandy environments, often tolerating saline conditions. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various insects and birds.",

It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is commonly associated with shrublands and open woodlands. The plant is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia pentadenia subsp. pentadenia was mainly introduced to urban and suburban areas in South Africa, particularly in the Western Cape region. It is commonly found along roadsides, in gardens, and on rocky outcrops due to its adaptability to various soil types. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental value, with its feathery foliage and yellow flowers making it a popular choice for landscaping. However, it has also been identified as an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native flora. Its introduction has led to increased management efforts to control its spread in natural habitats."
