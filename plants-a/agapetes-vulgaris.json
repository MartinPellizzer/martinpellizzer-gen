    "intro": "Agapetes vulgaris, commonly known as the common agapetes, is a species of flowering plant in the Ericaceae family. It is native to the temperate regions of the Americas and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with small, elliptical leaves that are densely packed. Its flowers are usually white or pink, arranged in clusters, and it produces berries that are edible for some bird species. Agapetes vulgaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
