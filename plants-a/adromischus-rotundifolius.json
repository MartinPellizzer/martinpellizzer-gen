    "intro": "Adromischus rotundifolius, commonly known as the round-leafed ice plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, rounded leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. Its compact growth habit and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting.",
