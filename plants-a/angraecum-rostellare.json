    "intro": "Angraecum rostellare, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a species of orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink with a deep violet or purple center. The plant produces long, slender stems that bear clusters of these showy blooms, which are often fragrant. Angraecum rostellare is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other structures rather than in soil. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light."
