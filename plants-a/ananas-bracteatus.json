    "intro": "Ananas bracteatus, commonly known as the pineapple lily, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces a striking inflorescence with brightly colored bracts that resemble a pineapple, hence its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, while the showy bracts attract pollinators such as birds and insects."
