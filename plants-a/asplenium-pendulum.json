    "intro": "Asplenium pendulum, commonly known as the hanging spleenwort, is a fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a small, epiphytic plant that grows on trees, rocks, or soil, often in shaded, moist environments. Its fronds are typically slender and drooping, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant has a simple rhizome and produces spore-bearing leaves called sporangia on the underside of its fronds. Asplenium pendulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
