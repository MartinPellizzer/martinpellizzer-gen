    "intro": "Acrostichum frigidum, commonly known as the cold fern, is a species of fern native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a perennial plant that thrives in cold, moist environments, often found in tundra and alpine habitats. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Acrostichum frigidum plays a vital role in the ecological balance of its harsh environment, providing habitat and food for various small organisms.",
