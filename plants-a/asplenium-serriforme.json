    "intro": "Asplenium serriforme, commonly known as the serrated spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically adorned with finely serrated edges. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called soridia on the underside of its leaves, which are often clustered in small, circular patches. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as rock crevices or damp woodlands, and is often found growing on limestone or other calcareous substrates. Asplenium serriforme is a hardy species that is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
