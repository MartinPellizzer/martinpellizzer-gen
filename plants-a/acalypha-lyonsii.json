    "intro": "Acalypha lyonsii, commonly known as Lyon's spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a rough, hairy texture, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters. Its botanical characteristics include a woody stem that becomes more pronounced with age, and it is often found in wetland habitats. Lyon's spurge is notable for its ecological role in supporting local insect populations and its adaptability to humid climates.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha lyonsii is primarily native to Queensland. It is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the state. This plant typically grows in wetlands, swamps, and along waterways. It is commonly associated with riparian habitats and is often found in areas with high moisture levels. Its native distribution is largely confined to the northeastern parts of Queensland.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha lyonsii was mainly introduced to Hawaii. It was brought there by early European settlers and has since become naturalized in certain areas. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in coastal and lowland habitats. It is considered an invasive species in some parts of the Hawaiian Islands. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread, it poses a threat to native vegetation."
