    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Absinthium ponticum is primarily native to southern and eastern Europe, including regions such as the Balkans, the Carpathian Mountains, and parts of Russia. It thrives in dry, rocky, and sometimes saline soils, often found in open habitats like grasslands and wastelands. This plant is commonly associated with disturbed soils and can be found along roadsides and in agricultural areas. It is also present in parts of western Asia, extending into Turkey and the Middle East. Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to other parts of the world but remains most closely tied to its native range in Europe and western Asia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Absinthium ponticum was mainly introduced to Europe through ancient trade routes and botanical exchanges. It was valued for its medicinal properties and was used in traditional herbal remedies. The plant was also introduced to parts of North America during the 19th century as an ornamental species. Its distribution is now widespread in temperate regions, often thriving in disturbed soils and along roadsides. However, it is considered invasive in some areas due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
