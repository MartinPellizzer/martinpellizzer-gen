It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often grayish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common component of native grassland ecosystems. Tall bluestem is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
