    "intro": "Astronia inflata, commonly known as the inflated astronia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is notable for its inflated, balloon-like fruit that develops from the base of the flower, which aids in seed dispersal. Its foliage consists of alternate, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Astronia inflata is often found in woodland and savanna habitats, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
