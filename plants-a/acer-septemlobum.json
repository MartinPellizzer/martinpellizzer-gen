    "intro": "Acer septemlobum, commonly known as the seven-lobed maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which typically have seven distinct lobes, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming more rugged with age. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal.",
