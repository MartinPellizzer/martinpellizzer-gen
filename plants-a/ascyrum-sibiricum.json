    "intro": "Ascyrum sibiricum, commonly known as Siberian rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important plants such as mustard and cabbage. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, basal leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Ascyrum sibiricum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
