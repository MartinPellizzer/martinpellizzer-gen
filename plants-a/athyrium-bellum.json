    "intro": "Athyrium bellum, commonly known as the golden sword fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its elegant, sword-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forests and rocky areas. Athyrium bellum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
