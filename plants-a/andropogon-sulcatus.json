    "intro": "Andropogon sulcatus, commonly known as the ridgegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves with a prominent midrib. The plant typically grows in wetland areas, including marshes and swampy soils, and thrives in humid, subtropical climates. Its flowers are small and clustered in panicles, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Andropogon sulcatus plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
