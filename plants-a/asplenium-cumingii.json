    "intro": "Asplenium cumingii, commonly known as the Cuming's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often clustered at the base, forming a rosette-like structure. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Asplenium cumingii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
