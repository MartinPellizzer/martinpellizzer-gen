    "intro": "Aeschynomene brasiliana var. venezolana, commonly known as the Venezuelan false indigo, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in the spring and summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps it thrive in poor soil conditions. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
