    "intro": "Acer pseudoplatanus f. cruciatum, commonly known as the Irish sycamore or cruciate maple, is a unique variant of the common maple. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that often resemble a cross, giving it its common name. The plant is native to western Europe, particularly Ireland and parts of the British Isles. It typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. The leaves are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a rough texture that distinguishes it from other maple species.",
