    "intro": "Acalypha pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in coastal forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",

This plant is commonly associated with rocky and disturbed soils. It plays an important ecological role in the native ecosystems of Hawaii. Due to its limited range, it is considered a vulnerable species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha pringlei was mainly introduced to the Hawaiian Islands. It was brought there by early European settlers and has since become naturalized in certain areas. The plant is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open forests. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its distribution is limited to specific islands where it has established populations."
