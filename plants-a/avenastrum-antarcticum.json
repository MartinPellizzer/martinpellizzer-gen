    "intro": "Avenastrum antarcticum, commonly known as Antarctic hair grass, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic. It is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in harsh, icy environments with minimal soil. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are adapted to withstand extreme cold and wind. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine, soft hairs that help reduce water loss and protect against freezing. Avenastrum antarcticum plays a crucial role in the fragile ecosystems of polar regions, providing habitat and food for local wildlife."
