It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. This species plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
