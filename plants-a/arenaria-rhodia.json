    "intro": "Arenaria rhodia, commonly known as the sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments. It typically features small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in loose, sandy soils. Arenaria rhodia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
