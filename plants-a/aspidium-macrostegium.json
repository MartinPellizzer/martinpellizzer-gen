    "intro": "Aspidium macrostegium, commonly known as the broad-stemmed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Water Ferns. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often used in ornamental water gardens. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, anchoring the plant and facilitating the growth of new fronds. The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
