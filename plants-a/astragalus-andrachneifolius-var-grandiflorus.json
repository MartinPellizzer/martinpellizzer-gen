    "intro": "Astragalus andrachneifolius var. grandiflorus, commonly known as the large-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It features a taproot system and slender, branched stems that often grow from 30 to 60 centimeters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow to orange flowers, which are typically pea-shaped and arranged in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval to lance-shaped leaflets, and the plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
