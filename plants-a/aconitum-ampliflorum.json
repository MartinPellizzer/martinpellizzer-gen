    "intro": "Aconitum ampliflorum, commonly known as the broadflower monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking, hood-shaped blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has large, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.",
