    "intro": "Acinos alpinus var. elatior, commonly known as the alpine everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. It is often used in dried floral arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms and delicate appearance.",
