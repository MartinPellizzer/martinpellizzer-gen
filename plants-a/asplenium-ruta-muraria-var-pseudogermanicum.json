    "intro": "Asplenium ruta-muraria var. pseudogermanicum, commonly known as the False Wall-Rue, is a variant of the common rock fern. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found on limestone or calcareous soils. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with small, lance-shaped fronds that are usually dark green. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. This variety is characterized by its distinct leaf morphology and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
