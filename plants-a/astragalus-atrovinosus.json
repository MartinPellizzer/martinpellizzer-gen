    "intro": "Astragalus atrovinosus, commonly known as black vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Astragalus atrovinosus is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
