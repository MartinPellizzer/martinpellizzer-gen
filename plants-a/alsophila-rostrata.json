    "intro": "Alsophila rostrata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and feathery, compound fronds that grow in a spiral pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in tropical and subtropical forests. Its fronds are dimorphic, with sterile and fertile leaves, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. The plant's structure reflects its adaptation to moist, nutrient-rich soils and its role in forest ecosystems."
