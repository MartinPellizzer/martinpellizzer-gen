    "intro": "Acantholimon subflavescens, commonly known as the flaxleaf flaxflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.",

It is commonly found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the eastern and central areas. This plant thrives in rocky and gravelly soils at high altitudes. It is often associated with alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in Afghanistan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon subflavescens was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It is commonly found in coastal scrub and grassland habitats. This plant is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure and silver-gray foliage. It is often mistaken for native species due to its similar appearance. However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation."
