    "intro": "Artemisia campestris var. caudata, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late summer. The plant is often found in dry, disturbed soils and can thrive in full sun. It has a strong, bitter scent due to the presence of essential oils, particularly thujone. This variety is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a companion plant in gardens."
