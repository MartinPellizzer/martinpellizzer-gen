    "intro": "Athyrium austro-orientale, commonly known as the Eastern Asian fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into small, pointed segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in distinct patterns. Athyrium austro-orientale is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
