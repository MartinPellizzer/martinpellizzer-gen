    "intro": "Anisomeris recordii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system adapted to drought conditions and a preference for well-drained soils. Anisomeris recordii is typically found in rocky habitats and is well-suited to xerophytic environments."
