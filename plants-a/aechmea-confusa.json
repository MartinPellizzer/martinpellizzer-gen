    "intro": "Aechmea confusa, commonly known as the pink pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with flowers that range from pink to red, often resembling a pineapple in appearance. Its foliage is typically dark green with a waxy texture, and it thrives in bright, indirect light. Aechmea confusa is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
