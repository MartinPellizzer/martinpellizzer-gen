    "intro": "Aponogeton pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf arum, is a small aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with a short, narrow stem that often roots in the substrate. The plant produces striking, spatulate-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in ponds and water gardens. Aponogeton pygmaeus is also notable for its ability to survive through dry periods by entering a dormant state."
