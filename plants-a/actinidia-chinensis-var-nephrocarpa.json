    "intro": "Actinidia chinensis var. nephrocarpa, commonly known as the kidney-leaf actinidia, is a deciduous vine native to China. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, kidney-like leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, fuzzy berries that ripen to a bright orange-red color in the fall. These berries are rich in vitamin C and have been used in traditional Chinese medicine. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its foliage and fruit.",
