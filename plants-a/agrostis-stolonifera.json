    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera, commonly known as mat grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically green or pale brown in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along stream banks. Agrostis stolonifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
