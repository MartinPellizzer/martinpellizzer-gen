    "intro": "Arctium chamaepeuce, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and thistles, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a tall, erect stem with broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its most distinctive feature is the spiky, bur-like fruit that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. Arctium chamaepeuce is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates."
