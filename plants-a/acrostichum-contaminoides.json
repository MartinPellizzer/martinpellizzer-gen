It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it plays a role in soil stabilization. The plant's spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of its fronds.",
