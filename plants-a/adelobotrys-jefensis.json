    "intro": "Adelobotrys jefensis, commonly known as the Jefens Island vine, is a climbing plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy, dark green surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the wet season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Adelobotrys jefensis is often found in humid, lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.",
