    "intro": "Aneurolepidium pseudoagropyrum, commonly known as the slender spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and forest edges. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. Aneurolepidium pseudoagropyrum plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
