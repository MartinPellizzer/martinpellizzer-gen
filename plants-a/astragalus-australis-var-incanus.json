    "intro": "Astragalus australis var. incanus, commonly known as the coastal milkvetch, is a perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are usually compound, with numerous small leaflets, and it produces pods that contain seeds with silky hairs. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for native wildlife."
