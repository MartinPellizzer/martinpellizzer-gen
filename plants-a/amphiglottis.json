    "intro": "Amphiglottis, commonly known as the common tamarisk, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Tamaricaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are often mistaken for true leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in catkins. Amphiglottis is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in dry conditions. It is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
