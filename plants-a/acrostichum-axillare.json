    "intro": "Acrostichum axillare, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows in rocky or coastal habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds that are often curled or rolled. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of ferns. Acrostichum axillare is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand harsh coastal conditions.",
