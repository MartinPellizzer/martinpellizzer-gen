    "intro": "Acer pentaphyllum, commonly known as the five-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its unique foliage, featuring five lobes on each leaf, which gives it its common name. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red samaras that disperse its seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant fall color.",
