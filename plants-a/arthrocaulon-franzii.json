    "intro": "Arthrocaulon franzii, commonly known as the Franz's clubmoss, is a rare and primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a creeping, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces microspores and megaspores on separate structures, typical of its ancient lineage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed habitats."
