    "intro": "Asplenium braithwaitei, commonly known as the Braithwaite's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This plant is often found growing on rocky substrates or in shaded, moist environments, such as crevices in cliffs or under tree canopies. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in a compact, rosette-like structure. Asplenium braithwaitei is a primitive fern with a simple, non-vascular structure, making it an interesting subject for botanical study."
