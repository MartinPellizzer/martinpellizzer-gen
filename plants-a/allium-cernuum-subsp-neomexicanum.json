    "intro": "Allium cernuum subsp. neomexicanum, commonly known as the New Mexico nodding onion, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States. It features basal rosettes of lance-shaped, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped, white or pale purple flowers that droop downward. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open grasslands. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its bulbous root system. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly larger size and more robust growth compared to the typical A. cernuum."
