    "intro": "Acer saccharum var. leucoderme, commonly known as the white-veined sugar maple, is a variant of the sugar maple tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive white veins on the leaves, which contrast with the green foliage. The tree produces sweet sap, similar to the common sugar maple, which can be tapped for syrup production. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in forest ecosystems.",
