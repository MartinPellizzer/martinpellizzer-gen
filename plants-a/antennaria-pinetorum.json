    "intro": "Antennaria pinetorum, commonly known as the pine hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as pine forests and heathlands. Antennaria pinetorum is adapted to cool, temperate climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
