    "intro": "Artemisia vulgaris var. glandulifera, commonly known as common tansy, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray leaves and small yellow flowers that appear in late summer. The plant contains volatile oils and compounds such as thujone, which contribute to its strong aromatic properties. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered invasive in some regions and requires careful management."
