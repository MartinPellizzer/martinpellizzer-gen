    "intro": "Astragalus alpinus subsp. borealis, commonly known as the alpine milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain small, kidney-shaped seeds. This subspecies plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme climates."
