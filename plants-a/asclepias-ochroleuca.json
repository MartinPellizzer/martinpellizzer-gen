    "intro": "Asclepias ochroleuca, commonly known as the yellow milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, making it toxic to many animals. It plays a vital role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae. Asclepias ochroleuca typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks."
