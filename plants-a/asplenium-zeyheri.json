    "intro": "Asplenium zeyheri, commonly known as the Zeyher's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and possesses dark green, leathery, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in rock crevices or on tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in rows on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium zeyheri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
