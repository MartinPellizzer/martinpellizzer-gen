    "intro": "Antennaria saxatilis, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and coastal environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It has small, spoon-shaped leaves that are densely packed along its stems, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its root system is fibrous and helps it anchor in loose, rocky soils. Antennaria saxatilis is often found in maritime climates and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
