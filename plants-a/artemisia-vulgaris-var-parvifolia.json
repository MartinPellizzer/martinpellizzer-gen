    "intro": "Artemisia vulgaris var. parvifolia, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features silver-gray, aromatic foliage with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically smaller than those of the standard Artemisia vulgaris. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, which are borne on slender stems during the summer months. It thrives in dry, sunny conditions and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. This variant is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used historically in herbal remedies and as a flavoring agent."
