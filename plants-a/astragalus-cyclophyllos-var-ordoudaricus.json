    "intro": "Astragalus cyclophyllos var. ordoudaricus, commonly known as the Ordoudaric milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
