    "intro": "Athanasia obovata, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round, dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its hardy nature and ability to withstand drought make it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
