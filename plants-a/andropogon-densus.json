    "intro": "Andropogon densus, commonly known as thickgrass bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed sites, reaching heights of 1 to 3 meters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. Andropogon densus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting wildlife."
