    "intro": "Amalophyllon rupestre, commonly known as the rock amalophyllon, is a rare and specialized plant species native to arid and rocky habitats. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in survival in dry environments. The plant typically grows in crevices and on rocky outcrops, where it can access limited soil and nutrients. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually green or reddish, adapting to the harsh conditions of its native range. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, Amalophyllon rupestre is considered a vulnerable species in its native regions."
