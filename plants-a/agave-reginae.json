    "intro": "Agave reginae, commonly known as the Queen's agave, is a species native to the tropical highlands of Mexico. It is a succulent plant characterized by its rosette-shaped arrangement of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The leaves are lined with sharp spines and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces a tall flowering stalk that bears yellowish-green flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
