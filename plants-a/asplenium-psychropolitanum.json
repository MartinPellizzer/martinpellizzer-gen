    "intro": "Asplenium psychropolitanum, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and elusive species of fern native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that appear almost ethereal, often giving the impression of being semi-transparent. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in dense tropical forests. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, Asplenium psychropolitanum is considered endangered, highlighting the need for its protection."
