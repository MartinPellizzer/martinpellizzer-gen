    "intro": "Agrostis parlatorei, commonly known as the Parlatore's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis parlatorei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
