    "intro": "Asplenium dusenii, commonly known as the Dusen's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically produces spore-bearing structures called sorangia on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or on tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Asplenium dusenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
