    "intro": "Angraecum sambiranoense, commonly known as the Sambirano star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Madagascar rainforests. It is characterized by its long, slender inflorescence and striking white flowers with prominent purple and yellow markings. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and specific humidity to bloom. Its unique floral structure suggests a specialized pollination mechanism, likely involving moths. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native region."
