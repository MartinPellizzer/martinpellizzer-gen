    "intro": "Ampelocissus edulis, commonly known as the edible fig-leaf vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by inedible, woody fruits. Its stems are woody and can grow quite long, allowing it to climb trees and other structures. Ampelocissus edulis is also valued for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
