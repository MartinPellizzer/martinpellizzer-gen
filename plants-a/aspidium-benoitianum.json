    "intro": "Aspidium benoitianum, commonly known as the Benoit's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are released from small, clustered sori located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium benoitianum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
