    "intro": "Amberboa sosnovskyi, commonly known as the Sosnovsky's amberboa, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
