    "intro": "Athyrium fallax, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like fronds that exhibit a zigzag pattern along their length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its foliage is usually a deep green, with sporangia forming on the undersides of the fronds. Athyrium fallax is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
