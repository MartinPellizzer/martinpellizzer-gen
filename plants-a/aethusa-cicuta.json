    "intro": "Aethusa cicuta, commonly known as water hemlock, is a toxic flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and small, umbrella-like clusters of white or greenish flowers. The plant contains potent toxins, including cicutoxin, which can be lethal to humans and animals if ingested. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided lobes, and it often grows in moist, disturbed soils. Despite its dangers, it plays a role in certain ecological systems and has been used in traditional medicine with caution."
