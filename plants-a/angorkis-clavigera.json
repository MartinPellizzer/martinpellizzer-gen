    "intro": "Angorkis clavigera, commonly known as the slender-stemmed orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires specific conditions to bloom, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often clustered at the base of the stem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Angorkis clavigera is considered endangered in its natural range."
