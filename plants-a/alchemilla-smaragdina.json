    "intro": "Alchemilla smaragdina, commonly known as the Emerald Lady, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features dense clusters of bright green leaves that form a mat-like structure, often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender stalks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Alchemilla smaragdina is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
