    "intro": "Arenaria emarginata subsp. salzmannii, commonly known as Salzmann's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its morphology is adapted to withstand drought and intense sunlight, making it a resilient species in its native range."
