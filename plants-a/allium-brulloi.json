    "intro": "Allium brulloi, commonly known as the Brullo's onion, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern Italy. It is a bulbous plant with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pale purple flowers in umbels. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils at high altitudes. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Allium brulloi is considered a vulnerable species."
