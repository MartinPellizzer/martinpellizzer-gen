    "intro": "Asplenium bulbiferum var. hookerianum, commonly known as the Hooker's spleenwort, is a fern native to New Zealand. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees or rocks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base. One of its notable features is the ability to produce plantlets on its leaf tips, a characteristic known as bulbiferous growth. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, indoor settings."
