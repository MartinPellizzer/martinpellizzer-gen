    "intro": "Aconitum carmichaelii var. albovillosum, commonly known as the white-flowered Chinese aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features striking, large, showy flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, though the variety albovillosum has white petals. The plant has a tall, erect stem with palmate leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
