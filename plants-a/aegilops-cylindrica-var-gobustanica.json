    "intro": "Aegilops cylindrica var. gobustanica, commonly known as the goblet wheat, is a wild grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, showing adaptability to harsh environmental conditions. Its grains are small and cylindrical, with a distinctive hollow stem that gives it its common name. This species is of interest to researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement."
