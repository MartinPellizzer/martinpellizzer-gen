It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually green to bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are often yellowish or brownish in hue. Anthoxanthum paniculatum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of soil types, making it a common weed in agricultural settings."
