    "intro": "Aspidium dissectum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams, marshes, or in damp forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium dissectum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and soil conditions."
