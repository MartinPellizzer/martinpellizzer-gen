    "intro": "Artemisia gobica, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, silver-gray foliage with finely divided leaves that release a strong, camphor-like scent when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or dry garden environments. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been historically used in herbal remedies and as a natural insect repellent."
