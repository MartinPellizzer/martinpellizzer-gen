    "intro": "Adiantum rhomboideum, commonly known as the rhombic maidenhair fern, is a delicate and ornamental fern species native to the southeastern United States. It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and thrives in well-drained, acidic soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique, linear pattern on the underside of the fronds. Adiantum rhomboideum is valued for its elegant foliage and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.",
