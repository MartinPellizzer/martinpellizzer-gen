    "intro": "Ammannia simpliciuscula, commonly known as the small-leaf ammannia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its small, simple leaves and clusters of tiny, red flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, sunny conditions. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an effective colonizer of disturbed aquatic habitats. The species is also noted for its ability to tolerate a wide range of soil types and water depths."
