    "intro": "Anogramma hispidula, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a thin, membranous cover. Anogramma hispidula is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded conditions."
