    "intro": "Aphelandra ornata, commonly known as the golden flame plant, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that bear bright yellow bracts, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a glossy texture and a mild, citrus-like scent. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Aphelandra ornata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant appearance and air-purifying qualities."
