It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant's foliage is typically a vibrant green with red or orange markings, adding to its ornamental appeal. It produces showy inflorescences with brightly colored flowers, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Aechmea leopoldii thrives in humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
