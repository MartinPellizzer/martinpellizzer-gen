    "intro": "Asclepias rubricaulis, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking red-tinted stems and clusters of orange to yellow flowers. The plant belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is known for its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers have distinctive horn-shaped structures called corona. Asclepias rubricaulis plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae."
