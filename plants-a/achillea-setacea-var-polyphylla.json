    "intro": "Achillea setacea var. polyphylla, commonly known as the Alpine yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a compact, bushy growth habit with finely divided, silver-gray leaves that are aromatic and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and prefers full sun exposure. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in alpine gardens and rockeries.",
