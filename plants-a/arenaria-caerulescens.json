    "intro": "Arenaria caerulescens, commonly known as blue sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern hemisphere. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas or alpine environments. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Arenaria caerulescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
