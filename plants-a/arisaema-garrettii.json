    "intro": "Arisaema garrettii, commonly known as the Garrett's arrowhead, is a member of the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence structure. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China and is known for its striking, arrow-shaped leaves. The plant produces a spadix surrounded by a spathe, a feature typical of many arum species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
