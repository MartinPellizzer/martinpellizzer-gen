    "intro": "Athyrium ensiferum, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping and produces roots that help anchor it to rocky or soil surfaces. Athyrium ensiferum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
