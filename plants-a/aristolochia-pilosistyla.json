    "intro": "Aristolochia pilosistyla, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, heart-shaped leaves and its unique, winding flower that resembles a pipe. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its vines can grow up to 10 feet long, and it is often found in moist, wooded areas. The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals, making it important to handle with care."
