It features heart-shaped, aromatic leaves with a distinctive, often dark green coloration. The plant produces unique, spiral-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-brown with a strong, musky odor. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used in traditional medicine, though it contains toxic compounds that require careful handling."
