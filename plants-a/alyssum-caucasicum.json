    "intro": "Alyssum caucasicum, commonly known as Caucasian alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Caucasus region. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has succulent, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its native arid environment. It produces numerous tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. Alyssum caucasicum is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
