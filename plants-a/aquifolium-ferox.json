    "intro": "Aquifolium ferox, commonly known as the poison ivy. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically three to five lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves contain urushiol, an oily resin that causes severe skin irritation in many individuals. Aquifolium ferox is native to parts of Asia and is often found in moist, wooded areas."
