It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems through its nitrogen-fixing abilities. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
