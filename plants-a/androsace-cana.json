    "intro": "Androsace cana, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in early summer, producing pink or white flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
