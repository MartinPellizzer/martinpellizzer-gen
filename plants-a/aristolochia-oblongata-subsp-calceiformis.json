    "intro": "Aristolochia oblongata subsp. calceiformis, commonly known as the Chinese birthwort, is a perennial climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, irregularly shaped, and often twisted leaves that are typically heart-shaped or kidney-shaped. The plant produces showy, hooded flowers that are usually purple or greenish in color, which are highly specialized for pollination by specific insects. Its tuberous roots are valued in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported medicinal properties. The species is also noted for its complex chemical composition, including various aristolochic acids, which have both medicinal and toxicological significance."
