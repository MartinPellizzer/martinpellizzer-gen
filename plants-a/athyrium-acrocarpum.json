    "intro": "Athyrium acrocarpum, commonly known as the broad-leaf mountain fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its bipinnate fronds that are often broad and leathery. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
