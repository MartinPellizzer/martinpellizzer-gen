It features a basal rosette of smooth, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a loose cluster at the end of each stem. It thrives in moist, sunny habitats such as wetlands and prairies. Botanically, it is notable for its simple, alternate leaf arrangement and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
