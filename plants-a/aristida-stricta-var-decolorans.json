    "intro": "Aristida stricta var. decolorans, commonly known as the Decoloring Threeawn, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with a pale or decolorated hue, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native range."
