    "intro": "Avena arvensis, commonly known as common oat, is a grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is an annual or biennial plant that grows up to 1 meter tall, characterized by its slender stem and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets with bracts and small, white to pale green flowers. Its seeds, which are enclosed in a protective hull, are widely used in agriculture and as a food source. Avena arvensis is also considered a weed in many cultivated fields due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
