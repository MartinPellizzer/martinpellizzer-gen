    "intro": "Austrostipa velutina, commonly known as the velvet wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves covered in a fine, silky coating, giving it a velvety texture. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are typically clustered in panicles, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Austrostipa velutina is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes."
