    "intro": "Ageratinastrum lejolyanum, commonly known as the Mexican blueweed, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces small, blue to purple flower heads that are often clustered together. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Ageratinastrum lejolyanum is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive, compact form and vibrant flower color."
