    "intro": "Aechmea gamosepala var. gamosepala, commonly known as the velvet plant, is a bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, spadix-like inflorescences with vibrant red bracts. Its foliage is thick and leathery, often with a velvety texture. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
