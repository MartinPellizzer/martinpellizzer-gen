    "intro": "Angraecum obanense, commonly known as the Obanese orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the high-altitude forests of East Africa. It is characterized by its long, drooping inflorescences and large, showy flowers that typically bloom at night, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators. The plant has a unique adaptation of producing nectar-rich spurs that extend from its petals, which are specifically adapted to accommodate the long proboscis of the hawkmoth. Angraecum obanense thrives in cool, humid environments with indirect light, making it a challenging but rewarding plant for experienced growers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
