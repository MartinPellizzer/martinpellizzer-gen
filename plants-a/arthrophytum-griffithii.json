It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit. The plant features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white during the summer months. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
