    "intro": "Abies jaliscana, commonly known as the Jalisco fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the high-altitude regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces cones that are typically 5\u20138 centimeters long, containing winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 2,000 and 3,500 meters. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies jaliscana is primarily native to Mexico Southwest. It is found in the mountainous regions of the state of Jalisco. This species thrives in temperate to subtropical climates at higher elevations. It is commonly associated with cloud forests and pine-oak woodlands. Its natural range is limited to specific habitats within this geographic area.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies jaliscana was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates that mimic its native habitat in the Sierra Madre mountains of Mexico. It thrives in areas with high elevation, moderate rainfall, and well-drained soils. This plant is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas for its ecological and ornamental value. Its introduction has helped in reforestation efforts and biodiversity conservation in similar ecosystems. However, it requires careful management to prevent potential invasive spread in non-native environments."
