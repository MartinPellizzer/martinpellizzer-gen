    "intro": "Asplenium akimense, commonly known as the Akim fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and slightly glossy. Native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help it spread across forest floors. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns."
