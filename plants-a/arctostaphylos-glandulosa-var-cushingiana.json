    "intro": "Arctostaphylos glandulosa var. cushingiana, commonly known as Cushing's manzanita, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its reddish-brown bark and evergreen foliage, with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically glandular-dotted. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in clusters during the spring, which are pollinated by insects. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds. This species is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral habitats."
