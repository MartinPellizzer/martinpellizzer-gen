    "intro": "Alchemilla curaica, commonly known as the Balkan lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. Alchemilla curaica thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help retain moisture and reduce evaporation."
