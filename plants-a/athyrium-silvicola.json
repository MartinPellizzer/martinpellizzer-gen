    "intro": "Athyrium silvicola, commonly known as the forest fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, preferring well-drained, acidic soils. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, aiding in its survival in woodland habitats. Athyrium silvicola is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
