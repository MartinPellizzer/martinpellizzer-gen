    "intro": "Angiopteris leytensis, commonly known as the Leyte water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that help it spread across water surfaces. Its leaves are bipinnate, with a feathery appearance, and they play a role in photosynthesis while also providing shelter for small aquatic organisms. Angiopteris leytensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in maintaining water quality in its native environment."
