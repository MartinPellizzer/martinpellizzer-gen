    "intro": "Armeria linearifolia, commonly known as the sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime climates. Its leaves are linear and needle-like, giving it a distinctive appearance, while its flowers are typically borne on short, upright stems. Armeria linearifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
