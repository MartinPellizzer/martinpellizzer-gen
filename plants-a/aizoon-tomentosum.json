    "intro": "Aizoon tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly aizoon, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, tubular flowers are usually pale blue or purple, and they bloom in clusters. Aizoon tomentosum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
