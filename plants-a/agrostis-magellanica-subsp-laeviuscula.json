    "intro": "Agrostis magellanica subsp. laeviuscula, commonly known as the Magellan bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant typically thrives in temperate climates and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in its native habitat."
