    "intro": "Aloe trichotoma, commonly known as the narrow-leaved aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features upright, branched stems that bear fleshy, narrow leaves with a distinctive hairy texture. The leaves are typically green with a whitish or bluish tinge, and they often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces yellow flowers in clusters during the rainy season, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional medicine."
