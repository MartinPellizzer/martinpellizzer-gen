    "intro": "Aphyllorchis aberrans, commonly known as the aberrant orchid, is a rare and enigmatic species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a compact, sympodial growth habit and a single, often atypical floral structure. The plant lacks true leaves, with photosynthesis occurring primarily through its pseudobulbs and roots. Its flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, with a complex arrangement of sepals and petals. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Aphyllorchis aberrans is considered a critically endangered species in its native range."
