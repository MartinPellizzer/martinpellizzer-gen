    "intro": "Aspidium waikarense, commonly known as the Waikare fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Aspidium waikarense plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to biodiversity and soil stability."
