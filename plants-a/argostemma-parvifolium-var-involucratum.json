    "intro": "Argostemma parvifolium var. involucratum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf argostemma, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems. The plant features small, opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces, and its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
