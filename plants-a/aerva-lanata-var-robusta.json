It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows up to 1.5 meters in height, featuring alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to cream-colored flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and diuretic properties.
