    "intro": "Avena \u00d7 haussknechtii, commonly known as the hybrid oat, is a sterile intergeneric hybrid resulting from the cross between Avena sativa (common oat) and Avena fatua (wild oat). This plant exhibits characteristics of both parent species, including tall, slender stems and feathery leaves. It is typically found in disturbed soils and agricultural fields, where it can become a weed. The hybrid is not commonly cultivated due to its sterility and lack of grain production. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a model for studying hybridization in the grass family."
