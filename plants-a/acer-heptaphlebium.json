It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with seven prominent veins, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, red or yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in temperate forests.
