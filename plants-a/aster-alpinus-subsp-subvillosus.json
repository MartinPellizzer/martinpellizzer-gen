It is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of white to pale blue. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in harsh, high-altitude environments. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
