    "intro": "Avena bulbosa, commonly known as bulbous oat, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact, bulb-like base and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Avena bulbosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
