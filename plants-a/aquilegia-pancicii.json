    "intro": "Aquilegia pancicii, commonly known as the Pancici's columbine, is a rare and endangered species native to the alpine regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its striking blue and violet spurred petals, which are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it faces harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Due to habitat loss and climate change, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
