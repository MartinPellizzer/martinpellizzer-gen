    "intro": "Aspidium tanacetifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern found in freshwater habitats. It has finely divided, needle-like leaves that resemble those of the plantain, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense mats. Its fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. Aspidium tanacetifolium plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
