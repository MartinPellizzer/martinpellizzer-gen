    "intro": "Artemisia chanousii, commonly known as white sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of aromatic, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters at the ends of branches. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Artemisia chanousii is widely used in traditional Native American ceremonies and for its purported medicinal properties."
