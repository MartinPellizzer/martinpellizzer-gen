    "intro": "Athyrium glabrescens, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to the eastern United States. It is a fern characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in a dense, velvety layer of hairs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a similar hairy coating, which helps protect it from environmental stress. Athyrium glabrescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, fern-like appearance."
