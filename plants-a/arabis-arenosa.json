    "intro": "Arabis arenosa, commonly known as the sand arabis, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, blue-green leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in sandy or rocky soils. It thrives in full sun and is often found in coastal dunes, dry grasslands, and disturbed soils. Arabis arenosa is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that is both ornamental and ecologically valuable in its native habitats."
