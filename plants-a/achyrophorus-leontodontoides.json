    "intro": "Achyrophorus leontodontoides, commonly known as the mountain larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of North America. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in mountainous areas. The plant has a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces tall, sparsely branched stems with showy blue to purple flowers. Its flowers are arranged in racemes and are visited by various pollinators, including bees and butterflies. The plant is toxic to livestock and humans due to the presence of alkaloids, making it a potentially dangerous species in its habitat.",
