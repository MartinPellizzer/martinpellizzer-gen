    "intro": "Agathis montana, commonly known as the mountain agathis, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the highlands of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Araucariaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The tree produces large, conical cones that contain edible seeds, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing natural defenses against pests and environmental stress. Agathis montana is also valued for its durable wood, which has been traditionally used in construction and furniture-making."
