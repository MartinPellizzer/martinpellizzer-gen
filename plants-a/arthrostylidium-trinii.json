It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming during the warmer months. Arthrostylidium trinii thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to tolerate salt spray and strong winds. Its rapid growth and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for coastal gardens and restoration projects."
