    "intro": "Anisopappus alticola, commonly known as the alpine pappus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in harsh, alpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and silvery-gray, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Anisopappus alticola produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to the biodiversity of its mountainous habitat."
