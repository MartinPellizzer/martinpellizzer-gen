    "intro": "Acaena \u00d7 ovina, commonly known as New Zealand spinach, is a hybrid plant originating from the cross between Acaena crassipes and Acaena hastata. It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub characterized by its dense, prickly foliage and bright yellow flowers. The plant produces small, edible berries that are often consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions of New Zealand. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain areas outside its native range.",

This plant is commonly found in a variety of habitats within these regions, including coastal areas, grasslands, and heathlands. It is well adapted to the temperate and Mediterranean climates of these states. The species is often seen in disturbed soils and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. Its distribution reflects its ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions across southern Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena \u00d7 ovina was mainly introduced to New Zealand North and New Zealand South. It is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Acaena novae-zelandiae and Acaena hastata. This species has been widely cultivated for its ornamental value and is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas. Its introduction has led to its establishment in various habitats across both regions. However, it is considered a potential weed in some areas due to its aggressive growth habit."
