    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa var. aurea, commonly known as the golden alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its golden-yellow leaves, which turn reddish-brown in the fall, adding to its ornamental value. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by woody, cone-like fruits that release seeds when disturbed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. This species is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment."
