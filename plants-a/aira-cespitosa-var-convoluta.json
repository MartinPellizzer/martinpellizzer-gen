    "intro": "Aira cespitosa var. convoluta, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades that are often rolled under the leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
