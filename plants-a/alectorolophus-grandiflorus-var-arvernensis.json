    "intro": "Alectorolophus grandiflorus var. arvernensis, commonly known as the Arvernian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of south-central France. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of striking blue to violet flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in open woodlands or rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
