    "intro": "Astragalus curtipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which bloom in early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in dry, rocky habitats. Astragalus curtipes is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations."
