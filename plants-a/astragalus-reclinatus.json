    "intro": "Astragalus reclinatus, commonly known as the reclining milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and the plant has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus reclinatus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
