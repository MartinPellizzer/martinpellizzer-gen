It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. Its botanical features make it well adapted to drought conditions and poor soil, contributing to its ecological significance in desert ecosystems."
