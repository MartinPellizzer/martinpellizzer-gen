    "intro": "Astragalus collenetteae, commonly known as the Collenette's milkvetch, is a flowering plant species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Astragalus collenetteae plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations. Its limited distribution and specialized habitat make it a subject of interest for conservation efforts."
