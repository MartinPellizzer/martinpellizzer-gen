    "intro": "Aeonium \u00d7 tenensis, commonly known as the \"Tree Aeonium,\" is a hybrid succulent native to the Canary Islands. It features a compact, tree-like structure with a short, thick stem and rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers in spring, which emerge from the center of the rosette. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with bright sunlight. Aeonium \u00d7 tenensis is popular in rock gardens and as a container plant due to its ornamental appearance and ease of care."
