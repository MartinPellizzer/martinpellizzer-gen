    "intro": "Astragalus macrorhizus, commonly known as the large-root milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It is characterized by its deep taproot system, which allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor and drought-prone soils. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. Astragalus macrorhizus is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional Chinese medicine."
