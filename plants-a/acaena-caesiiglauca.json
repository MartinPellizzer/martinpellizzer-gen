It is commonly found in the South Island, particularly in areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils. This plant thrives in open habitats such as grasslands, shrublands, and rocky slopes. It is often associated with coastal and mountainous environments where it contributes to local biodiversity. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within New Zealand's southern regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena caesiiglauca was mainly introduced to Germany and Great Britain. It is a species of flowering plant native to New Zealand. The introduction likely occurred through horticultural or ornamental trade. It has since been reported in various regions of these countries. However, its ecological impact and spread remain under study."
