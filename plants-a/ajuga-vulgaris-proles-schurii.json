    "intro": "Ajuga vulgaris proles schurii, commonly known as silver carpet, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, glossy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or silver hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for ground cover in woodland gardens."
