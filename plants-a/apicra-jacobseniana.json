    "intro": "Apicra jacobseniana, commonly known as the Jacobsen's apicra, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
