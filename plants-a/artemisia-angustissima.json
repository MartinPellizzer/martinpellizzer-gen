    "intro": "Artemisia angustissima, commonly known as narrowleaf wormwood, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its gray-green, narrow, aromatic leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in composite heads. The plant contains volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its strong medicinal and pesticidal properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, slopes, and dry grasslands. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
