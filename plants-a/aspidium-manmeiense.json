    "intro": "Aspidium manmeiense, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, glossy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Aspidium manmeiense is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
