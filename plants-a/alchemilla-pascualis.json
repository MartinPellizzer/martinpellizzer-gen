    "intro": "Alchemilla pascualis, commonly known as the meadow lady's mantle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in early summer. Native to Europe and western Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its common name reflects its historical use in folk medicine and its resemblance to the mythical alchemical symbols."
