    "intro": "Acrostichum decurrens var. major, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a large fern species native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its robust, arching fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats.",
