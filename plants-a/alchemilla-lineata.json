    "intro": "Alchemilla lineata, commonly known as the lesser mouse-ear or silverweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender, erect stems. Alchemilla lineata thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves and flowers have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their purported healing properties."
