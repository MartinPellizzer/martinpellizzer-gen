    "intro": "Aristida hystrix, commonly known as the rough fescue, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale blue to purple florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Aristida hystrix is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
