    "intro": "Abuta solimoesensis, commonly known as the Solim\u00f5es abuta, is a climbing shrub native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange or red berries. Its roots and leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abuta solimoesensis is primarily native to Brazil North, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Peru, and Suriname. This plant is found in the tropical regions of these countries, typically in humid lowland areas. It thrives in dense rainforests where it can receive ample sunlight and moisture. The species is part of the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many plants with medicinal properties. Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to the rich biodiversity of the Amazon and adjacent regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abuta solimoesensis was mainly introduced to the Amazon rainforest region of South America, particularly in the western part of Brazil. It is commonly found in areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. This plant is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats due to its adaptability. Its introduction has been linked to both natural dispersal and human activities such as deforestation and land clearing. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
