    "intro": "Astragalus ibrahimianus var. cossoniana, commonly known as the Iranian milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
