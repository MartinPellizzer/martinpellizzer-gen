    "intro": "Anthurium spathulatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces striking, spadix-shaped inflorescences surrounded by a colorful spathe, typically in shades of red or orange. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Anthurium spathulatum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
