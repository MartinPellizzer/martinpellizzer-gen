It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Native to eastern Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Arundinaria capillifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
