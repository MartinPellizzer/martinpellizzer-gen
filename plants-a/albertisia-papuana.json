    "intro": "Albertisia papuana, commonly known as the Papuan albertisia, is a flowering plant native to the lowland rainforests of Papua, Indonesia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing along stream banks or in dense undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
