    "intro": "Ammodytes melilotoides, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. The yellow sand verbena blooms from spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
