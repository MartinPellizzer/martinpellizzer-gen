    "intro": "Aristida macroclada subsp. macroclada, commonly known as the broadleaf dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are clustered along the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
