    "intro": "Aizoon arenarium, commonly known as the sand lily, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean. It is a perennial herb characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its bulbs are often used for propagation, and the species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils. Aizoon arenarium is also known for its resilience to harsh environmental conditions, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
