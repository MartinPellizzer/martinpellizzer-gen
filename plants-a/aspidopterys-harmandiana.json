    "intro": "Aspidopterys harmandiana, commonly known as the Harmand's cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family, native to Madagascar. It is a slow-growing plant with a stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine, and it plays a significant role in the local ecosystem. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species."
