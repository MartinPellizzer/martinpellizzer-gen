It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its varietal name \"villosus.\" The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as along riverbanks and in swampy areas. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of small, spikelet-bearing branches. This grass is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
