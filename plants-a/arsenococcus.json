    "intro": "Arsenococcus, commonly known as the arsenic plant, is a rare and toxic species belonging to the family Aizoaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and white. The plant is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils. It contains high levels of arsenic, which makes it poisonous to both animals and humans. Due to its toxic properties, it is rarely cultivated and is more often found in its native habitats in southern Africa."
