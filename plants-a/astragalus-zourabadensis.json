It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
