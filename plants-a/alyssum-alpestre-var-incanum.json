    "intro": "Alyssum alpestre var. incanum, commonly known as the alpine alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces fluffy, grayish-white seed heads that are often mistaken for wool, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early autumn."
