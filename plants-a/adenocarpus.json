    "intro": "Adenocarpus, commonly known as the \"broom weed,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or herbs, characterized by their compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The fruit is a legume, which splits open to release the seeds. Adenocarpus species are often found in arid and semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. They play a role in soil stabilization and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
