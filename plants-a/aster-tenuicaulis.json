    "intro": "Aster tenuicaulis, commonly known as the slenderstem aster, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy surface. Aster tenuicaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
