    "intro": "Asclepias lynchiana, commonly known as the Florida milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers with distinctive, horn-like structures called horns. It is a critical host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing nourishment for both larvae and adult butterflies. Asclepias lynchiana thrives in wetlands and disturbed soils, often found in swampy areas and along riverbanks."
