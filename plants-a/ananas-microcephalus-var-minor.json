    "intro": "Ananas microcephalus var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf pineapple, is a compact, herbaceous plant native to Brazil. It features a rosette of broad, fleshy, sword-shaped leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces a small, edible fruit that is similar in appearance to the common pineapple but much smaller. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique fruit. This variety is well-suited for container gardening and can thrive in warm, humid environments."
