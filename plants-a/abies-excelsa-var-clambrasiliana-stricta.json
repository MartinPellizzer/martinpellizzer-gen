    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies excelsa var. clambrasiliana-stricta is primarily native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes Mountains in South America, specifically in countries such as Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. This variety is commonly found in cloud forests and montane ecosystems where the climate is cool and moist. It thrives in elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters above sea level. The plant is adapted to the humid and shaded conditions typical of these high-altitude habitats. Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies excelsa var. clambrasiliana-stricta was mainly introduced to regions with temperate to subtropical climates, characterized by high elevation and moderate precipitation. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires ample sunlight for optimal growth. This variety is particularly adapted to mountainous environments, making it suitable for reforestation and ornamental landscaping. Its introduction has been primarily driven by its ecological benefits and aesthetic appeal. However, its spread is limited due to specific climatic and soil requirements."
