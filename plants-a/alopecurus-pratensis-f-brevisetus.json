    "intro": "Alopecurus pratensis f. brevisetus, commonly known as the short-statured meadow grass, is a variant of the meadow foxtail. It is a perennial grass characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter stature compared to the typical form. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is typically found in moist meadows and grasslands, thriving in temperate climates. This form is of interest in botanical studies due to its distinct morphology and ecological adaptations."
