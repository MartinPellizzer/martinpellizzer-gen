    "intro": "Anabasis arbuscula, commonly known as the white goosefoot, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a white, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are yellow and occur in clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer. Anabasis arbuscula is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
