    "intro": "Astragalus nobilis var. dschanbulakensis, commonly known as the Karakorum milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep purple. The plant produces small, kidney-shaped seeds that are often dispersed by wind. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to cold climates. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
