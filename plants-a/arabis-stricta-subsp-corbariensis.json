    "intro": "Arabis stricta subsp. corbariensis, commonly known as the narrowleaf rockcress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or arctic environments. The plant has basal leaves that are narrow and linear, with small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in harsh, cold climates. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to its environment."
