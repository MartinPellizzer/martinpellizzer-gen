It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus minor is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
