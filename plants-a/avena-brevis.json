It typically grows to a height of about 10-30 centimeters, making it a compact plant with slender, hairy stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, often with a bluish-green hue. Avena brevis is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes cultivated as a forage crop or for its ornamental value."
