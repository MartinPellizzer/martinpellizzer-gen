    "intro": "Armeria humilis subsp. humilis, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions of western North America. It features dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in spring and early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its often-saline, sandy or gravelly habitats. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
