    "intro": "Alsine littoralis, commonly known as the salt marsh mosquito plant, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in marshes and estuaries. The plant has small, alternate leaves that are typically succulent to retain water in salty conditions. Its flowers are inconspicuous, clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Alsine littoralis plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
