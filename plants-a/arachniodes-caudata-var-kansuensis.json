    "intro": "Arachniodes caudata var. kansuensis, commonly known as the Kansu rock fern, is a perennial fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided, and often hairy fronds. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous areas, preferring cool and humid environments. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which help it anchor in rocky substrates. The foliage is often used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
