    "intro": "Alectorolophus montanus, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps protect it from harsh weather. Alectorolophus montanus is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often found in botanical gardens specializing in alpine flora."
