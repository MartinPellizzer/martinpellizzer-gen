    "intro": "Aegiceras, commonly known as the mangrove shrub or sea hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is primarily found in coastal areas, where it thrives in saline and brackish water conditions. The plant has specialized roots that help it anchor in soft, waterlogged soils and facilitate gas exchange. Its leaves are typically ovate or elliptical, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Aegiceras species play an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
