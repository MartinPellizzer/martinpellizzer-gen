    "intro": "Acrostichum tartareum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically less than a meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. The narrow-leaf fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.",
