    "intro": "Acer monspessulanum var. villosum, commonly known as the velvet maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely hairy leaves that give it a velvety texture. The leaves are typically palmately lobed and turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that aid in seed dispersal. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types.",
