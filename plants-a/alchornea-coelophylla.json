It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and small, inconspicuous yellow flowers. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds dispersed by animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and dry forest ecosystems. Alchornea coelophylla is valued for its hard, durable wood and its role in local biodiversity."
