    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha pavoniana is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of India and the Philippines. Acalypha pavoniana is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its vibrant foliage.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha pavoniana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage. It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since spread throughout the region. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often escaping cultivation and becoming naturalized in coastal and disturbed areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a potential invasive species in some regions. Despite its beauty, it has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact."
