    "intro": "Anguina globosa, commonly known as the globular root gall midge, is a small insect that belongs to the family Cecidomyiidae. It is primarily known for inducing the formation of galls on the roots of certain plants, particularly those in the genus *Cirsium* (thistles). The galls are abnormal growths that develop as a result of the insect's feeding activities, providing both shelter and nutrients for the developing larvae. These galls can significantly affect the growth and health of the host plant. The life cycle of *Anguina globosa* involves multiple stages, with adults emerging from the galls in the spring to begin the cycle anew."
