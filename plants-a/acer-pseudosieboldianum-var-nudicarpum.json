    "intro": "Acer pseudosieboldianum var. nudicarpum, commonly known as the naked-seed maple, is a rare variant of the maple tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern China. It is characterized by its distinctive red-orange foliage in autumn, which adds to its ornamental value. The plant produces small, winged seeds that are released without the typical samara structure, hence the \"nudicarpum\" designation. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in shaded forest environments. Due to its limited distribution and rarity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts.",
