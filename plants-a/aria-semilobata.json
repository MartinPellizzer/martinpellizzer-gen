    "intro": "Aria semilobata, commonly known as the half-lobed iris, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking blue to violet flowers with three upright petals and three recurved sepals, typical of the Iridaceae family. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy and arranged in a fan shape. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early spring blooming period and long-lasting flowers."
