    "intro": "Aechmea dichlamydea var. dichlamydea, commonly known as the pink pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's use. The leaves are typically long, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces vibrant orange to red flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, adding a dramatic visual contrast. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
