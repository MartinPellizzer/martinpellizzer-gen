    "intro": "Arenaria aggregata var. erinacea, commonly known as the hairy sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces tiny, spherical seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its colonization of open, disturbed habitats. Its leaves are typically covered in fine, hairy structures that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. This variety is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient component of tundra and rocky ecosystems."
