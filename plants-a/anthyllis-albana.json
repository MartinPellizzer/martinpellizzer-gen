It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Anthyllis albana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
