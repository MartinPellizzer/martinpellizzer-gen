It typically grows on the bark of trees or rocks in shaded, moist environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium christensenii is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in forested areas with high humidity."
