It typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are hairy, especially along the edges, giving it its subspecies name. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle with spikelets that are often tinged with purple. It plays an important role in maintaining biodiversity in its native habitats."
