    "intro": "Alnus incana f. subsericea, commonly known as the silky alder, is a subspecies of the alder tree native to northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its finely hairy, silvery-gray bark and small, ovate leaves that are alternate along the stems. The plant produces yellowish catkins in early spring, which are male and female, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils near streams or wetlands. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen and supporting diverse wildlife. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging environmental conditions."
