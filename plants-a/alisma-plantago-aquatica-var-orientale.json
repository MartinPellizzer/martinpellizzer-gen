    "intro": "Alisma plantago-aquatica var. orientale, commonly known as the oriental water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes, pond edges, and slow-moving streams, where it forms dense colonies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in spikes during the summer months. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in aquatic habitats. The plant is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ability to filter water and stabilize soil in wetland ecosystems."
