    "intro": "Alopecurus pratensis subsp. ventricosus, commonly known as bulgegrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, pastures, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has a tufted growth habit with slender, leafy stems that can reach up to 60 cm in height. Its inflorescence consists of a dense panicle of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The subspecies is characterized by its swollen, club-shaped base, which gives it its common name."
