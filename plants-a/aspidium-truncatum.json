    "intro": "Aspidium truncatum, commonly known as the interrupted water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent in the dark. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Aspidium truncatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to purify water in aquatic environments."
