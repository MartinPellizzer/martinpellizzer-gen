    "intro": "Ardisia hainanensis, commonly known as Hainan ardisia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to the island of Hainan in China and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain bird species. Ardisia hainanensis typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
