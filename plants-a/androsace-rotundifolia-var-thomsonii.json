    "intro": "Androsace rotundifolia var. thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features a dense mat of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its compact form and ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
