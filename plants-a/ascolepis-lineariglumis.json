    "intro": "Ascolepis lineariglumis, commonly known as the narrow-bracted asclepias, is a species of milkweed native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and showy, clustered flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces follicles that contain seeds with silky, hairy appendages, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or arid regions. Ascolepis lineariglumis plays a vital role in supporting local pollinators, including butterflies and bees."
