    "intro": "Amaryllis sarniensis, commonly known as the Sardinian amaryllis, is a flowering plant native to the island of Sardinia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep red. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions of its native habitat. It produces a rosette of broad, fleshy leaves and blooms in the spring or early summer. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
