It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. The plant features slender, wiry stems with small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with purple or pink hues. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive hairy texture. This species is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in native plant landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
