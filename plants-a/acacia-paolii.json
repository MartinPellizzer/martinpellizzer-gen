    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia paolii is primarily native to the island of Sicily, specifically found in the southern regions. It thrives in coastal areas and rocky soils, often growing in dry, sunny environments. This species is adapted to the Mediterranean climate, characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. It is commonly found in scrublands and along the coastline of southern Sicily. Due to its limited range, Acacia paolii is considered a rare and endemic plant in this region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia paolii was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in coastal and arid regions. It is commonly used in reforestation projects due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant has been introduced to several islands in the Pacific, including parts of Fiji and Tonga. Its introduction has led to both ecological benefits and concerns about invasive spread. Careful monitoring is recommended to ensure it does not disrupt native ecosystems."
