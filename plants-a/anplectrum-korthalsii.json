    "intro": "Anplectrum korthalsii, commonly known as the Korthals' ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to South Africa. It is characterized by its elongated, pale green or bluish-green leaves and its unique, delicate flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air humidity and moderate temperatures. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is often protected in conservation efforts."
