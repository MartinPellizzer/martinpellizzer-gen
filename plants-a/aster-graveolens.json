    "intro": "Aster graveolens, commonly known as the common tansy, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features bright yellow flowers with a strong, aromatic scent, which is due to the presence of volatile oils. Its leaves are finely divided and have a fern-like appearance, while the stems are hairy and branched. Aster graveolens is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
