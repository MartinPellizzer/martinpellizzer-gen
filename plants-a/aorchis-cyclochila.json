    "intro": "Aorchis cyclochila, commonly known as the cyclochila orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, leafy stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Aorchis cyclochila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
