    "intro": "Anogramma lorentzii, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that often grow on rocks or trees. The plant has a rhizome that is covered in a thick layer of spongy, moss-like tissue, which helps it absorb moisture from the air. Its leaves are typically divided into narrow segments and are arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Anogramma lorentzii prefers shaded, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests."
