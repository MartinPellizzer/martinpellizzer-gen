    "intro": "Altamiranoa parva, commonly known as the small altamiranoa, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has elliptical leaves with a glossy surface and is often found growing in shaded, moist environments. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists studying plant diversity in tropical regions. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of conservation efforts."
