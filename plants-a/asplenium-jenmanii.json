    "intro": "Asplenium jenmanii, commonly known as the New Zealand maidenhair fern, is a species of polypod fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium jenmanii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens as a decorative plant."
