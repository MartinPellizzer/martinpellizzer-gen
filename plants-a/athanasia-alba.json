    "intro": "Athanasia alba, commonly known as the white everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, white, daisy-like flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. It produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Athanasia alba is also noted for its long-lasting flowers, which remain intact for extended periods, giving it its common name."
