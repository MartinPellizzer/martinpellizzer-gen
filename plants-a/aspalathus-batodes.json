    "intro": "Aspalathus batodes, commonly known as the small-leaved rooibos, is a shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is closely related to the more well-known rooibos (Aspalathus linearis) and shares similar growing conditions. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a dry climate with adequate sunlight. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less commercially cultivated species compared to its relative."
