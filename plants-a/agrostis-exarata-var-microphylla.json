It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are narrow, flat, and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green color. The inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is often concealed within the foliage, giving it a distinctive appearance."
