    "intro": "Androcymbium vogelii, commonly known as the Vogel's orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and Angola. The plant features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. Its flowers are showy, with colorful, fragrant petals that attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
