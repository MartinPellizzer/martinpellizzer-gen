    "intro": "Acer \u00d7 creticum var. major, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The tree has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow in autumn. Its flowers are small and green, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming more fissured with age.",
