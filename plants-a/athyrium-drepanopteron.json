    "intro": "Athyrium drepanopteron, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Japanese painted fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense carpet of foliage, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. The spores are released from the fertile fronds, which develop in the upper part of the plant."
