    "intro": "Aspidium squarrosum, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest floors. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Aspidium squarrosum is native to various regions in the Americas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
