It is characterized by its small, bright green leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is closely related to the genus Aspalathus, which includes other species of legumes. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a Mediterranean climate with mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers. Aspalathus genistoides is primarily cultivated for its leaves, which are used to produce a caffeine-free herbal tea."
