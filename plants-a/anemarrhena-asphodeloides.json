    "intro": "Anemarrhena asphodeloides, commonly known as the Chinese sandwort, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of China. It features a fibrous root system and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its medicinal properties have been traditionally used in Chinese herbal medicine."
