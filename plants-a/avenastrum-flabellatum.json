    "intro": "Avenastrum flabellatum, commonly known as the fanleaf grass, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a fan-like pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in loose spikes, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Avenastrum flabellatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in dry garden landscapes."
