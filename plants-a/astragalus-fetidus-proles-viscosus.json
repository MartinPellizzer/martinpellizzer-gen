It is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. The sticky resin exuding from its stems is a distinctive botanical feature."
