It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, bluish-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine and subalpine ecosystems."
