    "intro": "Arachnothryx bertieroides, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its ornamental, compound leaves and showy, purple-pink flowers. The plant is often found in tropical rainforests and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its wood is highly valued for its density and rich color, making it a sought-after material in traditional craftsmanship. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species."
