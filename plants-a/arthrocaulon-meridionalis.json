    "intro": "Arthrocaulon meridionalis, commonly known as the southern jointed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that are often jointed, a feature that gives it its scientific name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the grass family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Arthrocaulon meridionalis is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops."
