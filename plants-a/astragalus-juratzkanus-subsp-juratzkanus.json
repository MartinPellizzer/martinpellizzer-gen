    "intro": "Astragalus juratzkanus subsp. juratzkanus, commonly known as the Juratzkanus milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. It has small, elliptical seeds that are often dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
