    "intro": "Anthemis fallax, commonly known as the fallax ragwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Its yellow flowers bloom in summer, and the plant produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a weed in some regions and is often avoided in agricultural settings."
