    "intro": "Agrostis alba var. prorepens, commonly known as the silver hairgrass, is a variant of the silvergrass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing perennial grass characterized by its fine, silvery-white inflorescence that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization and erosion control. The botanical features of this plant make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
