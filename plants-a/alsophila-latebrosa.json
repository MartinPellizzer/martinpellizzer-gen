    "intro": "Alsophila latebrosa, commonly known as the silver tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a robust root system that helps it thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are dimorphic, with sterile and fertile fronds differing in size and structure. Alsophila latebrosa plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
