    "intro": "Androsace armeniaca var. macrantha, commonly known as Armenian rock jasmine, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of showy, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, hairy stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and as a ground cover in suitable climates."
