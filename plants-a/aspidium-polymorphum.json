    "intro": "Aspidium polymorphum, commonly known as the variable water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Aspidium polymorphum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
