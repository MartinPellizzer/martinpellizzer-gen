    "intro": "Alhagi, commonly known as goat's head, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their distinctive, often spiny seed pods that resemble a goat's head. Alhagi species are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia, where they thrive in dry, sandy soils. They possess deep root systems that allow them to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments. The plant's ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment and as a forage plant for livestock."
