It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that are distinctive for their winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along streambanks. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and ornamental gardening.",
