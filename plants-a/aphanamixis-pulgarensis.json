It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom at night. The plant is perennial and can grow up to several meters in height, with hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale purple, and it produces berries that contain toxic seeds. Due to its ornamental value and psychoactive properties, it is sometimes cultivated, though caution is advised due to its potential toxicity."
