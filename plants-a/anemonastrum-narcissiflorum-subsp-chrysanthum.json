    "intro": "Anemonastrum narcissiflorum subsp. chrysanthum, commonly known as the yellow sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that produces clusters of bright yellow flowers resembling daisies. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
