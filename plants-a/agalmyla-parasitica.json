    "intro": "Agalmyla parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic milkweed, is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from its host through specialized root structures called haustoria. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often attaching itself to the roots of other shrubs or trees. Its leaves are usually opposite and oval-shaped, and it produces small, clustered flowers that are often pink or white in color. The plant is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils by relying on its host for essential minerals."
