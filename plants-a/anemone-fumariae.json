    "intro": "Anemone fumariae, commonly known as the smoke anemone, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, white to pale pink flowers with a distinctive, smoky appearance due to the hairy sepals. The plant has a basal rosette of heart-shaped, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Anemone fumariae is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
