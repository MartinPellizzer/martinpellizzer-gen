It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a distinctive crown of fronds that can reach several meters in height, giving it a lush, tropical appearance. Its rhizome system supports its growth and helps in nutrient absorption from the surrounding soil.
