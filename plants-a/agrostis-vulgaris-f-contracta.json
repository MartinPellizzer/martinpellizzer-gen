    "intro": "Agrostis vulgaris f. contracta, commonly known as the compact meadowgrass, is a variant of the common bentgrass. It is a low-growing perennial grass that forms dense, mat-like growth, often found in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically shorter and more compact than those of the typical form. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in shaded or partially shaded conditions. This form is often used in ornamental gardening for its fine texture and ability to create a lush, carpet-like appearance."
