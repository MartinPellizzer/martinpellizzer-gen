    "intro": "Alberta magna, commonly known as the giant alberta lichen, is a unique composite organism consisting of a fungal partner and algal or cyanobacterial symbionts. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions. The plant's structure is characterized by a thallus, which is a vegetative body that lacks true roots, stems, or leaves. It plays an important ecological role by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for various microorganisms. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is often used as an indicator species for air quality."
