    "intro": "Acer negundo f. crispum, commonly known as the curly-leaf maple, is a variant of the silver maple (Acer negundo) characterized by its distinctive, wavy, and often curled leaf margins. It is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America, typically growing in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and stream valleys. The leaves are usually palmately lobed, with a light green upper surface and a pale, hairy underside. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring followed by samaras that disperse by wind. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various environmental conditions.",
