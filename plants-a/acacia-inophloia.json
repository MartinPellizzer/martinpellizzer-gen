This species thrives in coastal and inland areas with a Mediterranean climate. It is often seen in open woodlands and along the edges of shrublands. Acacia inophloia is well adapted to the dry conditions typical of its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia inophloia was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there for its ornamental value and potential for soil stabilization. The plant has since become naturalized in several regions of the country. It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas with well-drained soils. However, it is considered a potential weed in some parts of its introduced range."
