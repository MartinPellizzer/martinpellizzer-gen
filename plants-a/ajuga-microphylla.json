    "intro": "Ajuga microphylla, commonly known as carpet bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to eastern North America. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom in early to mid-summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive appearance and ability to suppress weeds."
