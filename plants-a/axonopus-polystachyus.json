    "intro": "Axonopus polystachyus, commonly known as the hairy sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along water edges, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Axonopus polystachyus produces small, clustered flower spikes, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
