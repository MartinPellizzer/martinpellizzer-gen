    "intro": "Alchemilla elongata var. elongata, commonly known as long-stemmed lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are shield-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces upright, branched stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties. Alchemilla elongata var. elongata thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
