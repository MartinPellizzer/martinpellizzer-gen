    "intro": "Alectryon oleifolius subsp. elongatus, commonly known as the long-leaved alectryon, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often glandular-dotted, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
