    "intro": "Avena sterilis var. glabriflora, commonly known as the slender oat, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with reduced flowers, which are typically sterile, hence its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its low-growing form and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
