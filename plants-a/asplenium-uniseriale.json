    "intro": "Asplenium uniseriale, commonly known as the single-row spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant, typically found growing on rocks or trees in moist, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, linear leaves that are arranged in a single row along the stem, giving it its characteristic appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called soridia, are borne on the underside of the leaves. Asplenium uniseriale is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
