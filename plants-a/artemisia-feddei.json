    "intro": "Artemisia feddei, commonly known as the Fedde's wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small yellow flowers. The plant is known for its strong, camphor-like scent, which is due to the presence of volatile oils in its leaves. Artemisia feddei is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in dry, sunny environments. It is used in traditional medicine for its purported antiseptic and digestive properties."
