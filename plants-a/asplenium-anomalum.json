    "intro": "Asplenium anomalum, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a dense arrangement of small, needle-like pinnae. Asplenium anomalum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in containers or as part of a shaded garden landscape."
