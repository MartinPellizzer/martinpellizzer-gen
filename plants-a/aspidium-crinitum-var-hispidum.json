It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. The fronds are typically lance-shaped and have a serrated or toothed margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns."
