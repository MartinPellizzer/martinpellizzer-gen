It is characterized by its finely toothed, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a soft, silvery down. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in early spring, followed by cone-like fruits that mature in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along streambanks. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological stability and wildlife habitat."
