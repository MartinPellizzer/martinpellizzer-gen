    "intro": "Astragalus argentatus, commonly known as silver milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale blue to white in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Astragalus argentatus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
