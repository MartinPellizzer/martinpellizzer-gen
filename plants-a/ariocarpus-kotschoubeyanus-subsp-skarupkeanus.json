    "intro": "Ariocarpus kotschoubeyanus subsp. skarupkeanus, commonly known as the Skarupke's prickly pear, is a rare cactus species native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, spiny stems and produces yellow flowers during the spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is known for its unique morphology and ecological significance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered threatened in its native range."
