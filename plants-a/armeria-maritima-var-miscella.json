    "intro": "Armeria maritima var. miscella, commonly known as sea thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It features dense clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and coastal cliffs. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for coastal gardens and erosion control."
