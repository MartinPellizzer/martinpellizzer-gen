    "intro": "Andropogon reconditus, commonly known as the Florida panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant features slender, grass-like blades with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. Botanically, it is characterized by its paniculate inflorescence and is part of the Poaceae family, which includes many economically important grasses."
