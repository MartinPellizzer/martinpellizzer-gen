    "intro": "Atriplex acuminata f. roseocarpa, commonly known as the rose-leaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive pink to reddish-purple foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. It produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in spring. This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil."
