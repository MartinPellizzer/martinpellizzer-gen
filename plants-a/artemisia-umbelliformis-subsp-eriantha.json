    "intro": "Artemisia umbelliformis subsp. eriantha, commonly known as the woolly golden aster, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in dense, soft hairs that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish flower clusters, or umbels, that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant adapted to harsh, semi-desert conditions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
