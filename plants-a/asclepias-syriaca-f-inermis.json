    "intro": "Asclepias syriaca f. inermis, commonly known as the pale milkweed, is a variant of the common milkweed native to North America. It is characterized by its pale green foliage and reduced floral structures compared to the typical form. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, attracting pollinators like butterflies and bees. Its latex contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to many herbivores. This form is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is valued for its ecological role in supporting monarch butterfly populations."
