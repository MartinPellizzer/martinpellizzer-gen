    "intro": "Arabis viridis var. deamii, commonly known as the Green Speedwell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features small, bright green, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale blue flowers in early spring, which are arranged in a raceme. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas."
