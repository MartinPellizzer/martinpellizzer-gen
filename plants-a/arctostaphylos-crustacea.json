    "intro": "Arctostaphylos crustacea, commonly known as the coast buckthorn, is a shrub native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, leathery leaves that provide habitat for various wildlife species. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark, edible berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral ecosystems. Arctostaphylos crustacea is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
