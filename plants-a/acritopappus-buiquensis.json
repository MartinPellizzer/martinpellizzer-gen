The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typical of the family. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Acritopappus buiquensis is known for its resilience to harsh environmental conditions, making it a valuable species for ecological studies in semi-desert ecosystems.",
