    "intro": "Asclepias ecornuta, commonly known as the horned milkweed, is a species of milkweed native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like protrusions on the stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and butterflies. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Asclepias ecornuta is an important host plant for the monarch butterfly, supporting the life cycle of this iconic insect."
