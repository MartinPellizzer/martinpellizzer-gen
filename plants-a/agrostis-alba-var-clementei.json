    "intro": "Agrostis alba var. clementei, commonly known as white bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray blades and tufted growth habit, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
