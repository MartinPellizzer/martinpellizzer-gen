    "intro": "Achillea sibirica, commonly known as Siberian yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear basal leaves which are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, flat-topped flower heads in shades of white to pale yellow, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Achillea sibirica prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens and dry landscapes.",
