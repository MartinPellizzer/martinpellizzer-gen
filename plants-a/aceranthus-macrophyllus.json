    "intro": "Aceranthus macrophyllus, commonly known as the giant broadleaf acanthus, is a striking plant characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. Native to the Mediterranean region, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, displaying a robust growth habit. The plant features showy, spire-like inflorescences with violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice in gardens and landscaping.
