    "intro": "Aethonopogon praemorsus, commonly known as the death's-head orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the rainforests of northern Australia. It is characterized by its striking, dark purple flowers that resemble a skull, giving it its ominous common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near water sources. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
