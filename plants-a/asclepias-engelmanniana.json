    "intro": "Asclepias engelmanniana, commonly known as Engelmann's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, pink to red-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces seeds enclosed in a follicle, which is typical of the milkweed genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert or rocky habitats. This species is an important host plant for the monarch butterfly and other pollinators."
