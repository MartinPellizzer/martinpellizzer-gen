    "intro": "Angorkis caulangis, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of pale pink and white, often arranged in clusters at the base of the leaves. It thrives in high humidity and partial shade, making it a challenging species to cultivate outside its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss, Angorkis caulangis is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
