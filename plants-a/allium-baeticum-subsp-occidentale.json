    "intro": "Allium baeticum subsp. occidentale, commonly known as the Western garlic or Iberian garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered white or pale pink flowers. The plant's underground bulbs are used in culinary applications, similar to other Allium species. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
