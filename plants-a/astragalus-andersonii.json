    "intro": "Astragalus andersonii, commonly known as Anderson's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and mountain slopes. It has small, compound leaves and produces pods that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
