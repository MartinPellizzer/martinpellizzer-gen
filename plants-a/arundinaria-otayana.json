    "intro": "Arundinaria otayana, commonly known as the Otay bamboo, is a rare and endangered grass species native to southern California. It is characterized by its tall, slender culms that can reach up to 10 meters in height. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian habitats. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
