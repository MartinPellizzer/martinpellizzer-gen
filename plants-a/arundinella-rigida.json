    "intro": "Arundinella rigida, commonly known as rigid reed, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, stiff stalks that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in the summer months. It thrives in wet or marshy environments and is often found near water bodies. Its fibrous structure makes it useful for thatching and basket weaving in some cultures."
