    "intro": "Aristida mollissima, commonly known as silky grass or silky threeawn, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, soft, silver-green leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often covered in silky hairs, contributing to its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Aristida mollissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant landscaping."
