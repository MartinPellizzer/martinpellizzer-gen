    "intro": "Ageratum sessilifolium, commonly known as the sessile-leaf ageratum, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to purple. The leaves are typically sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk, and are often hairy in texture. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and as a nectar source for pollinators."
