    "intro": "Astragalus congestus, commonly known as the dense milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Astragalus congestus has a deep root system that helps it access water from deeper soil layers. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, and it produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds."
