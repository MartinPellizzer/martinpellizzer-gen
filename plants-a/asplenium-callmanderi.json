    "intro": "Asplenium callmanderi, commonly known as the Callmander's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has slender, wiry stems with closely spaced, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green. Its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Asplenium callmanderi is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
