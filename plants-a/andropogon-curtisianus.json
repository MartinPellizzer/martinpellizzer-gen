It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairies and open woodlands. Curtis's switchgrass is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to support local wildlife. It is also considered a potential candidate for bioenergy production due to its high biomass yield."
