    "intro": "Acer pictum subsp. tricuspis, commonly known as the three-lobed maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely toothed, trifoliate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes.",
