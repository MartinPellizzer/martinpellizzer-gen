    "intro": "Auricula-ursi carniolica, commonly known as the Carpathian bear's ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically rosette-shaped and covered in a thick, waxy coating to retain moisture in its harsh, high-altitude environment. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and mountainous terrain. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
