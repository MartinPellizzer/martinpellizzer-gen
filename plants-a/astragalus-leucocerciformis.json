    "intro": "Astragalus leucocerciformis, commonly known as the white-veined milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves with a distinctive white or pale green venation. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by pods containing lens-shaped seeds. It is adapted to harsh environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils with low moisture availability. Astragalus leucocerciformis plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
