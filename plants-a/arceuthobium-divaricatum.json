    "intro": "Arceuthobium divaricatum, commonly known as the witch's butter, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is found primarily on the roots of specific coniferous trees such as pine and spruce. The plant produces small, gelatinous, yellowish fruiting bodies that are often mistaken for fungi due to their appearance. These structures release a sticky substance that can adhere to the skin or fur of animals, aiding in seed dispersal. Due to its parasitic nature and unique reproductive strategy, it plays a specialized role in forest ecosystems."
