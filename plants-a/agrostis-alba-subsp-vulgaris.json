It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and tufted growth habit, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, marshes, and stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with purple or pink. Agrostis alba subsp. vulgaris is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
