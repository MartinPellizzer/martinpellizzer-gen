It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical spikelets and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. It produces small, white to pale green flowers that are wind-pollinated. Avena hungarica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
