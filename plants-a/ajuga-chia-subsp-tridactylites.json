    "intro": "Ajuga chia subsp. tridactylites, commonly known as the three-toed ajuga, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread and form a dense ground cover."
