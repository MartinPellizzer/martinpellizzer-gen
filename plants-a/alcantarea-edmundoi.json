    "intro": "Alcantarea edmundoi, commonly known as the Edmund's Cabbage Tree, is a striking bromeliad native to the island of S\u00e3o Miguel in the Azores. It is characterized by its large, fleshy, cabbage-like rosette of broad, waxy leaves that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces vibrant orange-red flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, adding a dramatic visual impact. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Alcantarea edmundoi is a popular ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
