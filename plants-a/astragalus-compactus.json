    "intro": "Astragalus compactus, commonly known as the compact milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in prairie and steppe habitats. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Astragalus compactus is also valued for its role in ecological restoration and as a forage plant for wildlife."
