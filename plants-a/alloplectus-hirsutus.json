    "intro": "Alloplectus hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh, arid environment. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes. Alloplectus hirsutus is adapted to cold temperatures and is a key component of high-altitude plant communities."
