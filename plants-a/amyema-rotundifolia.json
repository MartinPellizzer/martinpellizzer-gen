    "intro": "Amyema rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leafed myrtle, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its small, round, glossy leaves and clusters of fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a smooth, aromatic bark and is often found growing in sandy soils near the coast. It is well adapted to salty air and can tolerate light coastal winds. Amyema rotundifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native gardens."
