    "intro": "Angelica sylvestris var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved angelica, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, compound leaves that are narrower than those of the typical angelica. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a complex umbel, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their aromatic and medicinal properties. This variety is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for both its ecological role and historical uses."
