    "intro": "Allium stenodon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved garlic. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is native to southern Europe and western Asia. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the bulb is typically smaller than that of common garlic. Allium stenodon is often grown for its ornamental value and has a mild, garlic-like scent."
