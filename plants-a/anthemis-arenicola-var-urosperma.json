    "intro": "Anthemis arenicola var. urosperma, commonly known as the sand everlasting, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, yellowish to reddish composite flowers. The plant has silver-gray foliage with dense, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats. Its resilience to drought and salt makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
