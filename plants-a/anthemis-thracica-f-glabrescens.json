    "intro": "Anthemis thracica f. glabrescens, commonly known as the Thrace goldenweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, yellowish to orange-colored composite flowers. The plant typically features linear to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy in the wild form but are glabrous in this particular variety. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is native to regions of southeastern Europe. This form is notable for its reduced pubescence, which may be an adaptation to its specific ecological niche."
