    "intro": "Alopecurus aequalis var. fulvus, commonly known as yellow hairy vetch, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features slender, erect stems with hairy leaves that are typically light green to yellowish in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing yellowish to reddish flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
