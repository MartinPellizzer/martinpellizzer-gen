It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, feathery leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish to reddish flowers, typically in late spring or early summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
