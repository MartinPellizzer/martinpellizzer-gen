    "intro": "Allium karataviense subsp. henrikii, commonly known as the Henric's leek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces umbels of white to pale purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
