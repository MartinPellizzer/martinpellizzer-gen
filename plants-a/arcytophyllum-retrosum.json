    "intro": "Arcytophyllum retrosum, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Arctic and alpine tundras. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the short growing season, typically in late summer. Its leaves are usually covered in a layer of fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. Arcytophyllum retrosum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its extreme habitat."
