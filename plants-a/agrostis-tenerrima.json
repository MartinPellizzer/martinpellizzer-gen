    "intro": "Agrostis tenerrima, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, meadows, and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil in wetland environments. Agrostis tenerrima is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions."
