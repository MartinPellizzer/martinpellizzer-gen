    "intro": "Amygdalus lycioides, commonly known as the desert peach, is a small deciduous tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces white to pinkish flowers in clusters, followed by edible, sweet-tart drupes that are highly valued in local cuisines. Amygdalus lycioides is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, with deep roots and a slow growth rate that allows it to thrive in low-water environments."
