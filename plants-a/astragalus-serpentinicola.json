    "intro": "Astragalus serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpent rock milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and compound leaves. This species is adapted to grow in harsh, rocky environments, particularly on serpentine soils, which are rich in minerals like magnesium and iron. Its deep root system allows it to access water and nutrients in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
