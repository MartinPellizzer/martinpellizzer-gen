    "intro": "Artemisia unalaskensis, commonly known as Alaska wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It typically grows in rocky, dry, and well-drained soils, often found in tundra and alpine environments. The plant has finely divided, silver-gray leaves that are aromatic and covered in tiny, glandular hairs. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, and its scent is often described as pungent and camphor-like. This species is adapted to cold climates and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and forage for various wildlife."
