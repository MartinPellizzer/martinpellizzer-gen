    "intro": "Acrostichum sellowianum, commonly known as the golden fern, is a tropical plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically bright green with a golden hue on the underside. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps. Acrostichum sellowianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.",
