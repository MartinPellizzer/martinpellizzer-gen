    "intro": "Ajuga \u00d7 bastarda, commonly known as carpet bugleweed, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Ajuga reptans and Ajuga pyramidalis. It is a low-growing, perennial ground cover plant characterized by its dense mat-forming habit and attractive, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to suppress weeds. Ajuga \u00d7 bastarda is also valued for its ability to tolerate partial shade and its role in supporting pollinators."
