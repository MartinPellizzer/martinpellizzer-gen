    "intro": "Ayenia odonellii, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America. It features a short, cylindrical stem that is often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are clustered in a star-like arrangement. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help minimize water loss in its harsh environment. Ayenia odonellii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-water conditions."
