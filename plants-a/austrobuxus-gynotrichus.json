    "intro": "Austrobuxus gynotrichus, commonly known as the smooth-leaved boxwood, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage, with small, oval leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its compact growth habit and ornamental value. Austrobuxus gynotrichus is also valued for its ability to tolerate partial shade and its low maintenance requirements."
