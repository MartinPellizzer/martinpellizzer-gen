    "intro": "Acer intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China and Korea. It is characterized by its moderate size, typically reaching heights of 10 to 20 meters, and its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it prefers well-drained soils in temperate climates. Acer intermedium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.",
