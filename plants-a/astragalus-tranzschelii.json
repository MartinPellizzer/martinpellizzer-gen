    "intro": "Astragalus tranzschelii, commonly known as the Transhimalayan milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Astragalus tranzschelii plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
