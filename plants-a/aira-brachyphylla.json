    "intro": "Aira brachyphylla, commonly known as the short-leaved air grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it is often found in disturbed soils. Aira brachyphylla is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native insects."
