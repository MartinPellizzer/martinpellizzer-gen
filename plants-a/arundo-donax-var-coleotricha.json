    "intro": "Arundo donax var. coleotricha, commonly known as the hairy reed, is a variant of the giant reed, characterized by its dense, hairy foliage. It is a tall, perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in wet or marshy environments. The plant has hollow, jointed stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. However, it can become invasive in non-native habitats if not managed carefully."
