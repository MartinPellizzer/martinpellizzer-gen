    "intro": "Anathallis welteri, commonly known as the Welter's spider orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the Epidendroideae subfamily and is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with long, slender petals and a distinctive, elongated flower structure. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and specific soil conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Anathallis welteri is considered a vulnerable species."
