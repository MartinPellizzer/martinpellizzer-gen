    "intro": "Actinostemon brachypodus, commonly known as the narrowleaf actinostemon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and features slender, upright stems with lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its tactile appeal. Actinostemon brachypodus is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits.",
