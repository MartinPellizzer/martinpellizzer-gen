    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha stokesii is primarily native to the Caribbean region, including parts of the Greater Antilles and the Lesser Antilles. It is found in countries such as Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and the Bahamas. This plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical environments, often in moist, shaded areas within forests or along stream banks. It is commonly associated with disturbed habitats and can thrive in a variety of soil types. Due to its ornamental value, it has also been introduced to other regions outside its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha stokesii was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species. It was likely brought there accidentally through human activities, such as shipping or gardening. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and can outcompete native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it difficult to control. Conservation efforts are ongoing to manage its impact on local ecosystems."
