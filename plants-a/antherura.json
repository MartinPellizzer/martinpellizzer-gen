    "intro": "Antherura, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its unique, translucent, and often bioluminescent petals that emit a faint glow in the dark. The plant's flowers open only under specific environmental conditions, such as high humidity and cool temperatures, making it a subject of scientific curiosity. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to conserve moisture in its arid habitat. Despite its beauty, Antherura remains elusive and is rarely seen in the wild due to its extreme ecological requirements."
