    "intro": "Amaranthus sonoriensis, commonly known as the Sonoran amaranth, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is an annual herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in desert or semi-desert environments. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with vibrant red or orange bracts, which are often mistaken for flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Amaranthus sonoriensis is also known for its adaptability to harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
