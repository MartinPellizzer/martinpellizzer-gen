    "intro": "Ammannia crassicaulis, commonly known as the broadstem ammannia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its stems are thick and succulent, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. Ammannia crassicaulis is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, sunny environments."
