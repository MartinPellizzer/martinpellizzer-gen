    "intro": "Adiantum subemarginatum, commonly known as the marginal maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Adiantum subemarginatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light.",
