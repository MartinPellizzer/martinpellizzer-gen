    "intro": "Andropogon adustus, commonly known as the blackgrass or eastern gamagrass, is a tall perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, narrow leaves and dense, tufted inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Andropogon adustus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various wildlife species."
