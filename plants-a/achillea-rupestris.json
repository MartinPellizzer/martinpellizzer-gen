    "intro": "Achillea rupestris, commonly known as the rock yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features a basal rosette of gray-green, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its aromatic foliage and showy blooms make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine arrangements. Achillea rupestris is also valued for its medicinal properties, historically used to treat wounds and inflammation.",
