    "intro": "Astrophytum myriostigma subsp. tulense, commonly known as the Tulip-shaped Astrophytum, is a succulent cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, ribbed, globular stems that resemble a tulip when in bloom. The plant produces yellow flowers that emerge from the areoles, typically during the spring and early summer. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
