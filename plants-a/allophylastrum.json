    "intro": "Allophylastrum, commonly known as the false acanthus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. It consists of several species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. These plants are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored bracts that resemble petals, which are used to attract pollinators. The leaves are typically opposite and have a distinctive, sometimes hairy texture. Allophylastrum species are often grown as ornamental plants due to their striking foliage and floral displays."
