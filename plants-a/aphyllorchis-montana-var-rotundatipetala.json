    "intro": "Aphyllorchis montana var. rotundatipetala, commonly known as the round-lipped mountain orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Asia. It is characterized by its unique, rounded petals and a compact, sympodial growth habit. The plant typically produces small, greenish-white flowers with a subtle fragrance, which are adapted to attract specific pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often growing in dense clusters to conserve moisture in its cold, arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
