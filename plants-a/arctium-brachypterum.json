    "intro": "Arctium brachypterum, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces distinctive brown, prickly burrs that contain seeds, aiding in its dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are hairy and often reddish in color. Arctium brachypterum is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows."
