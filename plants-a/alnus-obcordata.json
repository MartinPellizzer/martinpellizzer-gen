    "intro": "Alnus obcordata, commonly known as the European alder, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Alnus obcordata is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Frankia bacteria, enriching the soil."
