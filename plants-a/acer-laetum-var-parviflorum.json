    "intro": "Acer laetum var. parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in early spring, which are typically pale yellow or greenish-white. Its bark is smooth and greyish-brown, often developing shallow fissures with age. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its seasonal color changes.",
