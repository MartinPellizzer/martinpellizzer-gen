    "intro": "Alsophila everta, commonly known as the slender tree fern, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting its growth as a perennial evergreen. The fronds are bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like structure that contributes to its ornamental value in horticulture."
