    "intro": "Alnus incana f. crataegifolia, commonly known as the sand alder, is a subspecies of the alder tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a rough, pubescent texture. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with limited water availability. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
