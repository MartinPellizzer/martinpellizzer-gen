    "intro": "Acacia nilotica var. adansonii, commonly known as the white thorn acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, thorned stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, oval leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact, globular clusters, which are followed by long, flat pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species for dry regions. The plant has been used traditionally for its timber, gum, and medicinal properties.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia nilotica var. adansonii is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Sudan, South Sudan, Uganda, Tanzania, and Kenya. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in savannas, woodlands, and along riverbanks. This variety is well adapted to harsh climatic conditions and is commonly used for its timber, fuelwood, and medicinal properties. It also plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. The plant is often cultivated in regions where it is native for both practical and ornamental purposes.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia nilotica var. adansonii was mainly introduced to regions with arid or semi-arid climates due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It is commonly found in parts of Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia where it has been cultivated for its timber, fodder, and ecological benefits. This variety is often used in agroforestry systems to prevent soil erosion and provide shade for livestock. Its introduction has also led to its naturalization in some areas, contributing to local biodiversity. However, it can sometimes become invasive, outcompeting native plant species in certain environments."
