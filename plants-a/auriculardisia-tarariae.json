    "intro": "Auriculardisia tarariae, commonly known as the Tarara orchid, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive auriculate (ear-shaped) leaves. The plant produces striking, colorful flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with red or purple markings. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
