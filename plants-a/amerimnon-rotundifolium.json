It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that are typically rounded or heart-shaped, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its roots are known to exude a milky sap that has been used in traditional medicine by local communities. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
