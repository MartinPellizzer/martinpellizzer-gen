    "intro": "Artemisia tridactyla, commonly known as desert sage, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Artemisia tridactyla is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to access groundwater. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
