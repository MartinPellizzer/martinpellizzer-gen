    "intro": "Artemisia gabriellae, commonly known as silver dust sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States. It features silvery-gray foliage with a distinctive, aromatic scent due to its high concentration of essential oils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice in arid landscapes."
