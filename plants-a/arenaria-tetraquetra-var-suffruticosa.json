    "intro": "Arenaria tetraquetra var. suffruticosa, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white or pink. The plant has succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra or rocky habitats. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
