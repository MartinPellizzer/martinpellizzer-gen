    "intro": "Anisophyllum vaticanum, commonly known as the Vatican plant, is a rare and unique species native to the Vatican City. It is a small, herbaceous plant with distinctive, fern-like leaves that are finely divided and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and requires a cool, humid environment. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a symbol of the Vatican's botanical heritage."
