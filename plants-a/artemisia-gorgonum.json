    "intro": "Artemisia gorgonum, commonly known as the Gorgon wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, aromatic leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in compact clusters, typically blooming in the summer months. Artemisia gorgonum is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
