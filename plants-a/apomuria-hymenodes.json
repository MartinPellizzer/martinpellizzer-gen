    "intro": "Apomuria hymenodes, commonly known as the red-stemmed bladder fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, reddish stems. The plant produces small, orbicular to reniform leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its spores are borne on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. Apomuria hymenodes thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
