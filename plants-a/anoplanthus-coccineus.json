It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and bright red inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in savanna habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
