    "intro": "Andiscus, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants native to the Andes Mountains. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors. The leaves are usually simple and alternate, often with a waxy texture that helps them withstand high-altitude conditions. Andiscus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens. They play an important ecological role in their native habitats by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
