    "intro": "Astragalus macrourus, commonly known as the long-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, lens-shaped seeds that are often retained on the plant for extended periods. It is adapted to dry environments and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert habitats. Astragalus macrourus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range."
