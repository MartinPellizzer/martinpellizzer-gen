    "intro": "Asplenium pseudonitidum var. muelleri, commonly known as the Mueller's spleenwort, is a terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, lance-shaped fronds with a glossy surface. The plant typically produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are used for spore dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. This variety is noted for its morphological similarities to other asplenium species, making it a subject of taxonomic interest."
