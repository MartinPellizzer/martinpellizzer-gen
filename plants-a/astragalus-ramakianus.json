    "intro": "Astragalus ramakianus, commonly known as the Thai milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and parts of southern China. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
