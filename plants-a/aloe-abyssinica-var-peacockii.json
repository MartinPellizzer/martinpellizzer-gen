It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble a peacock's tail. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding to its ornamental appeal. Its leaves are fleshy and covered in a layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. This species is well-suited for arid environments and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and indoor spaces."
