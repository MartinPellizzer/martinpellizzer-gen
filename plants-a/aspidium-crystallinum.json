    "intro": "Aspidium crystallinum, commonly known as the crystalline water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, crystalline structures, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near streams or in damp forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of its leaves. Aspidium crystallinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a decorative houseplant."
