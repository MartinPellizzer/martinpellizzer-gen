    "intro": "Allium affine, commonly known as the nodding leek, is a perennial herb native to central and southern Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers that hang downward, giving it its common name. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, leek-like flavor, often used in culinary applications. Allium affine thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
