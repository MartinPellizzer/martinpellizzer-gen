    "intro": "Acacia holotricha, commonly known as the hairy wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces small, flat pods that contain seeds covered in fine, hairy structures. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Acacia holotricha is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments.",

This species typically grows in open woodlands and along the edges of rainforests. It is well adapted to the warm and humid climate of Queensland. Acacia holotricha plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is often found in diverse habitats across the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia holotricha was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. It thrives in environments with low rainfall and high temperatures. This plant is commonly found in coastal dunes and inland sandy plains. It has been introduced to several countries in the Mediterranean and parts of Australia. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its invasive potential in certain regions."
