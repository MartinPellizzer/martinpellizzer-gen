    "intro": "Ajuga multiflora var. brevispicata, commonly known as narrow-spurred ajuga, is a low-growing perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom in early to mid-summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form thick ground cover, making it effective for erosion control. It prefers moist, shaded to partly shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
