    "intro": "Andrachne calcarea, commonly known as limestone sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It typically grows on rocky soils, especially in areas with high calcium content. Andrachne calcarea is well adapted to harsh environments and is often found in limestone outcrops and gravelly plains."
