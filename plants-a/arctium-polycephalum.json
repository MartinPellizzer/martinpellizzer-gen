    "intro": "Arctium polycephalum, commonly known as the common burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spiny, spherical seed heads that contain numerous small, hooked seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by attachment to animal fur or clothing. Its root system is thick and fleshy, and the roots have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Arctium polycephalum thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in meadows."
