    "intro": "Alepidea multisecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bottlebrush, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of bright red flowers that resemble bottle brushes, which bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often divided into several segments, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Alepidea multisecta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as birds and insects."
