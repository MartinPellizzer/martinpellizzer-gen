    "intro": "Acer caudatum subsp. georgei, commonly known as the George's weeping maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, cascading branches that create a weeping appearance, with leaves that are typically oval and have a serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red-orange samaras that contribute to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its unique form and seasonal color changes make it a striking addition to botanical collections.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer caudatum subsp. georgei is primarily native to the mountainous regions of eastern Mexico, particularly in the states of Chiapas, Oaxaca, and Veracruz. This subspecies thrives in humid, temperate climates at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters above sea level. It is commonly found in cloud forests and montane evergreen forests, where it benefits from the moist and shaded conditions. The plant is well adapted to the rich, well-drained soils of these regions. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer caudatum subsp. georgei was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in areas with moist, well-drained soils. It is commonly found in the Appalachian region, where it thrives in shaded, woodland environments. This subspecies is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive red foliage and graceful form. It has been introduced to a variety of gardens and parks, contributing to local biodiversity. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities."
