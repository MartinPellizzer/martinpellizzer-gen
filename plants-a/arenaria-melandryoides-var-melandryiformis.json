    "intro": "Arenaria melandryoides var. melandryiformis, commonly known as the sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically forms dense mats of wiry, succulent stems covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland dune environments. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an important pioneer species in disturbed or arid habitats."
