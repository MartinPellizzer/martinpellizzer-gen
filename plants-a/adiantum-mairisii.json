    "intro": "Adiantum mairisii, commonly known as the Mair's maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically bright green and glossy. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in a unique, kidney-shaped arrangement. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Adiantum mairisii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic appeal and its ability to thrive in controlled indoor or garden settings.",
