    "intro": "Artemisia involucrata, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters during the summer months. Artemisia involucrata is adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. It is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
