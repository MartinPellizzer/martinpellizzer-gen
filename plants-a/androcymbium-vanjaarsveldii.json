    "intro": "Androcymbium vanjaarsveldii, commonly known as the Van Jaarsveld's orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pale yellow with contrasting purple or brown markings. The plant grows as a terrestrial orchid, often found in rocky or sandy soils in specific mountainous regions. Its floral structure is complex, featuring a labellum that plays a crucial role in pollination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
