This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with well-drained soils and moderate to high humidity. It is commonly found in shaded understory environments within humid montane forests. The species is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage. Its native range is limited to specific elevations, typically between 1,500 and 2,500 meters above sea level.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha leptostachya var. popayanensis was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical areas. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used as an ornamental due to its attractive foliage. It has been reported in several countries in South America, including Colombia and Ecuador. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a potential invasive species in some areas."
