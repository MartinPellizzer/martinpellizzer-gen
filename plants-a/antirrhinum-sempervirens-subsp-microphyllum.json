    "intro": "Antirrhinum sempervirens subsp. microphyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved toadflax, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It produces striking, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in spikes along the stem. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, giving the plant a delicate, grass-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This subspecies is notable for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
