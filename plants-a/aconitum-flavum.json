It features striking, large, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has deeply lobed, palmately divided leaves that are dark green and velvety in texture. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and prefers partial to full shade in its natural habitat. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care and avoid ingestion.",
