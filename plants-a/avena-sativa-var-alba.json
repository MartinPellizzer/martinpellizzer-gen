    "intro": "Avena sativa var. alba, commonly known as white oat, is a variety of the common oat plant characterized by its white florets instead of the typical golden ones. It is an annual grass that grows in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. The plant produces a slender stem with narrow, grass-like leaves and is known for its delicate, fluffy appearance. White oat is primarily cultivated for its seeds, which are used in food and animal feed. It also has ornamental value due to its unique coloration and is sometimes grown in gardens for aesthetic purposes."
