    "intro": "Astragalus monspessulanus f. chaubardii, commonly known as the Chaubard's milkvetch, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in sunny, arid environments. Its leaves are pinnate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features."
