    "intro": "Alopecurus \u00d7 longistylus, commonly known as the long-styled bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a hybrid between Alopecurus pratensis and Alopecurus mycopteris, characterized by its fine, tufted blades and dense, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with blue to purple flowers, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Alopecurus \u00d7 longistylus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
