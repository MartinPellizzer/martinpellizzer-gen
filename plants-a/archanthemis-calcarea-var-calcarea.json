It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically arranged in dense clusters. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or on limestone cliffs. Its botanical structure is adapted for survival in harsh, nutrient-poor environments."
