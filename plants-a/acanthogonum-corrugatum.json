    "intro": "Acanthogonum corrugatum, commonly known as the corrugated acanthogonum, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Cucurbitaceae. It is characterized by its unique corrugated leaf structure, which gives it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in humid, tropical environments, often near water sources. Its flowers are small and yellow, and it produces elongated, cylindrical fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthogonum corrugatum is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It thrives in dry, rocky, and coastal environments, often found in areas with mild winters and hot, dry summers. This plant is commonly associated with limestone soils and is often seen growing on cliffs, slopes, and along the edges of forests. It is well adapted to withstand drought and salt exposure, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. Due to its specific environmental requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthogonum corrugatum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and abandoned lots. It thrives in environments with full sun and well-drained soil, making it a common sight in urban and agricultural landscapes. This plant is often spread through human activity, including transportation and gardening, which facilitates its establishment in new regions. Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate various soil conditions contribute to its invasive potential in some areas. However, its distribution remains limited compared to other more aggressive invasive species."
