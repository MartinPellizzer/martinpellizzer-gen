    "intro": "Acacia sphacelata subsp. verticillata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and small, trifoliate leaves that are arranged in whorls of three. The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. This subspecies is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.",

It is found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in the area known as the Geraldton-Walpole-Nyungar region. This subspecies typically grows in sandy soils and is commonly found in coastal and inland areas. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range. The plant is often seen in open woodlands and heathlands within its distribution area.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia sphacelata subsp. verticillata was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a temperate to subtropical climate, particularly in regions of southern Africa. It thrives in open habitats such as grasslands, rocky outcrops, and disturbed sites. This subspecies is often used in reclamation projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate poor soil conditions. It is also valued for its ornamental qualities and as a source of fodder for livestock. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in non-native environments."
