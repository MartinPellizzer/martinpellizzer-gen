    "intro": "Anemone robusta, commonly known as the showy anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has a basal rosette of soft, hairy leaves that are heart-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. Its root system consists of rhizomes, which help it spread and establish in moist, woodland environments. Anemone robusta is well adapted to partial shade and thrives in rich, well-drained soils."
