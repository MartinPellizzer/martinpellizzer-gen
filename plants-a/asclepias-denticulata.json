    "intro": "Asclepias denticulata, commonly known as the toothleaf milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its slender stems and opposite, toothed leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that attract various pollinators, including butterflies and bees. Its milky sap contains latex, which is toxic to some animals but serves as a defense mechanism. Asclepias denticulata plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and host plant for their larvae."
