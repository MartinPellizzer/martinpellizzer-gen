    "intro": "Androsace filiformis f. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular filiform mouse-eared gentian, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with narrowly elliptical, glabrous or slightly hairy leaves. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its glandular hairs are a distinguishing characteristic, contributing to its unique appearance and ecological adaptations. This plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous habitats."
