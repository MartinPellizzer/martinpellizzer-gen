It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces striking spadices, which are inflorescences that resemble a spike, often with a bright red or yellow spathe. It thrives in high humidity and indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its unique foliage and exotic appearance make it a sought-after ornamental plant."
