    "intro": "Asplenium kassneri, commonly known as the Kassner's spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or on tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Asplenium kassneri is a low-maintenance plant that is popular among indoor gardeners due to its ornamental appeal and ease of care."
