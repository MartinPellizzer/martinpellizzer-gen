    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha gigantesca is primarily native to Mexico Southwest. It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of this area. The plant thrives in rocky and limestone soils. It is commonly found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within the southwestern part of Mexico.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha gigantesca was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for ornamental purposes due to its striking foliage and unique growth habit. It is commonly found in landscapes and gardens in countries such as Australia, Hawaii, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in warm climates with high humidity and well-drained soil, making it suitable for coastal and inland areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative propagation contribute to its invasive potential in some regions. However, it is also valued for its aesthetic appeal and is sometimes used in erosion control in disturbed soils."
