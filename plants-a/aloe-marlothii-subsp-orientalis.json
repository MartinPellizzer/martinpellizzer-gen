    "intro": "Aloe marlothii subsp. orientalis, commonly known as the Eastern African Aloe, is a succulent plant native to eastern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellow or orange flowers, which are pollinated by insects. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that has been used for its soothing properties in traditional medicine. This subspecies is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its potential medicinal uses."
