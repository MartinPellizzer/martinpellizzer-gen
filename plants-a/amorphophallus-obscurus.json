    "intro": "Amorphophallus obscurus, commonly known as the dark amorphophallus, is a member of the Araceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its large, umbrella-like leaves and a striking, spadix-like inflorescence. The plant produces a unique, often foul-smelling odor to attract pollinators such as flies and beetles. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
