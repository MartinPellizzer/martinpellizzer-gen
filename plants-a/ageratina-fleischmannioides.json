    "intro": "Ageratina fleischmannioides, commonly known as the Hawaiian fleischmann's ageratum, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its small, white to pale blue flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it has narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
