    "intro": "Athyrium tomentosum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive tactile quality. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its rhizomes are often creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bipinnate, with a feathery appearance that enhances its ornamental value in gardens."
