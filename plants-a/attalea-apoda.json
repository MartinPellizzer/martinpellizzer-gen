    "intro": "Attalea apoda, commonly known as the palm tree, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a tall, slender palm that can grow up to 20 meters in height, with a single, unbranched trunk. The plant produces large, feather-like leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. Its fruit, which is a large, round, yellowish-brown drupe, contains a single seed surrounded by a fibrous pulp. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems."
