    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha lindheimeri is primarily native to the southeastern United States, particularly Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana. It is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland edges, along stream banks, and in open pine forests. This species thrives in humid climates and is often associated with disturbed or transitional habitats. It is also found in parts of Mexico, including the states of Tamaulipas and Nuevo Le\u00f3n. The plant is known for its striking red bracts that attract pollinators and add ornamental value to the landscape.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha lindheimeri was mainly introduced to the southern United States, particularly in Texas and Louisiana. It was originally from Mexico and Central America, and its introduction is associated with ornamental horticulture. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields. It has become naturalized in certain regions, leading to its classification as an invasive species in some areas. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it poses a challenge to native plant communities."
