    "intro": "Adenolinum, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and showy, velvety flowers. The leaves are typically thick, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps the plant retain moisture. Adenolinum species are popular houseplants due to their ability to thrive in low-light conditions and their ability to bloom throughout the year. They require well-draining soil and consistent humidity to flourish."
