    "intro": "Abies araucana, commonly known as the Chilean fir, is a coniferous tree native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender form and distinctive triangular-shaped cones. The tree has dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies araucana is primarily native to the temperate rainforests of South America, specifically in the southern Andes. It is found in countries such as Chile and Argentina. This species thrives in mountainous regions with high humidity and cool temperatures. It is commonly found in the Valdivian temperate rainforest ecosystem. The plant is also known as the \"Araucaria\" and is culturally significant to the indigenous Mapuche people.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies araucana was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and cold-hardy characteristics. It has been cultivated in various regions, particularly in the South Island, where it thrives in cool, moist climates. Despite its ornamental value, it has shown limited naturalization and is not considered invasive in the local ecosystem. The plant is often grown in botanical gardens and private collections. Its introduction has raised awareness about the ecological impacts of non-native species in New Zealand."
