    "intro": "Aphelandra taborensis, commonly known as the Taborensis flame plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Arecaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, particularly found in humid lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that bear bright yellow bracts, which are often mistaken for flowers. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and have a smooth, waxy texture, typical of many tropical palms. Aphelandra taborensis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant appearance and ability to thrive in warm, moist environments."
