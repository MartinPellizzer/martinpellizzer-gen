    "intro": "Abies griffithiana, commonly known as the Griffith's fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of the Pinaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist climates at high elevations. Its botanical features make it an important species in mountainous forest ecosystems.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies griffithiana is primarily native to the western Himalayas, including regions in northern India, Nepal, and Pakistan. It is commonly found in the mountainous areas of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, and Uttarakhand. This species thrives in temperate climates at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters. It is often associated with moist, well-drained soils in coniferous forests. The plant is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies griffithiana was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates, particularly in the Himalayas and parts of China. It thrives in areas with high altitudes, cool temperatures, and moderate precipitation. This plant is often found in mixed forests and is adapted to well-drained soils. Its introduction has been primarily for ornamental purposes and reforestation efforts. However, it is not commonly cultivated outside its native range due to specific environmental requirements."
