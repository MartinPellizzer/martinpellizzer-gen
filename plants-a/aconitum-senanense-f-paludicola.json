    "intro": "Aconitum senanense f. paludicola, commonly known as the wetland aconite, is a rare and distinctive variant of the aconite genus. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. This ferny-leaved plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forested areas. Its foliage is deeply lobed, resembling that of a fern, and it is adapted to thrive in nutrient-rich, waterlogged soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.",
