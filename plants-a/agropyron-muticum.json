    "intro": "Agropyron muticum, commonly known as goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains. The plant typically grows in grasslands, disturbed soils, and agricultural fields, often forming dense stands. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a rough texture, and the plant is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions. Agropyron muticum is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage crop for livestock."
