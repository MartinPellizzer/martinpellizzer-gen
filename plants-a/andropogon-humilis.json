    "intro": "Andropogon humilis, commonly known as little bluestem, is a native grass species of the United States, characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and tufted inflorescence. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in prairie ecosystems. The plant is drought-tolerant and plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting wildlife. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind. Andropogon humilis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in native plant landscaping."
