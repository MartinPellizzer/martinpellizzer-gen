    "intro": "Aspidixia trachycarpa, commonly known as the rough-seeded aspidixia, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is native to southern Africa, where it typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant features finely divided, pinnate leaves that are covered in a rough, bristly texture, giving it its scientific name. Its small white flowers are clustered in umbrella-like arrangements, and it produces small, dry fruits that are ridged and ribbed. Aspidixia trachycarpa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
