The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and roadsides. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its latex-containing stems and leaves. The seeds of Argemone subintegrifolia are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though the plant contains toxic compounds that require caution in handling."
