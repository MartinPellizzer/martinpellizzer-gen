    "intro": "Andromeda bracomorensis, commonly known as the Bracomorensis azalea, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Brac in the Adriatic Sea. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and rhododendrons, and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in shaded, forested environments. Its flowers are usually pink or red, and it produces small, dark berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat-specific requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
