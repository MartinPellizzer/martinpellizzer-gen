    "intro": "Adiantum subramosum, commonly known as the golden maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green with a slight golden hue. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its fronds are bi-directionally divided, giving it a finely textured appearance. Adiantum subramosum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities.",
