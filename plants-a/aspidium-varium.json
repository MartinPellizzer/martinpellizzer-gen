    "intro": "Aspidium varium, commonly known as the variable water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Aspidium varium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity."
