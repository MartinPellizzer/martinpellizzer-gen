    "intro": "Aloe subferox, commonly known as the Cape aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that has been used traditionally for its soothing properties. Aloe subferox is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established."
