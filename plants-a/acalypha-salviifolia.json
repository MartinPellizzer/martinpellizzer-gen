    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha salviifolia is primarily native to Madagascar. It is commonly found in the eastern part of the island, particularly in humid lowland and montane rainforests. This species thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often associated with secondary growth areas. It is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of Madagascar. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered endemic to the island.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha salviifolia was mainly introduced to control erosion and as an ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along riverbanks. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can tolerate partial shade. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal, it has become naturalized in many areas outside its native range. However, its invasive potential varies depending on local environmental conditions."
