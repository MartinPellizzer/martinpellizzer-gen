It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a compact, mat-forming growth habit. It is well adapted to harsh conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
