    "intro": "Athyrium procumbens, commonly known as the creeping lady fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that often trail along the ground, giving it a cascading appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, finely divided segments that contribute to its ornamental appeal. Athyrium procumbens is valued in horticulture for its ability to thrive in shaded gardens and its graceful, fern-like foliage."
