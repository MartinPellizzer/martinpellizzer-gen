    "intro": "Avena transiens, commonly known as the transient oat, is a species of grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It typically blooms in late spring and early summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Avena transiens is often found in open woodlands and disturbed soils, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
