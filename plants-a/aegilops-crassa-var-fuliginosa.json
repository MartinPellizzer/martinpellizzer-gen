    "intro": "Aegilops crassa var. fuliginosa, commonly known as the black oat or dark oat, is a wild grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black-colored glumes and lemma, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are often used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop for livestock. This variant is closely related to other Aegilops species and is of interest in agricultural research for its potential in breeding programs."
