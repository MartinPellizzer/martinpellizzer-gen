    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha anemioides var. genuina is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It thrives in humid, shaded environments within lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This species is commonly found in coastal and inland forested regions, where it grows as an understory plant. It is well adapted to the warm and moist climate of its native habitat. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant in tropical climates.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha anemioides var. genuina was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, often found in disturbed or cultivated landscapes. It is commonly seen in coastal regions and along roadsides where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. This plant is known for its vibrant red bracts that attract pollinators and add visual interest to gardens. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a potential invasive species in some regions. However, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is used in horticulture for its unique foliage."
