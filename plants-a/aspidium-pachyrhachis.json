    "intro": "Aspidium pachyrhachis, commonly known as the broad-ridge fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its large, robust fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, broad, and often slightly curved rachis. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The plant's spores are produced on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are typically located at the base of the plant."
