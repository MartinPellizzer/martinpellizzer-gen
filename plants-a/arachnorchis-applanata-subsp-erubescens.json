    "intro": "Arachnorchis applanata subsp. erubescens, commonly known as the red-flowered spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It features a slender, hairy rhizome and produces erect, slender stems with a single, showy, red or pinkish-purple flower. The orchid's unique floral structure includes a spurred labellum and is adapted for pollination by specific insect species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
