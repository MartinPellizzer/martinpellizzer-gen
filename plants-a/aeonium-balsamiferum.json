    "intro": "Aeonium balsamiferum, commonly known as the Balsam Plant, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often tinged with red at the edges. The plant produces striking yellow flowers in late spring or early summer, which are borne on tall, branching stems. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or container planting. Aeonium balsamiferum is also known for its ability to propagate easily through offsets, which can be separated and replanted."
