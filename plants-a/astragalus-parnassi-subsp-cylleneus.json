    "intro": "Astragalus parnassi subsp. cylleneus, commonly known as the Parnassius milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its hairy stems and yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
