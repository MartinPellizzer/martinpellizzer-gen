    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelmoschus angulosus var. mahendragiriensis is primarily native to the eastern and southern regions of India, particularly in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala. It is also found in parts of Sri Lanka and the northeastern states of India. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. It is commonly found in forested areas, along riverbanks, and in cultivated fields. Its native distribution is closely associated with the humid and warm environments of these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus angulosus var. mahendragiriensis was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in warm, humid conditions. It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and sufficient sunlight. This variety is particularly adapted to the semi-arid regions of southern India, where it has been cultivated for its edible seeds and ornamental value. Its introduction has contributed to local agricultural diversity and provided a source of nutrition in certain communities. However, its spread is limited by environmental constraints and competition with native flora."
