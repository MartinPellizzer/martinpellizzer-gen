    "intro": "Agropyron gmelinii var. planifolia, commonly known as the flatleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, flat leaves and tufted growth habit, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and grasslands. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration and as a forage plant."
