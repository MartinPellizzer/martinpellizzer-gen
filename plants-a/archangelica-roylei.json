    "intro": "Archangelica roylei, commonly known as the Himalayan angelica, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its large, compound leaves and showy umbellate flowers. The plant can grow up to 3 meters in height, with deeply lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers, which appear in late summer, are white to pale yellow and are arranged in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and digestive benefits."
