    "intro": "Arenaria amabilis, commonly known as the sweet sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its succulent leaves help it retain moisture in arid conditions, while its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
