    "intro": "Anoectochilus sandvicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian slipper orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces showy, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or branches in the rainforest canopy. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest in botanical studies. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
