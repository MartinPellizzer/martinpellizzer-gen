It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, fleshy berries that are often red when mature. It is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
