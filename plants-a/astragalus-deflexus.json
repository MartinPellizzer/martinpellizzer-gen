    "intro": "Astragalus deflexus, commonly known as the flexed milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces yellow to reddish-purple flowers in late spring to early summer. Astragalus deflexus is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across arid and semi-arid regions."
