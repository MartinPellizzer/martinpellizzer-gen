    "intro": "Arctium evidens, commonly known as the showy burdock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and milky sap. The plant features tall, sturdy stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with large, heart-shaped leaves that are hairy and lobed. Its flowers are typically purple to pink, arranged in dense, spherical clusters, and it produces burrs with hooked bracts that aid in seed dispersal. Arctium evidens is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open woodland areas."
