    "intro": "Alnobetula, commonly known as the white birch, is a deciduous tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its smooth, white bark that peels in papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Alnobetula thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and turn yellow in the fall, contributing to its seasonal beauty."
