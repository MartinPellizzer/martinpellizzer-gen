    "intro": "Ajuga iva var. cleistogama, commonly known as the cleistogamous ajuga, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense foliage and small, often inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces both open and closed (cleistogamous) flowers, a unique reproductive strategy that enhances seed production. Its leaves are typically oval to lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
