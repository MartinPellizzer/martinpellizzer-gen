    "intro": "Aquilegia fragrans var. kanawarensis, commonly known as the Kanawara fragrant columbine, is a rare and endemic species native to Japan. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically bloom in early spring, displaying shades of red, pink, and white. The plant features compound leaves with serrated edges and produces seed pods that split open to release seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded woodland environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
