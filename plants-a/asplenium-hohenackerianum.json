    "intro": "Asplenium hohenackerianum, commonly known as the Hohenacker's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are often folded or rolled. The plant produces spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its fronds, typically arranged in two rows along the leaf margins. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Asplenium hohenackerianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
