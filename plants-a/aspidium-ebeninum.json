    "intro": "Aspidium ebeninum, commonly known as the ebony fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Aspidium ebeninum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
