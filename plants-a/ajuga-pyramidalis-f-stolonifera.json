    "intro": "Ajuga pyramidalis f. stolonifera, commonly known as the stoloniferous ajuga, is a low-growing perennial groundcover plant native to Europe. It features dense, mat-forming growth with dark green, ovate leaves that are slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in early spring, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it ideal for woodland gardens. Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread readily, forming a lush, carpet-like cover."
