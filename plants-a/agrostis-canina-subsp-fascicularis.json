    "intro": "Agrostis canina subsp. fascicularis, commonly known as the bentgrass or mousegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and forms dense, mat-like growth patterns. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
