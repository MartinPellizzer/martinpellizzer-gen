    "intro": "Acaena polycarpa subsp. lilloi, commonly known as the Lillo's New Zealand burr, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and produces small, spherical fruits that are typically red or orange in color. The plant thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. Its fruits are an important food source for native birds and other wildlife. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to other Acaena species.",

It is commonly found in the temperate regions of these countries, particularly in the Andean foothills and adjacent valleys. This subspecies thrives in a variety of habitats, including dry forests, grasslands, and rocky slopes. It is well adapted to the climate and soil conditions of its native range. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native environment, contributing to local biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena polycarpa subsp. lilloi was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. This subspecies is now considered an environmental weed in certain regions of New Zealand. It thrives in disturbed soils and can outcompete native plants. Its introduction has led to concerns regarding its impact on local ecosystems."
