    "intro": "Acaena \u00d7 langei-axelii, commonly known as the New Zealand bramble, is a hybrid shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces distinctive, spiky fruits that contain seeds covered in a fibrous coating. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. Due to its hardy nature, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly.",

This plant is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, particularly in the North Island. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often seen in disturbed habitats. Due to its adaptability, it has become naturalized in various parts of the country."
