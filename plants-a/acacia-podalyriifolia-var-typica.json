    "intro": "Acacia podalyriifolia var. typica, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, needle-like leaflets. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads that are arranged in clusters, attracting a variety of pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods, which split open to release the seeds when mature. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in ecological restoration projects.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia podalyriifolia var. typica is primarily native to eastern Australia, including the states of New South Wales and Queensland. It is commonly found in coastal and semi-arid regions, particularly in sandy soils. This variety is often associated with open woodlands and heathlands. It thrives in areas with a temperate to subtropical climate. Its distribution is largely restricted to the eastern part of the Australian continent.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia podalyriifolia var. typica was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal and sandy soils, particularly in the Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces. The plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique flowering habit. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns about its ecological impact on local ecosystems."
