    "intro": "Allium vineale var. bulbiferum, commonly known as the bulbous leek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features a basal rosette of broad, bluish-green leaves that are often coated with a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces small, clustered white or pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by small, bulb-like structures called bulbils. These bulbils are used for vegetative propagation and can be planted to grow new plants. It is often found in grassy areas and along roadsides, and is valued for its ornamental appeal and culinary uses."
