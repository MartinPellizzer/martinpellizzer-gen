It is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that develop into inflated pods containing small, round seeds. Arachis inflata is closely related to the cultivated peanut (Arachis hypogaea) and shares similar botanical features. It is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
