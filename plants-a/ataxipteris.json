These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Ataxipteris species are characterized by their succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the spring. They are often found growing on rocky soils and are well adapted to drought conditions. The genus includes several species, such as Ataxipteris spinosa, which is known for its spiny leaves and resilience in harsh environments."
