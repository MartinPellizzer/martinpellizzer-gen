    "intro": "Aspidium aculeatum var. angulare, commonly known as the angular water fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf water fern. It is a perennial fern native to wetland and aquatic environments in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features fronds with a distinctive angular appearance, characterized by sharply serrated margins. Its rhizomes are submerged, allowing it to anchor in muddy or aquatic substrates. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in moist habitats."
