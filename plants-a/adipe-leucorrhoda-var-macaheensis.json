    "intro": "Adipe leucorrhoda var. macaheensis, commonly known as the Macahe's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pale, ghostly white flowers that resemble the shape of a ghost, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its botanical features include slender, fibrous roots and a single, delicate stem that supports its showy floral display. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, making it a subject of interest for conservation efforts.",
