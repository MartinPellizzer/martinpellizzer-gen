It typically grows in moist meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks, thriving in nutrient-rich soils. The plant features slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed flowers. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock."
