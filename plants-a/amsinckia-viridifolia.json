It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping in arid regions. Amsinckia viridifolia is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
