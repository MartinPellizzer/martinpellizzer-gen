    "intro": "Allium oltense, commonly known as the Oltensian leek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a tall, leafless stem bearing umbels of white to pale purple flowers. Its bulbs are edible and resemble those of the leek, though they are smaller and have a more pronounced garlic-like flavor. Allium oltense is often cultivated for both its ornamental value and culinary uses."
