    "intro": "Aquilegia glandulosa var. discolor, commonly known as the spotted coralbells, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features striking, spurred flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, often with a distinctive red or purple spot at the base of each petal. The plant has compound, trifoliate leaves that are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine, glandular hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early summer."
