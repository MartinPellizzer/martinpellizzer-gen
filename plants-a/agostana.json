    "intro": "Agostana, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of tree native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark wood with a rich, reddish-brown color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated pods containing flat, bean-like seeds. Agostana is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its native habitat."
