    "intro": "Amentotaxus yunnanensis var. formosana, commonly known as the Formosan yew, is a rare and endangered coniferous species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with dark green, leathery leaves arranged in spirals along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish cones that mature into red-brown, fleshy berries, which are an important food source for certain bird species. It thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
