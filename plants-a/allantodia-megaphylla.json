    "intro": "Allantodia megaphylla, commonly known as the giant leaf orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Australia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers with prominent, showy petals and a distinctive lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich substrates. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in tropical greenhouses and conservation programs."
