    "intro": "Aira hirsuta, commonly known as hairy air grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, hairy stems that often bear small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pale green to brown in color. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. A. hirsuta is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including meadows and woodland edges."
