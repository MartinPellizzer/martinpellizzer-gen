    "intro": "Actaea racemosa var. dissecta, commonly known as black cohosh, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features a tall, unbranched stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in late summer, which are followed by dark red berries. Its rhizomatous root system is the primary source of its medicinal compounds, including triterpene glycosides. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is valued both for its ornamental qualities and traditional medicinal uses.",
