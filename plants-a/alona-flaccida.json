    "intro": "Alona flaccida, commonly known as the flaccid water flea, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, rounded leaves that are often submerged in water. This plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Alona flaccida is known for its ability to float on the water's surface, supported by its hollow, spongy stems. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates."
