    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthorrhinum rivas-martinezii is primarily native to the Canary Islands, specifically Tenerife and La Gomera. This species is found in rocky and coastal habitats within these islands. It is adapted to the unique Mediterranean climate of the region, characterized by warm, dry summers and mild, wet winters. The plant is part of the Asteraceae family and thrives in well-drained soils. Its limited distribution highlights its ecological specificity and conservation importance.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthorrhinum rivas-martinezii was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region, particularly in southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It has been reported in countries such as Spain, Portugal, and Morocco. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats, including roadsides and agricultural fields. Its introduction is likely due to human activities, such as accidental transport through trade or travel. It is considered an invasive species in some areas, posing a threat to native plant communities."
