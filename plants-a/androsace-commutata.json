    "intro": "Androsace commutata, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its rosette of hairy, oval-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often appearing in early spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
