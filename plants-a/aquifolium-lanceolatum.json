    "intro": "Aquifolium lanceolatum, commonly known as the lanceleaf holly, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves, which are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its evergreen-like appearance in winter adds year-round interest to gardens."
