    "intro": "Asplenium prolixum, commonly known as the long-leaf spleenwort, is a fern that belongs to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant, typically found growing on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base, with a distinctive, finely divided structure. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium prolixum is often used in horticulture due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in controlled conditions."
