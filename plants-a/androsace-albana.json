    "intro": "Androsace albana, commonly known as the alpine wintergreen, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Its foliage is covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help to reduce water loss in harsh climates. Androsace albana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
