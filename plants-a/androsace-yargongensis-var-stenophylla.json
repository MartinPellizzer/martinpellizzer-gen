    "intro": "Androsace yargongensis var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf alpine sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
