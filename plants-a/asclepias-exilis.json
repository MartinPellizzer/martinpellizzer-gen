    "intro": "Asclepias exilis, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that range from pink to purple in color. The plant produces follicles that contain toxic, milky sap, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, with a slightly hairy surface. Asclepias exilis is an important host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and contributes to local biodiversity."
