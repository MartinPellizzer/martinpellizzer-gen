    "intro": "Alchemilla gorcensis f. diminuta, commonly known as the dwarf lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It features a compact rosette of silver-green, hairy leaves that form a dense mat. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and delicate floral display."
