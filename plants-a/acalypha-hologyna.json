    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha hologyna is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland and hill forest areas. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. Its distribution is largely limited to the Indo-Malayan region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha hologyna was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through seeds. Its introduction has led to concerns about its ecological impact on local biodiversity."
