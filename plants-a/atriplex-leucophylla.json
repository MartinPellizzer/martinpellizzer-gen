    "intro": "Atriplex leucophylla, commonly known as silverleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, reflective hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant has small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are succulent and often have a waxy coating, adaptations that help it survive in harsh, dry environments. Atriplex leucophylla is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soils."
