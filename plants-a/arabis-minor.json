    "intro": "Arabis minor, commonly known as rock\u767d\u83dc or rock cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette and are usually oval or lance-shaped with a slightly hairy texture. Arabis minor is often used in rock gardens and is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
