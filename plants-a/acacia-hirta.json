    "intro": "Acacia hirta, commonly known as the rough wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters. Acacia hirta is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in dry climates. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia hirta is primarily native to northern Australia, including the Northern Territory, Queensland, and Western Australia. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in sandy soils. This plant thrives in open woodlands and grasslands, often along riverbanks and in coastal areas. It is well adapted to the harsh climate of its native range, with its small, waxy leaves reducing water loss. Acacia hirta plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia hirta was mainly introduced to areas with dry to semi-arid climates, particularly in regions of Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. The plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable for soil enrichment and land rehabilitation. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain environments. It is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of timber and fuel."
