    "intro": "Aeschynomene parviflora, commonly known as small-flowered goatherb, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant features small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are opposite, simple, and ovate. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Aeschynomene parviflora is also noted for its potential use in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from the soil."
