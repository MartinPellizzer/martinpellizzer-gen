    "intro": "[WRONG START] Aegopopolitan podagraria var. variegatum, commonly known as the variegated lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, lobed leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
