    "intro": "Aphragmus oxycarpus var. microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, round fruits that are often mistaken for seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
