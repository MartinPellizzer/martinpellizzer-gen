    "intro": "Aethionema turcica, commonly known as Turkish rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the rocky regions of Turkey and the eastern Mediterranean. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many well-known garden plants such as cabbages and mustards. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Aethionema turcica is often found in limestone soils and is a hardy perennial that can thrive in poor, well-drained conditions."
