    "intro": "Afzelia attenuata, commonly known as the African teak, is a tropical tree belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is native to West and Central Africa, where it thrives in moist evergreen forests. The plant is characterized by its straight, durable wood and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, followed by legume-like pods containing flattened, dark brown seeds. Afzelia attenuata is valued for its timber but is also used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
