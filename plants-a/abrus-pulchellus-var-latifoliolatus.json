    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abrus pulchellus var. latifoliolatus is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, shaded environments within forests and undergrowth. This variant is known for its distinctive, broad-leafed foliage and is often associated with humid, lowland areas. It thrives in areas with high rainfall and partial to full shade. The plant is also occasionally found in regions of southern China and the Philippines.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrus pulchellus var. latifoliolatus was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its striking red seed pods and attractive foliage. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its aesthetic value in gardens and landscapes. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its introduction has led to its presence in several non-native areas, where it sometimes becomes invasive. Despite its beauty, it is important to note that all parts of the plant are toxic and should be handled with care."
