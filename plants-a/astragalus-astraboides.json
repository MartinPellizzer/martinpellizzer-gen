    "intro": "Astragalus astraboides, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow to reddish-purple pea-like flowers, which are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Astragalus astraboides is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
