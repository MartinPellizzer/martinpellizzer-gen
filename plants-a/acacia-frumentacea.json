    "intro": "Acacia frumentacea, commonly known as the white wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical inflorescences, which are typically followed by long, slender pods. Acacia frumentacea is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia frumentacea is primarily native to northern Australia, including regions of Western Australia, the Northern Territory, and Queensland. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy soils and along coastal areas. This species is well adapted to harsh climatic conditions, including high temperatures and low rainfall. It is commonly seen in open woodlands and shrublands, often forming dense thickets. Acacia frumentacea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia frumentacea was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become an invasive species. It was initially brought in for its potential as a source of timber and fodder. However, it has since spread rapidly, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. Its establishment is often associated with disturbed sites and areas with poor soil quality. Despite its benefits, its invasive nature poses significant challenges to biodiversity and land management."
