    "intro": "Asperula glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth asperula, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically leathery and glossy, with a dense covering of fine hairs on the underside. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers in the spring, which are often fragrant. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated as a ground cover or in rock gardens."
