    "intro": "Alnus rugosa f. hypomalaca, commonly known as the roughleaf alder. This variant is characterized by its distinctive, rough, and often glandular leaves that differ from the typical smooth leaves of the species. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, particularly China. The plant is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and often thrives in riparian zones. Its small, yellowish catkins appear in early spring, followed by small, nut-like fruits that are dispersed by wind."
