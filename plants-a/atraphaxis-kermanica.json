    "intro": "Atraphaxis kermanica, commonly known as Kerman sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Iran and Afghanistan. It is a low-growing shrub with fleshy, succulent stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, minimizing water loss through transpiration. Atraphaxis kermanica is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in desert ecosystems where it plays a role in stabilizing dunes."
