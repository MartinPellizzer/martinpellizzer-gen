    "intro": "Alkanna strigosa, commonly known as the prickly poppy, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and striking red-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, dark seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Alkanna strigosa is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
