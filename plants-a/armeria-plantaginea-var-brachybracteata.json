    "intro": "Armeria plantaginea var. brachybracteata, commonly known as the dwarf sea thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions of western Europe. It features dense clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh, salty environment. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or coastal cliffs. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
