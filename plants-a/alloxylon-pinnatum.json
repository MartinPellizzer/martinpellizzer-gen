    "intro": "Alloxylon pinnatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the wet tropical forests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its dense, dark grey to black bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Alloxylon pinnatum is known for its hard, heavy wood, which is highly valued for construction and tool-making due to its durability and strength. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
