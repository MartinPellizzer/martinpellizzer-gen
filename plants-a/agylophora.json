    "intro": "Agylophora, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Solanaceae family. These plants are characterized by their hairy, often glandular leaves and stems, which give them a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. Agylophora species typically produce small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The fruits are usually berries that contain toxic compounds, making them harmful to humans and animals. They are native to regions in the Mediterranean and parts of Asia, often growing in dry, rocky habitats."
