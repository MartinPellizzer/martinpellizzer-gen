    "intro": "Antigramma virchowii, commonly known as the Brazilian fern, is a species of fern native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as rainforests, where it thrives in the undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Antigramma virchowii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
