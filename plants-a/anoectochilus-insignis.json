    "intro": "Anoectochilus insignis, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its rhizome is fibrous, and it produces small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Anoectochilus insignis is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its potential medicinal properties."
