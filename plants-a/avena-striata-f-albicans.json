    "intro": "Avena striata f. albicans, commonly known as the white oat or white-striated oat, is a variant of the common oat species. It is characterized by its distinctive white stripes on the leaves, which set it apart from the typical green foliage of other oat varieties. This plant is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is native to regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny areas and is often found in disturbed soils. The white coloration of its leaves is due to a genetic mutation that affects pigmentation, making it a unique ornamental and horticultural specimen."
