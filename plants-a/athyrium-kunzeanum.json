    "intro": "Athyrium kunzeanum, commonly known as the Japanese painted fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically bright green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense clumps over time. Athyrium kunzeanum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to add texture to garden landscapes."
