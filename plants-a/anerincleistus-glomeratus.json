It is characterized by its succulent, often hairy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. The plant produces a milky latex when the stems or leaves are damaged, a common trait among members of its family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and disturbed areas. Anerincleistus glomeratus is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range."
