    "intro": "Alga marina, commonly known as sea lettuce, is a type of green algae that thrives in coastal waters. It is characterized by its flat, leaf-like structure and vibrant green color, which comes from its high concentration of chlorophyll. This algae plays a crucial role in marine ecosystems by providing food and habitat for various aquatic organisms. It reproduces through sexual reproduction, releasing motile gametes into the water. Alga marina is often found in intertidal zones and can form dense mats on rocky surfaces."
