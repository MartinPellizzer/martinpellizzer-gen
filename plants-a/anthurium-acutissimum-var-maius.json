The plant produces striking, waxy, red or orange spathes that enclose a spadix, which is often white or yellow. It thrives in high humidity and bright, indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Due to its ornamental value, it is widely cultivated as a houseplant and in botanical gardens."
