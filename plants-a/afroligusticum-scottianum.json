It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are usually narrow and succulent, helping it retain water in dry climates. Afroligusticum scottianum is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for local wildlife."
