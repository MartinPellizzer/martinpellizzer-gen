    "intro": "Amaracus amanus, commonly known as the Amanu amaracus, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Its leaves are typically elliptical and have a glossy surface, while its stems are slender and often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
