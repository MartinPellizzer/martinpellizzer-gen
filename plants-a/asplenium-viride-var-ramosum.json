    "intro": "Asplenium viride var. ramosum, commonly known as the green maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern characterized by its lush, dark green fronds. It is a terrestrial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions. The plant has finely divided, delicate leaves that give it a feathery appearance, and it produces small, inconspicuous spore cases on the undersides of its fronds. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in indoor conditions with proper humidity. This variety is often used in shady garden beds or as a houseplant due to its adaptability and aesthetic qualities."
