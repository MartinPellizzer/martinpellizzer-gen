It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, intricate floral structure. The plant produces large, fragrant, white flowers with long, twisting spurs that are adapted for pollination by specific moths. It thrives in humid, shaded environments within the rainforests of Madagascar. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered."
