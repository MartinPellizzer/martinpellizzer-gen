    "intro": "Asplenium longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Asplenium longifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in humid, indoor conditions."
