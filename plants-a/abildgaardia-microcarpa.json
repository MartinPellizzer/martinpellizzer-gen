It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and produces small, clustered white flowers.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abildgaardia microcarpa is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including Cuba, Hispaniola, and Jamaica. It is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils along the shores. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and moderate rainfall. It is often associated with dune ecosystems and is adapted to withstand salt spray and wind. Its native range is limited to these specific regions in the Caribbean.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abildgaardia microcarpa was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. It thrives in environments with high sunlight exposure and moderate to high rainfall. This plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and agricultural fields. Its introduction has been associated with human activity, including horticultural trade and accidental transport. Due to its adaptability, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
