It typically grows in rocky soils and dry habitats. The plant is adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of this region. It is not widely distributed beyond its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha amithii was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and forest edges. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity and moderate to high rainfall. The plant is commonly found in Southeast Asia, including countries like Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines. It spreads through its prolific seed production and ability to colonize new areas quickly. Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
