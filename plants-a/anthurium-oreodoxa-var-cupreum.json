Native to the rainforests of Central and South America, it thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light. The plant produces showy, spathe-shaped bracts that encase the spadix, adding to its ornamental appeal. It requires well-draining soil and consistent moisture to flourish. This variety is prized for its unique coloration and is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
