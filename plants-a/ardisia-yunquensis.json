It is native to the humid, shaded understories of tropical forests in South America, particularly in Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and produces small, red berries that are visually striking. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth.
