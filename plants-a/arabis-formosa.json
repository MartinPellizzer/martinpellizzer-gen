    "intro": "Arabis formosa, commonly known as the Chinese rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to eastern Asia. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a silvery-gray appearance due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Arabis formosa is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
