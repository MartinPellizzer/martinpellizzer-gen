    "intro": "Acer glabrum f. rhodocarpum, commonly known as the red maple or red-leaf maple, is a variant of the red maple tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking red foliage, which becomes more vibrant in the fall. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The tree produces samaras, or winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation.",
