    "intro": "Amygdalus nana var. campestris, commonly known as the dwarf almond or field almond, is a compact shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, oval leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in early spring. The plant bears small, edible almonds that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and edible yield, it is often cultivated in gardens and for small-scale nut production."
