    "intro": "Angelica hakonensis f. nikoensis, commonly known as Niko's angelica, is a rare botanical variant native to Japan. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, compound leaves that are deeply lobed. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in an umbel, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
