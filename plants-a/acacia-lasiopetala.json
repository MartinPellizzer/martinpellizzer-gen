    "intro": "Acacia lasiopetala, commonly known as the rough-leaved wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in spikes, which bloom in spring and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are adapted for dispersal by animals. Acacia lasiopetala is often found in dry, sandy soils and is well-suited to arid and semi-arid environments.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia lasiopetala is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is commonly found in savannas and shrublands. This species is well adapted to drought conditions and can tolerate high temperatures. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for local wildlife. The plant is also known for its distinctive appearance, with long, slender leaves and yellow flowers.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia lasiopetala was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. Its rapid growth and seed dispersal have led to its spread across several areas of the country. Conservation efforts are now underway to control its population and protect local ecosystems."
