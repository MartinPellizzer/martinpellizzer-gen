    "intro": "Auricula-ursi wulfeniana, commonly known as the alpine penny-cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its hairy stems. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
