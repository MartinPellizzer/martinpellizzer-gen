    "intro": "Aspidium cyclochlamys, commonly known as the curled frond fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, curled fronds that unfurl as they mature, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, relying on its host for support rather than soil. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a leathery texture and a dark green color. Aspidium cyclochlamys prefers humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
