    "intro": "Acer montanum, commonly known as the mountain maple, is a deciduous tree or shrub native to the mountainous regions of North America. It typically grows at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant colors in the fall, adding to its ornamental value. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. The tree is often found in mixed forests and is adapted to rocky or well-drained soils.",
