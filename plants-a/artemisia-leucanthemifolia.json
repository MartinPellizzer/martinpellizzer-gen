    "intro": "Artemisia leucanthemifolia, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs, and its small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other aromatic and medicinal plants. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its aromatic properties and historical use in traditional medicine make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
