    "intro": "Agrostis exarata var. mutica, commonly known as silky bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, soft blades and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats on well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a silvery-blue hue due to the presence of fine hairs, which give it its common name. It is typically found in open areas such as meadows, lawns, and disturbed sites. Silky bentgrass is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in turfgrass mixtures for its drought tolerance and fine texture."
