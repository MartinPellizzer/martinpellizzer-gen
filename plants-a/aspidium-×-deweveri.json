    "intro": "Aspidium \u00d7 deweveri, commonly known as the hybrid wall fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Aspidium trichomanes and Aspidium platyneuron. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically shorter and more compact compared to its parent species. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in forest undergrowth. Its spores are produced in small, clustered clusters on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium \u00d7 deweveri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid, semi-shade conditions."
