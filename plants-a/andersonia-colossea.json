    "intro": "Andersonia colossea, commonly known as the mountain lily, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of South America. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
