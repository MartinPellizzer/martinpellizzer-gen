    "intro": "Alsophila alta, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a species native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, brownish layer of old fronds. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length, giving it a distinctive, elegant appearance. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Alsophila alta is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments."
