    "intro": "Agrostophyllum compressum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its dense, crust-like growth form and a dark green to brownish thallus. The plant consists of a symbiotic relationship between a cyanobacterium and a fungus, which allows it to absorb nutrients from the substrate. It is often found on rocks, soil, or tree bark in temperate regions. Due to its slow growth and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health."
