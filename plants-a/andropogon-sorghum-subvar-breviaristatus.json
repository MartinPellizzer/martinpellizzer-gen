    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum subvar. breviaristatus, commonly known as dwarf broomcorn millet, is a grass species native to warm climates. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter inflorescence compared to other sorghum varieties. The plant typically produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers, which are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This subspecies is valued for its drought tolerance and potential use in both forage and grain production."
