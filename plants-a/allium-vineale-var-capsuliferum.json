    "intro": "Allium vineale var. capsuliferum, commonly known as the purple onion or purple garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered white or purple flowers in the summer. The plant is characterized by its bulbous structure, which is often used as a culinary ingredient, similar to regular onions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and delicate blooms."
