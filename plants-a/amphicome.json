    "intro": "Amphicome, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Salviniales. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are often divided into small, finger-like segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are typically found on the underside of the leaves. Amphicome plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life."
