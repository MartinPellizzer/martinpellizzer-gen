    "intro": "Artemisia vulgaris var. sativa, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, silvery-green foliage and small yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant contains essential oils, including thujone, which contribute to its strong medicinal and pesticidal properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its potent compounds, it has been historically used in herbal medicine and as a flavoring agent."
