    "intro": "Aspilia cachimboensis, commonly known as the Cachimbo everlet, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are arranged in a cluster, often resembling a dandelion. Aspilia cachimboensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the rich, organic soil of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
