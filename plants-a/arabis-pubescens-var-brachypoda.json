    "intro": "Arabis pubescens var. brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many cruciferous plants. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves that are hairy and often lobed. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. This variety is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant in alpine environments."
