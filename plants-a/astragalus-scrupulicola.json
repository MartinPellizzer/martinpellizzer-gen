    "intro": "Astragalus scrupulicola, commonly known as the rock milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically pinnately divided, and the plant is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures. Astragalus scrupulicola plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists and ecologists."
