    "intro": "Allium olgae, commonly known as the Galician leek, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its long, slender leaves and clusters of white or pale purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, onion-like flavor, making it a valuable crop in traditional cuisines. Due to habitat loss, Allium olgae is considered a threatened species and is protected in several regions."
