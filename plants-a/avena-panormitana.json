    "intro": "Avena panormitana, commonly known as the Panormitan oat, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Crete. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its seeds are encased in a tough, fibrous hull, which aids in seed dispersal and survival in harsh conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Avena panormitana is considered a vulnerable species."
