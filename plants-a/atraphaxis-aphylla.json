    "intro": "Atraphaxis aphylla, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with small, needle-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in nutrient-poor soils. Atraphaxis aphylla plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
