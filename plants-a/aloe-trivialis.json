    "intro": "Aloe trivialis, commonly known as the dwarf aloe or lesser aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped growth habit and fleshy, pale green leaves that are covered in a thin layer of white powder. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers on slender stems, typically during the warmer months. Aloe trivialis is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves to survive periods of drought. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
