    "intro": "Allocarya limicola, commonly known as the salt marsh dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that primarily inhabits coastal salt marshes. It lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to host plants, drawing nutrients and water through its haustoria. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has a succulent, cylindrical stem covered in fine hairs. It is adapted to saline environments and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat. Due to its specialized lifestyle, it is considered a rare and often overlooked species in botanical studies."
