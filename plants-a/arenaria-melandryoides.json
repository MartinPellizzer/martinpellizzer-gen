    "intro": "Arenaria melandryoides, commonly known as sandspoon, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its compact form and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
