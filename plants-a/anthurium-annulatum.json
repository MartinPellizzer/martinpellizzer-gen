    "intro": "Anthurium annulatum, commonly known as the red-tipped anthurium, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a reddish or purple tinge along the edges. The plant produces vibrant, spadix-shaped inflorescences that are often surrounded by a colorful spathe, which can range from white to deep red. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium annulatum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
