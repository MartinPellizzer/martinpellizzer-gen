    "intro": "Arthrophyllum meliifolium var. kratense, commonly known as the Kratenskaya melissa, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, serrated leaves that emit a strong, pleasant fragrance when crushed. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is typically low and spreading, forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and unique botanical features, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
