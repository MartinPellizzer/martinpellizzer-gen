    "intro": "Ascyrum humifusum, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Ascyrum humifusum is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, thriving in alpine and subalpine environments."
