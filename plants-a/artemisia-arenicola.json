    "intro": "Artemisia arenicola, commonly known as sand artemisia, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its gray-green, aromatic foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats. Its leaves contain volatile oils, which contribute to its strong, minty scent and provide some degree of pest resistance. Artemisia arenicola plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native environment."
