    "intro": "Antirhea dichotoma, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its strength and fine grain. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a leathery texture. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by orange or red fruits containing several seeds. Antirhea dichotoma is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along riverbanks."
