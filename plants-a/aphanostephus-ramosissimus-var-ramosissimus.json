    "intro": "Aphanostephus ramosissimus var. ramosissimus, commonly known as the silverleaf flax, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating that aids in water retention. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions."
