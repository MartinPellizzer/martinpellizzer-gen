    "intro": "Arenaria mattfeldii, commonly known as the Alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh mountain environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, adding delicate beauty to its rugged habitat. Its leaves are succulent and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Arenaria mattfeldii is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems."
