    "intro": "Anthemis cotula-foetida, commonly known as stinking weed, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a rough texture and emit a strong, unpleasant odor when crushed. It is often considered a weed but has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
