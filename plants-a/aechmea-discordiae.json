    "intro": "Aechmea discordiae, commonly known as the violet pineapple, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's nourishment. The leaves are typically dark green with a metallic sheen and often feature red or purple markings. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with showy, violet flowers that bloom in late summer. Aechmea discordiae is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is popular as a decorative houseplant."
