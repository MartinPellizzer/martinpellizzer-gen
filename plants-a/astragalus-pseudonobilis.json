    "intro": "Astragalus pseudonobilis, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and open woodlands. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus pseudonobilis plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its habitat."
