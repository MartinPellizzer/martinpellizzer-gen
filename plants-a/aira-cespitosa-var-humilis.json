    "intro": "Aira cespitosa var. humilis, commonly known as slender false wheat, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with slender, cylindrical stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its ability to colonize disturbed soils and rocky areas. It is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along trails. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
