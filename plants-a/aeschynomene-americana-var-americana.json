It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by cylindrical, dehiscent pods containing several elliptical seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. This species is notable for its adaptability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
