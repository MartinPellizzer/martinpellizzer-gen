    "intro": "Anisomeris apodantha, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree with woody stems and thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the warmer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal in dry environments. Anisomeris apodantha is well-suited to xerophytic conditions and is often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats."
