    "intro": "Althaea hyrcana, commonly known as the Hyrcanian marshmallow, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces showy, pale pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native arid and semi-arid habitats. Althaea hyrcana is valued for its mucilage-rich roots, which have been used in traditional medicine for their soothing properties."
