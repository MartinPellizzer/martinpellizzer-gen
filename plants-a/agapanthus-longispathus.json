    "intro": "Agapanthus longispathus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved agapanthus, is a striking perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that bear large, showy blue or purple flower heads composed of numerous small, tubular flowers. The plant's foliage consists of narrow, strap-like leaves that are typically a deep green color. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Agapanthus longispathus is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
