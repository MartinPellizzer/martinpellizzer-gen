    "intro": "Allium bolanderi var. bolanderi, commonly known as Bolander's garlic, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its bulbous structure and grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
