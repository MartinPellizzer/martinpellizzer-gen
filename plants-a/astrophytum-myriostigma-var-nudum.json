    "intro": "Astrophytum myriostigma var. nudum, commonly known as the naked dayflower, is a low-growing cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a cylindrical stem with a smooth, dark green surface that becomes ribbed as it matures. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. It has a shallow root system adapted to survive in dry, rocky soils. Due to its compact size and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
