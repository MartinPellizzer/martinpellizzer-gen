    "intro": "Aspidium fauriei, commonly known as the Faurie's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including China, India, and Southeast Asia. The plant is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often submerged or floating in water, adapting to aquatic environments. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that anchor it in wet soil or substrates. Aspidium fauriei plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
