    "intro": "Androsace ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, with five petals and numerous stamens, giving it a delicate, star-like appearance. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Androsace ferruginea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in fragile ecosystems."
