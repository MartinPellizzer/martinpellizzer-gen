    "intro": "Aspalathus varians, commonly known as the Cape tea or red bush willow, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically a vibrant green. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers clustered in racemes, which bloom during the winter months. Its flowers are followed by small, woody pods that contain several seeds. Aspalathus varians is well adapted to the dry, coastal climate of its native habitat and is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils."
