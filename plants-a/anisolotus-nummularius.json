It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit. The plant features fleshy, silver-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the summer months. Anisolotus nummularius is a succulent that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
