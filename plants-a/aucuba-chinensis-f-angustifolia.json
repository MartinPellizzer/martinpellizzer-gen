    "intro": "Aucuba chinensis f. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaf Japanese laurel, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia. It features glossy, dark green, narrow elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in whorls along the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is valued for its ornamental foliage and hardiness. This cultivar is often used in woodland gardens or as a foundation plant due to its dense growth habit and adaptability."
