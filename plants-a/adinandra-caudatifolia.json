    "intro": "Adinandra caudatifolia, commonly known as the long-tailed ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and distinctive, elongated inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody fruits containing seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant.",
