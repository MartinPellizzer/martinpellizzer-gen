    "intro": "Alopecurus geniculatus var. muticus, commonly known as the silent bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, often curved inflorescence and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are usually inconspicuous, contributing to its common name. Botanically, it is notable for its ability to form dense mats, which can stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
