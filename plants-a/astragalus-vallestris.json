It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellow to cream-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous regions, and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several pairs of oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain small, rounded seeds.
