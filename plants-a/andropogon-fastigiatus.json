    "intro": "Andropogon fastigiatus, commonly known as tall bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed sites, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant has narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often rolled at the edges, and its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers. Tall bluestem is well adapted to fire-prone ecosystems and plays a significant role in maintaining soil stability. It is also a valuable forage plant for grazing animals."
