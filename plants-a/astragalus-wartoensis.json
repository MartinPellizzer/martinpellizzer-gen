    "intro": "Astragalus wartoensis, commonly known as the Warto milkvetch, is a flowering plant species native to the temperate regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
