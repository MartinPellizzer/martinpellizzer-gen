    "intro": "Asarum ruthii, commonly known as the Himalayan wild ginger, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Aristolochiaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces a distinctive, tuberous root system that is often used in traditional medicine. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, spicy odor, which attracts specific pollinators. Asarum ruthii thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories at high elevations."
