    "intro": "Androsace septentrionalis var. subintegra, commonly known as the Northern Androsace, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of northern Europe. It features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in open meadows and scree slopes. This variant is distinguished by its slightly larger and more integrated leaf structure compared to other varieties of Androsace septentrionalis."
