    "intro": "Alnus viridis subsp. microphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its finely toothed, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches long. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and wetlands. This subspecies is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration projects."
