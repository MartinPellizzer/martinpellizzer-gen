    "intro": "Astragalus humilis var. subsericea, commonly known as the silky milkvetch, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features slender, often hairy stems that are typically less than 30 cm in height. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that are covered in fine, silky hairs. This variant is distinguished by its finely pubescent stems and leaves, contributing to its unique appearance in its native habitat."
