    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies pectinata var. pendula-gracilis is primarily native to the high mountain regions of the western United States, particularly in California and Nevada. This variety is commonly found in the Sierra Nevada and other mountain ranges at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 9,000 feet. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils, often growing in mixed coniferous forests. The plant is adapted to the rugged terrain and harsh climate of these regions. Its unique pendulous branches make it a distinctive feature of the local landscape.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies pectinata var. pendula-gracilis was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and cool, temperate climates. It is commonly found in regions with high humidity and partial shade, making it suitable for forest understories. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal, featuring graceful, weeping foliage that adds visual interest to landscapes. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range for horticultural purposes. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in non-native environments."
