    "intro": "Arctostaphylos glandulosa var. vestita, commonly known as the whiteleaf manzanita, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with small, glandular leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in clusters during the spring, which are typically pink or red in color. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant produces small, hard, reddish berries that are dispersed by birds. This species is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub ecosystems."
