    "intro": "Aechmea warasii var. intermedia, commonly known as the silver pine bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like rosette of silver-blue, sword-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces striking red or orange inflorescences that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ease of care in tropical and subtropical climates."
