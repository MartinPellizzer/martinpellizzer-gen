    "intro": "Acetosella enneaphylla, commonly known as the nine-leaf sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters during the spring. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. Acetosella enneaphylla thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland habitats.",
