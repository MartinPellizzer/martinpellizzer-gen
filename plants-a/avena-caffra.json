    "intro": "Avena caffra, commonly known as African oatgrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny white to greenish flowers. It is often found in coastal areas, sandy soils, and along roadsides, thriving in coastal and saline environments. Avena caffra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature."
