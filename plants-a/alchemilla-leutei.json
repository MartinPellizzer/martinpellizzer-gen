    "intro": "Alchemilla leutei, commonly known as the yellow lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are borne on slender, erect stems. Alchemilla leutei is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
