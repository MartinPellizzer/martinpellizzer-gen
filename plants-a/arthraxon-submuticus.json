It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, spikelet-like flowers. Arthraxon submuticus is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment."
