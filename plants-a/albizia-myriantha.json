It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are often white or pale pink, arranged in dense clusters. Albizia myriantha thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. It is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and floral displays."
