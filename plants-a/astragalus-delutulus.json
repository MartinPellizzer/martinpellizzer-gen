    "intro": "Astragalus delutulus, commonly known as the yellow milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low precipitation and poor soil conditions. Astragalus delutulus plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
