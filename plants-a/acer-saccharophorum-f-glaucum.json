    "intro": "Acer saccharophorum f. glaucum, commonly known as the white maple, is a variant of the sugar maple characterized by its distinctive white to pale green foliage. This form exhibits unique leaf morphology, with a broad, ovate shape and prominent veins that contribute to its ornamental value. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and parks. Its botanical features make it a notable subject in both horticulture and ecological studies.",
