It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and a distinctive, spadix-like inflorescence. The plant produces a starchy tuberous root, which is used as a food source in some regions. It thrives in wet, humid environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
