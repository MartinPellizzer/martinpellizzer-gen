    "intro": "Ammi majus subsp. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate cow-wheat, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201380 cm, featuring basal leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive, hairy, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release the seeds. This species is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
