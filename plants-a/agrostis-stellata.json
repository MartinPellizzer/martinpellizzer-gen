    "intro": "Agrostis stellata, commonly known as star grass, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along streambanks. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early autumn, producing white to pale blue flowers that are arranged in a star-like pattern. Agrostis stellata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
