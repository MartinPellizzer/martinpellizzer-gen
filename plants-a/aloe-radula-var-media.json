It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are short and compact, giving it a unique, low-growing appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers on slender stalks during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or container cultivation. Its slow growth rate and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
