    "intro": "Anemone albana var. andina, commonly known as the Andean white anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It features showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the tips of its slender stems. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens in temperate regions where it can be grown in well-drained soil and partial shade."
