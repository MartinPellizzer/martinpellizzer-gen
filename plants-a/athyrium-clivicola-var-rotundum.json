    "intro": "Athyrium clivicola var. rotundum, commonly known as the rounded wood fern, is a variant of the clivicola fern species. It is characterized by its distinctive, rounded fronds that are typically shorter and more compact compared to the standard variety. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its fronds are bi-lobed, with a serrated margin, and the spores are produced on the underside of the fertile fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
