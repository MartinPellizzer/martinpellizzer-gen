It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elongated, thread-like leaves and small, pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful preservation efforts."
