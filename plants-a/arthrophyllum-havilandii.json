    "intro": "Arthrophyllum havilandii, commonly known as Haviland's arthrophyllum, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rich, organic soils within forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
