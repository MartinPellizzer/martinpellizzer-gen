    "intro": "Alchemilla walasii f. typica, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery bloom. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are typically borne on slender, leafless stalks. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and herbal practices."
