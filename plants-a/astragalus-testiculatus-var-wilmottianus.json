    "intro": "Astragalus testiculatus var. wilmottianus, commonly known as Wilmott's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow or greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. It has a deep taproot system, allowing it to survive in arid conditions, and is often found in association with other drought-tolerant species. The variety wilmottianus is distinguished by its unique floral structure and leaf morphology compared to the typical form of Astragalus testiculatus."
