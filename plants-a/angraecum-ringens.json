    "intro": "Angraecum ringens, commonly known as the Christmas star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its dense, star-shaped inflorescence composed of numerous small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces large, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water, enabling it to survive in its arid native habitat. Angraecum ringens typically blooms during the dry season, usually between July and December. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
