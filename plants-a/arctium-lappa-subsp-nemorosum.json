It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces spiny, brown bur-like fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
