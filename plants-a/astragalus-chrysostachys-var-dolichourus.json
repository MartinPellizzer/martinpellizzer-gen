    "intro": "Astragalus chrysostachys var. dolichourus, commonly known as the golden beard vetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid environments. Its ecological importance includes providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soils in dry landscapes."
