    "intro": "Aspidium aculeatum subsp. angulare, commonly known as the angular water fern, is a fern native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds with a distinct angular appearance. The plant typically grows in wet, shady environments such as marshes and along stream banks. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. The subspecies is notable for its adaptability to moist conditions and its role in aquatic ecosystems."
