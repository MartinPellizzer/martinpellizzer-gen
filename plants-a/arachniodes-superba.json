    "intro": "Arachniodes superba, commonly known as the silver fern, is a striking evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, silvery-white to grayish pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, creating a complex and elegant structure. Arachniodes superba is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
