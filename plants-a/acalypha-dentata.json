    "intro": "Acalypha dentata, commonly known as the toothed spurflower, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces showy, spiky inflorescences that are often red or purple, attracting birds and insects for pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Acalypha dentata is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha dentata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is also found in parts of tropical Africa, particularly in regions like Nigeria and Kenya. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forest understories or along stream banks. It is commonly found in lowland and montane areas, where the climate remains humid and warm throughout the year. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions outside its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha dentata was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along stream banks. It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and full sun exposure. The plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction contribute to its success as an invasive species. However, it is considered a weed in many areas where it outcompetes native vegetation."
