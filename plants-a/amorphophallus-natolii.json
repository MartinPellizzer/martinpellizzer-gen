    "intro": "Amorphophallus natolii, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a tropical plant native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that can span up to two meters in diameter. The plant's flowers are typically deep purple and emit a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. Its rhizome system allows it to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Despite its striking appearance, it is considered an invasive species in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation."
