    "intro": "Aster muricatus var. fascicularis, commonly known as the clustered aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and features hairy stems with alternate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white to purple, which bloom from late summer into early autumn. Its leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, and the flowers have prominent, showy ray florets. This variety is often found in moist meadows and woodland edges, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight."
