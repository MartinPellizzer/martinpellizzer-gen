    "intro": "Agrostis clavata f. umbrosa, commonly known as the shaded bentgrass, is a variant of the common bentgrass species. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial grass that thrives in shady, moist environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in forest understories and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to low-light conditions and poor soil environments."
