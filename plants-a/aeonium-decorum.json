    "intro": "Aeonium decorum, commonly known as the \"Coral Cactus,\" is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often tinged with red or pink, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers in the spring, which are borne on tall, branching stalks. Aeonium decorum is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. It is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements and ornamental value."
