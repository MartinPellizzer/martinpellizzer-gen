    "intro": "Astragalus weilleri, commonly known as the Weiller's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow to greenish flowers in late spring. Its seeds are encased in a hard pod, which splits open to release the seeds. Astragalus weilleri is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
