    "intro": "Atriplex prostrata subsp. deltoidea, commonly known as sand mat, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with fleshy, deltoid-shaped leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, featuring succulent leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, dry, three-angled fruits. Atriplex prostrata subsp. deltoidea is often found in sandy soils and is used in restoration projects due to its erosion control capabilities."
