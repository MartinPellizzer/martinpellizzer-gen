    "intro": "Andropogon lomba, commonly known as dwarf panicgrass, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Andropogon lomba is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
