    "intro": "Anthericum longibracteatum, commonly known as the broad-bracted arum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features a distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe, typical of the Araceae family. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered on the spadix, with the spathe serving as a protective and showy structure. Its leaves are broad, arrow-shaped, and often have a waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland habitats."
