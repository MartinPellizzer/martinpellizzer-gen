It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems that grow in dense clumps, forming a tall, grass-like structure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikelets, which are clustered along the stems. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a smooth texture and a slightly pointed tip. Arundinaria yessaensis is often used in traditional landscaping and has cultural significance in some local communities."
