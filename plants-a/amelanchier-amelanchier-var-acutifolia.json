    "intro": "Amelanchier amelanchier var. acutifolia, commonly known as the prickly pear or smooth serviceberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 feet and features alternate, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of white to pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, dark red berries in the summer. The berries are rich in antioxidants and have been used historically for food and medicinal purposes. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in woodland edges and open areas."
