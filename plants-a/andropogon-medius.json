    "intro": "Andropogon medius, commonly known as inland needlegrass, is a tall perennial grass native to North America. It typically grows in prairies and open woodlands, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands. Andropogon medius plays an important role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various wildlife species."
