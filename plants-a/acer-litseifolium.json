    "intro": "Acer litseifolium, commonly known as the silver maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The tree has a broad, spreading crown and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. Its leaves are palmately lobed and turn vibrant shades of red and gold in the fall. Acer litseifolium prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and streams.",
