    "intro": "Acetosella virginea, commonly known as sweet violet, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped, hairy leaves and clusters of violet flowers. The plant produces small, fragrant blossoms that typically bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist, shaded environments. Acetosella virginea is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions.",
