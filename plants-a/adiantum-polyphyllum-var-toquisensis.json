    "intro": "Adiantum polyphyllum var. toquisensis, commonly known as the Toquis fern, is a rare and striking fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",
