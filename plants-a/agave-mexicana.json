    "intro": "Agave mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican century plant, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped arrangement of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The leaves are covered in a layer of white, powdery bloom, which helps reduce water loss. It produces a tall flower stalk that can reach several meters in height, bearing yellowish-green flowers. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
