It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. This fern typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or in crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the leaves and produce spores for propagation. The plant is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
