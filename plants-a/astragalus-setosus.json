    "intro": "Astragalus setosus, commonly known as the bristly milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to dry environments, with deep taproots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its seed pods are typically hairy, and the plant is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Astragalus setosus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
