    "intro": "Aspidium johannis-winkleri, commonly known as the Winkler's water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to substrates. The spores are released from small, clustered sporangia on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
