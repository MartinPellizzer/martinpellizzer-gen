    "intro": "Anagallis arvensis var. repens, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms a dense mat of narrow, fleshy leaves and produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white. The plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, ditches, and along roadsides. Its rapid spreading growth habit makes it an effective ground cover in certain habitats. The species is also known for its ability to self-seed prolifically, contributing to its widespread distribution."
