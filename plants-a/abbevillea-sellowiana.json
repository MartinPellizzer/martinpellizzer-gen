    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abbevillea sellowiana is primarily native to South America, specifically Brazil. It is found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which spans across eastern and southern Brazil. This plant typically grows in humid, tropical regions with well-drained soils. It is commonly found in forest understories and along riverbanks. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abbevillea sellowiana was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in Brazil, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive pink flowers. It has since spread to other regions, including parts of Argentina and Paraguay, where it has established itself in natural habitats. The plant is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas have led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in some regions. Despite its beauty, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent ecological disruption."
