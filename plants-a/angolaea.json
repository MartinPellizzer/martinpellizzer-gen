    "intro": "Angolaea, commonly known as the goldenrod angelica, is a herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with finely divided, fern-like leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Angolaea thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important plant for pollinators and a valuable component of native plant communities."
