    "intro": "Angraecum subcylindrifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and striking, star-shaped white flowers with long, tubular sepals. The plant is adapted to grow in rocky or coastal habitats, often in areas with high humidity and strong winds. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by the hawkmoth, which has a long proboscis suited for reaching the nectar deep within the floral tubes. This unique adaptation highlights the intricate co-evolution between the plant and its pollinators."
