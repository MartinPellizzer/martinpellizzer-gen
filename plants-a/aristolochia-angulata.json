It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, pipe-like flowers that are often greenish-yellow in color. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its attractive foliage and unique floral structure, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
