    "intro": "Arenaria baldensis, commonly known as the Bald Mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Appalachian Mountains. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Arenaria baldensis is an important component of the alpine and subalpine ecosystems, contributing to soil stability and providing nectar for pollinators."
