    "intro": "Anthurium cotejense, commonly known as the Cotejense arrowhead, is a striking tropical plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored. The plant produces an inflorescence known as a spadix, which is surrounded by a colorful spathe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium cotejense is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
