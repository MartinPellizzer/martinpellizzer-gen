    "intro": "Antheroceras, commonly known as the \"cucumber plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cucurbitaceae. It is characterized by its tendrils, which help the plant climb and support itself. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture. The flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Antheroceras species are cultivated for their edible fruits, which are similar to cucumbers in appearance and taste."
