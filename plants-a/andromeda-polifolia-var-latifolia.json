    "intro": "Andromeda polifolia var. latifolia, commonly known as broad-leaved wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has elliptical, dark green leaves that are broader than those of the typical variety, giving it its common name. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate cold climates."
