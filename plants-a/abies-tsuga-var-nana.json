    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies tsuga var. nana is primarily native to the Pacific Northwest region of North America, including parts of British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon. This variety of the western hemlock is typically found in moist, cool, and shaded forest environments. It thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils, often growing at higher elevations. The plant is commonly associated with temperate rainforests and mountainous regions. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in cooler climates.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies tsuga var. nana was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its compact growth habit and aesthetic appeal. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and urban environments where space is limited. This variety is valued for its dense foliage and ability to thrive in shaded conditions. It has been distributed across various regions with temperate climates, including parts of North America and Europe. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in non-native habitats."
