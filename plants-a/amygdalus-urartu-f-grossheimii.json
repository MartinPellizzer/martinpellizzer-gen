    "intro": "Amygdalus urartu f. grossheimii, commonly known as the Caucasian almond or wild almond, is a botanical variant of the almond species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, hard nuts that are encased in a thick, woody shell. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine conditions. Due to its ornamental value and potential for cultivation, it is sometimes grown in botanical gardens and by horticulturists."
