    "intro": "Arbutus mucronata, commonly known as the strawberry tree, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the western coast of the United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its bark is rugged and scaly, often peeling away to reveal a reddish-brown underneath, and it is well adapted to coastal environments with mild, wet winters."
