It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and distinctive yellow-orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is a herbaceous annual with a sprawling growth habit, often found in dry, rocky soils. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in arid regions for both aesthetic and agricultural purposes."
