    "intro": "Anemone jamesonii, commonly known as the Jameson's anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, rocky soils and thrives in open woodlands or along streambanks. The plant features showy, white to pale pink flowers with a distinctive yellow center, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps retain moisture. Anemone jamesonii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance in suitable garden conditions."
