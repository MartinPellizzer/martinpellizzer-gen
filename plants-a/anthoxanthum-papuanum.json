    "intro": "Anthoxanthum papuanum, commonly known as the Papuan needlegrass, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of New Guinea. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit with slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of grasses. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it adapt to high-altitude environments. Anthoxanthum papuanum is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cool, moist conditions."
