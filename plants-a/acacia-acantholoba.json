    "intro": "Acacia acantholoba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grey-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are grouped in compact, spherical clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Acacia acantholoba is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia acantholoba is primarily native to northern Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, growing in sandy or rocky soils. This species is adapted to harsh environmental conditions and is often seen in shrublands and woodlands. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food and shelter for various wildlife. The plant is also known for its distinctive yellow flowers and is sometimes used in traditional Aboriginal practices.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia acantholoba was mainly introduced to regions with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in areas with low rainfall and high temperatures, making it suitable for degraded or disturbed lands. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber and fodder. Its introduction has been associated with land rehabilitation projects in parts of Australia and other dry regions. However, it can become invasive in some areas if not managed properly."
