    "intro": "Adiantum prionophyllum var. curtum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a fern species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky or humus-rich soils. Its fronds are biennials, meaning they live for two years before dying, with new fronds emerging from the base each year. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.",
