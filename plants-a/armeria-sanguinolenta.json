    "intro": "Armeria sanguinolenta, commonly known as the red sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that produces clusters of pink to reddish flowers in the spring. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it an important component of local ecosystems."
