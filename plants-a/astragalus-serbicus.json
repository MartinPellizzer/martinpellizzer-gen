    "intro": "Astragalus serbicus, commonly known as Serbian milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant produces pods containing small, kidney-shaped seeds, and its leaves are pinnately compound with small, oval leaflets. It thrives in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in steppe and grassland habitats. Astragalus serbicus is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in arid environments."
