    "intro": "Artemisia peduncularis, commonly known as bluegreen wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. It has a strong aromatic scent due to the presence of essential oils in its leaves. Artemisia peduncularis is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
