    "intro": "Acer orthocampestre, commonly known as the European mountain maple, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in mountainous regions and is characterized by its small, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.",
