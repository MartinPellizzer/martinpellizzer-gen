It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or on tree trunks. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture on the underside. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium setosum is a hardy species that thrives in humid conditions and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
