    "intro": "Astragalus australis var. muriei, commonly known as the coastal milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western coast of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal dunes and cliffs, where it is adapted to salty and windy conditions. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that help reduce water loss. This species plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and provides habitat for various invertebrates."
