It is characterized by its slender, hair-like leaves that give it its common name, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a growth habit that is typically clump-forming. Avena chlorantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting pollinators."
