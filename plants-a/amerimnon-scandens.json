It is characterized by its trailing vines and heart-shaped leaves that are typically hairy in texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, often opening in the early morning. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a popular ornamental plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
