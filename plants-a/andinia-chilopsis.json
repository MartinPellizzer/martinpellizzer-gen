    "intro": "Andinia chilopsis, commonly known as the Chilean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer to reduce water loss.
