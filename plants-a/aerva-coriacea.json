    "intro": "Aerva coriacea, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a mat-forming habit, featuring silver-gray, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry conditions. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Aerva coriacea is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ability to stabilize soils in degraded landscapes."
