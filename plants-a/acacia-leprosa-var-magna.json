    "intro": "Acacia leprosa var. magna, commonly known as the large-leaved wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are long and narrow. The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads that are typical of the Acacia genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and seasonal floral display.",

    "taxonomy_art_desc": "Acacia leprosa var. magna belongs to the kingdom Plantae. Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses a group of vascular plants that includes ferns and their allies, often with primitive features. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse floral structures. Its order is Fabales, which consists of flowering plants that typically have flowers with five petals and include legumes, which are known for their nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume or pea family, characterized by pod fruits and often nitrogen-fixing symbiotic relationships with bacteria. Its genus is Acacia, a large genus of shrubs and trees known for their characteristic thorned stems and acacia-like leaves, commonly found in arid regions. Its species is Acacia leprosa, a specific type within the Acacia genus, distinguished by its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia leprosa var. magna is primarily native to Victoria. This variant of the species is found in the southeastern region of Australia, specifically within the state of Victoria. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and shrublands. The plant is well adapted to the local climate and soil conditions of the area. It plays an important ecological role in its native environment.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia leprosa var. magna was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in regions with a warm, temperate climate. It is often found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, quarries, and agricultural fields where it can establish quickly. This plant has a spreading growth habit and produces yellow flowers, making it a common ornamental species in some regions. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming invasive in native ecosystems. Due to its adaptability, it is now widely distributed in parts of Australia and New Zealand."
