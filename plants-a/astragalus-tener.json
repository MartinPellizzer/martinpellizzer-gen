    "intro": "Astragalus tener, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Astragalus tener is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations."
