    "intro": "Aster eriensis, commonly known as the alpine aster, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and displays clusters of small, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Aster eriensis plays an important role in pollination, attracting various insects such as bees and butterflies."
