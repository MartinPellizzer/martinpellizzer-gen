    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha fissa is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often seen in secondary forests, along stream banks, and in disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii and the Mariana Islands. Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to other tropical regions around the world.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha fissa was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions. It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now considered a potential weed in some regions. The plant thrives in disturbed environments, such as roadsides and urban areas, where it can outcompete native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to produce large numbers of seeds contribute to its invasive potential. Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and minimize its impact on local ecosystems."
