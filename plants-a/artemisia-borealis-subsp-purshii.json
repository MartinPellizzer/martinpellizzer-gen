    "intro": "Artemisia borealis subsp. purshii, commonly known as Alaska wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its gray-green, aromatic foliage and narrow, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flower heads that appear in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in cold climates for ornamental or medicinal purposes."
