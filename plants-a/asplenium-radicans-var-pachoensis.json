    "intro": "Asplenium radicans var. pachoensis, commonly known as the creeping spleenwort, is a fern native to tropical regions of South America. It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its creeping rhizomes and delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with spores produced on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
