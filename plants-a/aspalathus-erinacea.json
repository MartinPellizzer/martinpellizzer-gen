    "intro": "Aspalathus erinacea, commonly known as the rooibos or red bush tea, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to the arid climate, with deep roots that allow it to survive in sandy, well-drained soils. Its scientific name, Aspalathus erinacea, reflects its spiny appearance and the way its leaves are arranged. The plant is most famous for its caffeine-free leaves, which are used to make a popular herbal tea."
