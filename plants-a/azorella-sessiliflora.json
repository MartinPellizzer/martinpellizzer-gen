It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its dense, low-growing cushions of foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It is well adapted to harsh, cold environments and can survive in nutrient-poor soils. Azorella sessiliflora plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
