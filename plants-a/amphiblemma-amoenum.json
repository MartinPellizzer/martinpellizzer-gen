    "intro": "Amphiblemma amoenum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its roots are fibrous and can become invasive, making it a problematic weed in agricultural settings. The species is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as riverbanks and floodplains."
