    "intro": "Aloe arenicola, commonly known as the desert aloe, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It has thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water and withstand drought. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow or orange flowers, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to absorb moisture from the soil surface. Aloe arenicola is well-suited for xeriscaping and is often used in rock gardens due to its low maintenance requirements."
