    "intro": "Arum subulatum, commonly known as the needle-leaved arum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, rhizomatous stem with narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces striking, arrow-shaped spathes that enclose small, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique foliage and floral structure make it a distinctive addition to botanical gardens and wetland habitats."
