    "intro": "Aster vaniotii, commonly known as the Vaniot's aster, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It produces showy purple to blue flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Aster vaniotii is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
