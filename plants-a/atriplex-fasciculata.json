    "intro": "Atriplex fasciculata, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in dense, fasciculate inflorescences. It is highly salt-tolerant and thrives in saline soils, making it an important species in desert ecosystems. Atriplex fasciculata also serves as a food source for various wildlife, including birds and small mammals."
