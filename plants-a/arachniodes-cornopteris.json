    "intro": "Arachniodes cornopteris, commonly known as the spider fern, is a species of fern native to Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble spider webs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique feature makes it a fascinating subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
