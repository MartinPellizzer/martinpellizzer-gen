It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming during the monsoon season. It thrives in moist, shaded forest environments and requires specific soil conditions for successful growth. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
