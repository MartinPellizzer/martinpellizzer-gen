It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and showy, pink or red silky flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces flat, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It has a shallow root system and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its aesthetic appeal. Albizia julibrissin is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plants."
