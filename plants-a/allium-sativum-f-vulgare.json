    "intro": "Allium sativum f. vulgare, commonly known as garlic, is a botanical variant of the garlic species characterized by its distinctively pungent aroma and flavor. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is native to Central Asia, though it is now cultivated worldwide. The plant features a bulb composed of multiple cloves, each encased in a papery, fibrous coating. Its leaves are hollow, grass-like, and typically grow in a rosette pattern. The flowers, when present, are small and white or pink, forming a spherical cluster at the top of the stem."
