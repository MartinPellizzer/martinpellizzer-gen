    "intro": "Amalias anceps, commonly known as the common lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found on bark, rocks, or soil surfaces. The structure of Amalias anceps consists of a dense, crust-like thallus that can vary in color from green to yellow or brown depending on the photosynthetic partner. It plays a crucial role in nutrient cycling and serves as a food source for various invertebrates. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is used as an indicator species for air quality."
