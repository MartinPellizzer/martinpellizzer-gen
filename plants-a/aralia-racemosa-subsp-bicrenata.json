    "intro": "Aralia racemosa subsp. bicrenata, commonly known as the red-spined aralia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically divided into several narrow, serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a panicle, which are followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas. The subspecies is distinguished by its unique red veins on the leaves, which give it its common name."
