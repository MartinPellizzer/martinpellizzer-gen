    "intro": "Auriculardisia glandulosomarginata, commonly known as the hairy-margin orchid, is a perennial herb native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, orchid-like flowers with a distinctive auriculate (ear-shaped) lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine, glandular hairs, contributing to its common name. The flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish-white, with a fragrant scent that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
