    "intro": "Alchemilla wallischii, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of soft, hairy leaves that form a dense, cushion-like structure. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are clustered in branched inflorescences. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. Alchemilla wallischii is often used in rock gardens and alpine gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
