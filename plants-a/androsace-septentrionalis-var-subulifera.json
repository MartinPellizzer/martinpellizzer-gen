    "intro": "Androsace septentrionalis var. subulifera, commonly known as the northern sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of northern Europe. It features dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a mat-forming habit with slender, hairy stems and needle-like leaves that help it survive in harsh, cold environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and tundra. Its botanical structure is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures, making it a characteristic component of alpine flora."
