    "intro": "Angraecum patens, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender, white or pale green inflorescence with showy, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or cream in color. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers emit a faint fragrance, which attracts specific nocturnal pollinators like moths. Angraecum patens is notable for its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat."
