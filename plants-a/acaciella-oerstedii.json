    "intro": "Acaciella oerstedii, commonly known as the Oersted's acacia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the island of Socotra. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its typical pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features compound leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. It is adapted to arid environments, showcasing drought resistance through its succulent stems and reduced leaves. This unique species is of interest to botanists due to its evolutionary adaptations and ecological significance in its native habitat.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaciella oerstedii is primarily native to the Caribbean, specifically the Greater Antilles. It is found in countries such as Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola, and Puerto Rico. This plant typically grows in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. It is often associated with sandy soils and can thrive in drier conditions. Its distribution is limited to these specific regions within the Caribbean archipelago.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaciella oerstedii was mainly introduced to the southern United States, particularly in Texas and Arizona, as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature. It has been widely cultivated in gardens and landscapes because of its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Although it is not considered invasive in most regions, it has been reported in several states where it has established itself in natural areas. The plant's distribution is primarily confined to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its introduction has been mostly intentional, with limited natural spread observed in the wild."
