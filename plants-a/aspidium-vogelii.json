    "intro": "Aspidium vogelii, commonly known as the Vogel's water fern, is a member of the family Pteridaceae and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant features a creeping rhizome with densely packed, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium. Aspidium vogelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
