    "intro": "Agropyron angarense, commonly known as the Altai wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It is adapted to harsh environments, including cold climates and poor soils. Agropyron angarense is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
