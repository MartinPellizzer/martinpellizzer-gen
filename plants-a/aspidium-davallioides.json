    "intro": "Aspidium davallioides, commonly known as the broad-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its large, compound fronds that are typically divided into numerous narrow, linear segments. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, fibrous sheath, which helps anchor it in moist, shaded environments. Aspidium davallioides thrives in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats where it can maintain the high humidity required for its growth."
