    "intro": "Alyssum montanum var. obovatum, commonly known as the mountain alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are typically oval or obovate in shape, with a slightly hairy texture. This variety thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its compact growth and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to both garden and natural habitats."
