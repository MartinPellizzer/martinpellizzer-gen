    "intro": "Artanthe adenophora, commonly known as the woolly artanthe, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowering stems are often covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Artanthe adenophora is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a resilient species in dry, mountainous regions."
