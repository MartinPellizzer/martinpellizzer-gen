    "intro": "Allium ampeloprasum var. bulbiferum, commonly known as the tree leek, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers in umbels, which are followed by spherical, purple berries. Its bulbs, which are edible, are often used in cooking, similar to leeks or onions. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens."
