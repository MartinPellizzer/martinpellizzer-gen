    "intro": "Agropyron badamense, commonly known as the Kashmir grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Himalayan regions of India and Pakistan. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Agropyron badamense is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in its native habitat."
