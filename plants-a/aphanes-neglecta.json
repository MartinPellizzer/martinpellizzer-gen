    "intro": "Aphanes neglecta, commonly known as the common sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its fruits are small, dry achenes that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across sandy or disturbed soils. Aphanes neglecta is often found in open habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and coastal areas."
