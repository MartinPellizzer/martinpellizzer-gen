    "intro": "Agropyron trachycaulum var. glaucum, commonly known as the blue wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered with a waxy coating. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It is well adapted to harsh environments, tolerating drought and poor soil conditions. This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological resilience and ability to stabilize soils."
