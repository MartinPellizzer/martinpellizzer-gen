    "intro": "Anthemis tomentosa subsp. peregrina, commonly known as the Desert Daisy, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of North America. It features silver-gray, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with a distinctive, often strong, aromatic scent. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its botanical characteristics reflect adaptations to survive in extreme desert conditions."
