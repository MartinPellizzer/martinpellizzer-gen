    "intro": "Aurelia squarrosa, commonly known as the rough sea nettle, is a species of jellyfish belonging to the family Pelagiiidae. It is characterized by its translucent, bell-shaped body and long, trailing tentacles that are used for capturing prey. The oral arms are lined with specialized cells called cnidocytes, which release toxins to immobilize small marine organisms. It thrives in coastal waters and is often found in the Atlantic and Mediterranean regions. This species plays an important role in marine ecosystems as both predator and prey."
