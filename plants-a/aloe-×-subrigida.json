    "intro": "Aloe \u00d7 subrigida, commonly known as the hybrid aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branching flower stalks that bear yellow or orange flowers, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that is used in various topical applications. Aloe \u00d7 subrigida is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
