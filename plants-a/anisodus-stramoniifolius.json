    "intro": "Anisodus stramoniifolius, commonly known as the Mexican devil's weed, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Solanaceae, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and lobed leaves that resemble those of the plantain. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale purple, followed by orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. It is known for its potent alkaloid content, including scopolamine and hyoscyamine, which have been used in traditional medicine and for recreational purposes. However, due to its toxic properties, it is considered a hazardous plant and should be handled with caution."
