    "intro": "Anchusa saxatilis, commonly known as the rock hyssop, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy, gray-green leaves that are adapted to rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces spikes of blue to violet flowers, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often found in dry, sunny habitats like cliffs and slopes. Anchusa saxatilis is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
