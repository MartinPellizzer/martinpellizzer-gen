    "intro": "Acrostichum langsdorffii, commonly known as the giant swamp fern, is a large, terrestrial fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in wet, shady environments such as swamps and marshes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in moist soil. The fronds are typically evergreen, providing year-round foliage in its natural habitat.",
