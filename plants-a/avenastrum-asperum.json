    "intro": "Avenastrum asperum, commonly known as rough fescue, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky, or disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Avenastrum asperum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a cover crop."
