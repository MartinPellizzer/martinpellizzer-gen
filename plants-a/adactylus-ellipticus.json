    "intro": "Adactylus ellipticus, commonly known as the elliptical leaf scale, is a species of scale insect belonging to the family Diaspididae. It is characterized by its elongated, elliptical body shape and a waxy, shield-like covering that protects its soft body. The plant it infests typically exhibits yellowing and deformation of leaves due to the insect's feeding habits. It is often found on various ornamental and fruit-bearing plants, making it a significant pest in horticulture. Its life cycle includes several stages, from egg to adult, with females remaining sessile throughout most of their lives.",
