    "intro": "Armatocereus brevispinus, commonly known as the short-spined night bloomer, is a cacti species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its short, spiny stems and is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It has a shallow root system adapted to survive in dry conditions. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it requires careful handling due to its spines."
