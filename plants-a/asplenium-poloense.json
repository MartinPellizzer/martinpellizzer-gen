    "intro": "Asplenium poloense, commonly known as the Polynesian spleenwort, is a member of the Aspleniaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds. It is a terrestrial or epiphytic fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with short, horizontal stems that produce both roots and new shoots. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a finely divided structure, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Asplenium poloense is noted for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
