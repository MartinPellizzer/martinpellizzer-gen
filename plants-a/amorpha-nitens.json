    "intro": "Amorpha nitens, commonly known as the yellow indigo bush, is a deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed structure and its clusters of bright yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Amorpha nitens is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
