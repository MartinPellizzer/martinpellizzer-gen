    "intro": "Asplenium rhizophorum var. radicans, commonly known as the creeping spleenwort, is a terrestrial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread horizontally along the soil surface. The plant produces small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This variant is often found in rocky crevices or along the bases of trees in temperate regions."
