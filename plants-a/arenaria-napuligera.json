    "intro": "Arenaria napuligera, commonly known as the Naples sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and alpine environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to its habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Arenaria napuligera is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in challenging environments."
