It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and aromatic, narrow leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical heads. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Due to its hardy nature and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated for use in herbal remedies."
