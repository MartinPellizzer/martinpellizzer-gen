    "intro": "Alchornea parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved alchorne, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2 to 5 meters. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Alchornea parvifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks."
