    "intro": "Asperula littoralis, commonly known as the coastal woodruff, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of western Europe. It features small, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, fragrant flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or sandy coastal habitats. Asperula littoralis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils against erosion."
