    "intro": "Aphora humilis, commonly known as the low aphora, is a small, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It typically grows close to the ground, with slender stems and small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish or pale yellow, adapted to attract specific pollinators. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Aphora humilis is well-suited to harsh environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
