    "intro": "Amauropelta nephelium, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a unique species belonging to the family Davalliaceae. It is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that resemble clouds, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Amauropelta nephelium thrives in humid environments and requires high levels of light and moisture for optimal growth."
