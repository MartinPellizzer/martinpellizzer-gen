    "intro": "Aphyllon tuberosum, commonly known as the tuberous aphyllon, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its lack of true leaves, instead featuring small, scale-like structures that cover its stems. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its tuberous roots are an important feature, storing nutrients and allowing the plant to survive harsh conditions. Aphyllon tuberosum is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and adaptability to dry, sunny environments."
