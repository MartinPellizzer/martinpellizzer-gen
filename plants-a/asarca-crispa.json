    "intro": "Asarca crispa, commonly known as the fragrant marsh plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a slightly serrated edge, while the flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in umbels. It produces tiny, three-lobed berries that are edible but have a mild, spicy flavor. This plant is often found in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is an important component of wetland ecosystems."
