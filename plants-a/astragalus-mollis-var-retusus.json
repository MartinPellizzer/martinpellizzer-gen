    "intro": "Astragalus mollis var. retusus, commonly known as the soft milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Astragalus mollis var. retusus is often found in grasslands, sandy soils, and along the edges of deserts."
