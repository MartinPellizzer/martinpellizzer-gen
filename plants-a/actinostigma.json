    "intro": "Actinostigma, commonly known as the \"milkweed of the desert,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its milky sap, which is a defining feature of the genus. The plants typically have opposite, simple leaves and produce showy, tubular flowers that are often brightly colored. Actinostigma species are native to arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in Africa and the Middle East. They are adapted to survive in harsh environments, with some species exhibiting succulent leaves to store water."
