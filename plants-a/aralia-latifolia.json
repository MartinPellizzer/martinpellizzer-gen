    "intro": "Aralia latifolia, commonly known as American aralia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves that can grow up to 30 inches long, with each leaflet being oval and serrated. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in late spring to early summer. These flowers are followed by spiny, berry-like fruits that ripen to red or black. Aralia latifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its shade and visual interest."
