    "intro": "Acaena lucida, commonly known as the shining weed, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and prickly, spherical fruits. The plant typically grows in moist, coastal environments and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The species is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena lucida is primarily native to Argentina South, Chile South, and Falkland Islands. This plant is commonly found in temperate regions of southern South America. It thrives in coastal and grassland habitats, often in areas with well-drained soils. Acaena lucida is adapted to the cool, maritime climate of these regions. Its distribution reflects its ecological preference for southern Patagonia and the subantarctic zones.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena lucida was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as a potential ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and compact growth habit. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation in certain areas. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is particularly common in coastal and disturbed habitats. Its rapid spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its impact on local ecosystems."
