It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are usually succulent, helping it retain moisture in dry conditions. This variety is noted for its compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in xerophytic landscapes."
