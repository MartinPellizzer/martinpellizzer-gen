    "intro": "Acer palmatum var. sessilifolium, commonly known as the Japanese maple with sessile leaves, is a deciduous ornamental tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its elegant, finely divided leaves that are typically sessile, meaning they attach directly to the stem without a petiole. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange-red samaras in the fall. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Its compact growth habit and vibrant seasonal color changes make it a prized addition to cultivated collections.",
