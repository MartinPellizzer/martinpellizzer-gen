    "intro": "Ammi meoides, commonly known as hoary alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a low-growing annual herb with grayish-white, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow or white, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. Ammi meoides is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and roadsides."
