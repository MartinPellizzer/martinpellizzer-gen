    "intro": "Arabis oblanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features basal leaves that are oblanceolate in shape, with a bluish-green hue, and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine arrangements. Arabis oblanceolata is also valued for its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
