    "intro": "Asplenium brassii, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are located on the undersides of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Asplenium brassii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant."
