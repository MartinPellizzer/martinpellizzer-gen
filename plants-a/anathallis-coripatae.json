    "intro": "Anathallis coripatae, commonly known as the Andean ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Peru. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white, ghost-like flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Anathallis coripatae is noted for its unique morphology, with a short, slender stem and a single, showy flower that resembles a ghostly figure. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
