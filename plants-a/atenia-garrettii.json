    "intro": "Atenia garrettii, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a succulent native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a compact, spiny stem that branches into short, fleshy segments. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in its harsh environment. Atenia garrettii is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance."
