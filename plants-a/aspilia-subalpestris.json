    "intro": "Aspilia subalpestris, commonly known as the Alpine torchflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf structures. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The flower heads are yellow to orange in color, forming a striking display that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
