    "intro": "Aristolochia pseudoutriformis, commonly known as the false Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and its unique, horseshoe-shaped flowers that are often maroon or purple in color. The plant belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is known for its complex, winding growth habit. Its flowers are adapted to attract specific pollinators, such as flies and beetles, rather than bees or butterflies. The genus Aristolochia includes several species with medicinal properties, though many are toxic."
