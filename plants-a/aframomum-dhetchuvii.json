It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, finger-like rhizomes. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically followed by red, fleshy berries. Its rhizomes are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, similar to cardamom. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitats."
