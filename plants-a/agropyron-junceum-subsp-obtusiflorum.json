    "intro": "Agropyron junceum subsp. obtusiflorum, commonly known as the broad-flower wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences with small, greenish to brownish flowers. Its flowers are characterized by their broad, rounded lobes, which give the subspecies its common name. This grass is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
