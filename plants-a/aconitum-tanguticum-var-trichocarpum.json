    "intro": "Aconitum tanguticum var. trichocarpum, commonly known as the Tibetan monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its striking purple-blue flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape, typical of the Aconitum genus. The plant features large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, woolly hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is handled with care and is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes.",
