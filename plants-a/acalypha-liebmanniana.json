    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha liebmanniana is primarily native to Mexico Central, Mexico Gulf, and Mexico Southwest. This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forests or along riverbanks. The species is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage. Its native range reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of central and southern Mexico.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha liebmanniana was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and unique leaf patterns. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions as a decorative plant. The species has been widely distributed in gardens and green spaces across Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of the United States. Its introduction has led to its establishment in some natural areas, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. Despite its ornamental value, careful management is recommended to prevent its spread into native ecosystems."
