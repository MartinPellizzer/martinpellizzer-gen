    "intro": "Astragalus brachycalyx var. muticus, commonly known as the short calyx milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and its root system is deep and fibrous, adapted to survive in dry conditions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
