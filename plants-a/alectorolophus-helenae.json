    "intro": "Alectorolophus helenae, commonly known as the Helen's orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
