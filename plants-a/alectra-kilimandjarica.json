    "intro": "Alectra kilimandjarica, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro alectra, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps to reduce water loss. Alectra kilimandjarica is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
