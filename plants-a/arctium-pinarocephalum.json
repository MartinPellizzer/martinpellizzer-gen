    "intro": "Arctium pinarocephalum, commonly known as the Italian burdock, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features a tall, hollow stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height, covered with coarse, hairy texture. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface and thick, spiny bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a composite inflorescence typical of the Asteraceae family. The plant is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its anti-inflammatory and detoxifying effects."
