    "intro": "Acanthopanax stenophyllus f. dilatatus, commonly known as the broad-leafed Chinese angel's trumpet, is a variant of the Chinese angel's trumpet plant. It is characterized by its broad, elliptical leaves that are often slightly lobed. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by red berries.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthopanax stenophyllus f. dilatatus is primarily native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan. It thrives in temperate climates and is commonly found in forests and rocky areas at higher elevations. This plant is particularly associated with the Korean Peninsula and southern parts of the Chinese mainland. It prefers well-drained soil and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its natural range reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecological conditions of these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopanax stenophyllus f. dilatatus was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and hardy nature. It is commonly found in gardens and greenhouses across the eastern and southern regions of the country. This plant is often cultivated for its aesthetic value rather than for agricultural or medicinal purposes. However, it has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential to become invasive in certain environments. Its distribution remains largely confined to cultivated areas, though it has occasionally escaped into the wild."
