    "intro": "Acaena tenera, commonly known as New Zealand burr or mountain burr, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and persistent, bristly foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive, spiny fruits that contain seeds. Acaena tenera thrives in moist, cool environments and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of New Zealand's native flora.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena tenera is primarily native to Argentina South and Chile South. This plant is commonly found in the temperate regions of these countries. It thrives in grasslands and shrublands, often in areas with well-drained soils. The species is well adapted to the climate and environmental conditions of southern South America. Its distribution reflects its natural habitat preferences in this region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena tenera was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century. The plant was initially cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive yellow flowers. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local biodiversity and land management."
