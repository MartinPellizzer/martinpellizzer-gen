It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaves. The plant produces a tall, spathate inflorescence with a single, showy white spathe and a spadix that bears small, greenish flowers. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is adapted to semi-shaded environments. Due to its unique morphology and habitat specificity, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
