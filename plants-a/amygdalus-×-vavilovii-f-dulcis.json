    "intro": "Amygdalus \u00d7 vavilovii f. dulcis, commonly known as the sweet almond, is a hybrid species within the Prunus genus. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped nuts that are encased in a hard shell. The plant produces fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are followed by the development of its edible nuts. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This variety is widely cultivated for its nut production and is an important ancestor in the development of modern almond cultivars."
