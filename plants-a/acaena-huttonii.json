This plant thrives in rocky and gravelly soils at high elevations. It is commonly associated with open vegetation types such as grasslands and shrublands. Acaena huttonii is an important component of the native flora in these environments.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena huttonii was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the colonial period. The plant is now found in various regions across the country, particularly in the North Island. It has adapted well to the local climate and soil conditions. However, it is considered a potential weed in some areas due to its aggressive growth habit."
