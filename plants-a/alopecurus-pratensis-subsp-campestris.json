    "intro": "Alopecurus pratensis subsp. campestris, commonly known as meadow foxtail, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist meadows, pastures, and along streambanks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are often mistaken for foxtail grass due to their similar appearance. It is characterized by its tufted inflorescence and is often found in temperate climates. This subspecies is valued for its role in ecological restoration and as a forage crop for livestock."
