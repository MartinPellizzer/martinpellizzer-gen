    "intro": "Anemonoides exigua, commonly known as the dwarf anemone, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features delicate, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters atop short, hairy stems. The plant has basal leaves that are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
