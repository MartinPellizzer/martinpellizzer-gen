    "intro": "Ampelosicyos meridionalis, commonly known as the desert bottle tree, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, adding a striking visual element to its otherwise spiny appearance. Its unique morphology, including its bottle-shaped trunk and trailing branches, makes it a distinctive and visually appealing species. Ampelosicyos meridionalis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its resilience and aesthetic value."
