    "intro": "Antennaria breitungii, commonly known as the Breitwitz sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate habit and small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are often lobed, adapted to thrive in rocky or sandy soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it tolerates cold temperatures and poor soil conditions. Antennaria breitungii plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to harsh climates."
