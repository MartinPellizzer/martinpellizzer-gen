    "intro": "Arabis lactea, commonly known as the milky rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers. The plant is adapted to rocky and arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh conditions. Its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals, gives it its common name. Arabis lactea is often found in alpine meadows and is an important part of the local flora in its native habitat."
