It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its auriculate (ear-shaped) leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or purple. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
