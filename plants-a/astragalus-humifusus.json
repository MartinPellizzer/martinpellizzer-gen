    "intro": "Astragalus humifusus, commonly known as the low-growing milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features a mat-forming growth habit with small, palmately lobed leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Astragalus humifusus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
