It features delicate, feathery plumes of pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often variegated with silver or white markings. It prefers partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it ideal for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its soft, flowing foliage and subtle floral display."
