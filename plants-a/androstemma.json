    "intro": "Androstemma, commonly known as the false arrowhead, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia. The plants are characterized by their palmate leaves, which often resemble the shape of an arrowhead, and their showy, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Androstemma species are typically herbaceous, with some varieties growing as shrubs, and they often thrive in moist, shaded environments. These plants are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value due to their distinctive foliage and delicate blooms."
