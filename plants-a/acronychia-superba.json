    "intro": "Acronychia superba, commonly known as the rock apple or mountain apple, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to eastern Australia and is characterized by its rugged, shrub-like appearance with rough, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical fruits that contain several seeds. Acronychia superba is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in dry, well-drained soils, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Its hardy nature makes it a resilient plant in its native habitat.",
