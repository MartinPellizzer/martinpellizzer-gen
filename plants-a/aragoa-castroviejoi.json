    "intro": "Aragoa castroviejoi, commonly known as the Castroviejo's aragoa, is a rare flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in the unique microclimates of its endemic habitat. Its leaves are usually lanceolate and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
