    "intro": "Avena involucrata, commonly known as the bearded oat, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive, hairy inflorescence that resembles a beard. The plant produces spikelets that are often encased in a pale, woolly bract, giving it its common name. Avena involucrata typically thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and potential use in restoration projects."
