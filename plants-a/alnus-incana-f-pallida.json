    "intro": "Alnus incana f. pallida, commonly known as the white-leaf alder, is a shrub or small tree native to northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its pale, silvery-gray leaves that distinguish it from other alder species. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along streams. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by spherical cones that release seeds in the fall. This species plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife."
