It features spiky, upright stems with fleshy, sword-shaped leaves that are typically green with a reddish tinge. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellow or orange flowers, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and being drought-tolerant. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional medicinal uses in some cultures."
