    "intro": "Athyrium ottonis, commonly known as the silver lace fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in a silvery bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is commonly found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Athyrium ottonis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
