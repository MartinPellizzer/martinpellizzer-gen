    "intro": "Aspalathus variegata, commonly known as the rooibos plant, is a shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and is well adapted to the region's Mediterranean climate. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red-brown pods containing seeds. It is particularly notable for its unique ability to thrive in poor, sandy soils. Aspalathus variegata is most famous for being the source of rooibos tea, which is caffeine-free and rich in antioxidants."
