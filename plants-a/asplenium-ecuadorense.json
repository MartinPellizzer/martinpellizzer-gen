    "intro": "Asplenium ecuadorense, commonly known as the Ecuadorian spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. It produces spores in clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the wet season. Asplenium ecuadorense is native to the Andean regions of Ecuador and is adapted to the humid, cool climate of its native habitat."
