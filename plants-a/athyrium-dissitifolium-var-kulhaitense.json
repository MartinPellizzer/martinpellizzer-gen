    "intro": "Athyrium dissitifolium var. kulhaitense, commonly known as the Kulhaiten fern, is a variant of the broadleaf fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of small, scale-like structures. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its aesthetic qualities."
