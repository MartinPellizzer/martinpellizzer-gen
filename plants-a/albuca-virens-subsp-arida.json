It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, linear leaves that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry climates."
