    "intro": "Astragalus gonggamontis, commonly known as the Gonggang Mountain milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the legume family. It is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at higher elevations, where it thrives in dry and sunny conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
