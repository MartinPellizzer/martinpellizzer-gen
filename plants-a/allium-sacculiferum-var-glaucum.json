    "intro": "Allium sacculiferum var. glaucum, commonly known as the blue globemallow, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has gray-green, fuzzy leaves that are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, bulbous structures at the base. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
