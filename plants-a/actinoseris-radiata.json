It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, inconspicuous fruiting structures called achenes. Actinoseris radiata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.",
