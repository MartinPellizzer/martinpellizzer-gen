    "intro": "Acaena quinquefida, commonly known as the five-lobed burrplant, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense clusters of small, spiny fruits that form persistent burrs. The plant has compound leaves with five leaflets, which are typically hairy and lance-shaped. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine environments. Acaena quinquefida plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena quinquefida is primarily native to New Zealand. It is commonly found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury and Otago regions. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes, gravelly soils, and coastal areas. It is often associated with native grasslands and shrublands. Acaena quinquefida plays an important ecological role in its native environment, providing food for various bird species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena quinquefida was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and dense growth habit. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in coastal and inland areas. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can tolerate both full sun and partial shade. Its rapid spread has led to concerns about its impact on local ecosystems and biodiversity."
