    "intro": "Acantholimon kjurendaghi, commonly known as the Kjurendaghi's thornweed, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to arid conditions. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",

It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in mountainous or desert landscapes. The plant is adapted to the harsh climate conditions of Turkmenistan. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon kjurendaghi was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its attractive silvery foliage and showy flowers. It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas, particularly in southern Europe and parts of North Africa. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. However, it has shown invasive tendencies in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact."
