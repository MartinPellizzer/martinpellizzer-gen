    "intro": "Angraecum pugioniforme, commonly known as the sword orchid, is a species of orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white or pale green pubescence. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale blue with a distinctive, elongated spur. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic. Angraecum pugioniforme is well adapted to the humid, shaded environments of its native habitat."
