    "intro": "Achnatherum papposum, commonly known as bottlebrush grass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dense, fluffy seed heads that resemble bottle brushes, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray sheen, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Achnatherum papposum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals.",
