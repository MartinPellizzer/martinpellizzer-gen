    "intro": "Andropogon nardus var. stenanthus, commonly known as narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes and swampy areas, preferring moist, acidic soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its growth habit makes it a valuable component of wetland restoration projects."
