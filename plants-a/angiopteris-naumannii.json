    "intro": "Angiopteris naumannii, commonly known as the Naumann's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dennstaedtiaceae. It is characterized by its large, dichotomously branched fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its leaves are pinnately divided and have a distinctive, feathery appearance. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
