    "intro": "Aechmea weilbachii, commonly known as the velvet plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage, which forms a central cup that collects rainwater. The leaves are thick, fleshy, and often have a velvety texture, giving the plant its common name. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
