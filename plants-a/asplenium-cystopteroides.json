    "intro": "Asplenium cystopteroides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear to lanceolate leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Asplenium cystopteroides is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
