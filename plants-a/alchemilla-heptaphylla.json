    "intro": "Alchemilla heptaphylla, commonly known as the seven-leaf sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in early summer, typically in clusters at the base of the leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Alchemilla heptaphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
