    "intro": "Alopecurus paludosus, commonly known as soft hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats across Europe, Asia, and North America. It typically grows in marshes, fens, and other moist environments, often forming dense, low-growing tussocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive hairy texture, especially on the lower stems. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Alopecurus paludosus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
