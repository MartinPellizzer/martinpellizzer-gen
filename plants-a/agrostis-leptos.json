    "intro": "Agrostis leptos, commonly known as slender meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted shoots with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is usually terminal and contains two to three small florets. Agrostis leptos is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
