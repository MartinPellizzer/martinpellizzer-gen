    "intro": "Artemisia adamsii, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in panicles, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Artemisia adamsii is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
