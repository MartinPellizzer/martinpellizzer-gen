    "intro": "Asplenium sarelii subsp. sarelii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a perennial fern native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, woolly layer of roots, which helps in anchoring it to its substrate. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
