    "intro": "Avena sativa var. arduennensis, commonly known as the Arduennian oat, is a rare botanical variant of the common oat. It is characterized by its slender stalks and compact, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in temperate regions with well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, while its seeds are small and oval-shaped. Due to its limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
