It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in montane forests. The bark of Acer metcalfii is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming more rugged with age.",
