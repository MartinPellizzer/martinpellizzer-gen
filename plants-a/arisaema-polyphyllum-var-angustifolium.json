It features a tuberous rhizome and produces striking, hooded spathes that enclose its spadix, a characteristic feature of the Araceae family. The plant's leaves are typically lanceolate and arranged in a rosette, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturalists alike."
