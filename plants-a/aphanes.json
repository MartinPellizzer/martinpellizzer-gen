These plants are characterized by their small, fleshy leaves and clusters of tiny white flowers. They are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Aphanes species are typically low-growing and have a mat-forming habit. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional herbal medicine."
