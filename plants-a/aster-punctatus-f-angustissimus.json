    "intro": "Aster punctatus f. angustissimus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved aster, is a variant of the aster species characterized by its slender, elongated leaves. This plant is native to the western United States, particularly in regions with dry, rocky soils. Its flowers are typically blue to purple in color, with ray florets that are shorter than those of the typical aster. The leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is a perennial plant that thrives in full sun and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands."
