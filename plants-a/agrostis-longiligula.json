    "intro": "Agrostis longiligula, commonly known as slender spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Agrostis longiligula is often found in wetland ecosystems and is an important component of aquatic and semi-aquatic plant communities."
