    "intro": "Armeria sardoa var. nebrodensis, commonly known as the Sicilian sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the island of Sicily. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This variety is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
