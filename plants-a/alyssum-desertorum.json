    "intro": "Alyssum desertorum, commonly known as desert alyssum, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically features small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in early spring. The plant has succulent-like leaves that help it conserve water, adapting to its harsh environment. It produces numerous small seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its survival in disturbed soils. Alyssum desertorum is often found in sandy or rocky habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native range."
