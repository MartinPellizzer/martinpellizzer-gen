    "intro": "Acer johnedwardianum, commonly known as Edward's maple, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters, characterized by its slender trunk and delicate, palmate leaves. The leaves are usually green in summer and turn vibrant red or orange in autumn, adding to its ornamental value. It prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.",
