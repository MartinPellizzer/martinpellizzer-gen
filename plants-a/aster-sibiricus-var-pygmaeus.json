    "intro": "Aster sibiricus var. pygmaeus, commonly known as the Siberian dwarf aster, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with slender, hairy stems and small, clustered flower heads. The plant produces blue to purple ray flowers surrounded by yellow disk flowers, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
