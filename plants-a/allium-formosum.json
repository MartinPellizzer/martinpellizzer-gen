It is native to China and is characterized by its tall, cylindrical bulbs that are typically purple or pink in color. The plant produces grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in summer. It is often cultivated for its edible bulbs, which have a mild, sweet flavor. Allium formosum is also valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
