    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha schiedeana var. latifolia is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in lowland forests and along stream banks. This variant is particularly common in the island of Borneo, where it grows in dense undergrowth. It is also present in parts of the Indian subcontinent, though less frequently. The plant is well adapted to moist, nutrient-rich soils and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitats.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha schiedeana var. latifolia was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage. It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas in countries such as Australia, the United States, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in warm climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is often used in ornamental horticulture for its vibrant leaf colors and unique growth form. However, it has raised concerns in some areas due to its potential to become invasive if not managed properly."
