    "intro": "Aulonemia hirtula, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. This plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. It thrives in nutrient-rich substrates and is often found in slow-moving or still water. Aulonemia hirtula plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
