    "intro": "Anacampseros humilis, commonly known as the dwarf ice plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, basal leaves that form a rosette, and it produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Anacampseros humilis is also known for its ability to survive in harsh, dry conditions with minimal water."
