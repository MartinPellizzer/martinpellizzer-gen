    "intro": "Aira minuta, commonly known as little air grass, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich soils. Aira minuta is generally short-lived, with a growth cycle that is closely tied to seasonal changes in moisture and temperature."
