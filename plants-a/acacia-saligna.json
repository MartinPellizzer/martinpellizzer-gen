    "intro": "Acacia saligna, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and feathery, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its bark is smooth and greyish, often shedding in strips, and it is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Acacia saligna is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a source of timber and fodder.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia saligna is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the coastal and inland regions of the state, particularly in sandy soils. This plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including woodlands, heathlands, and coastal dunes. It is well adapted to the dry and arid conditions of the region. Acacia saligna plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia saligna was mainly introduced to regions across the Mediterranean, parts of Africa, and several areas in South and North America. It has been established in countries such as Albania, Algeria, Angola, and Argentina, particularly in the northeastern region. The plant is also found in the Canary Islands, California, and various parts of Europe, including France, Italy, and Spain. It has been introduced to Australia in states like New South Wales, Queensland, and South Australia. Additionally, it is present in parts of the Middle East, such as Saudi Arabia and Yemen, and in regions like Kenya and Tanzania."
