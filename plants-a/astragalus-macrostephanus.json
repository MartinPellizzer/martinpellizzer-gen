    "intro": "Astragalus macrostephanus, commonly known as the large-headed milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its robust, upright stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical heads. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. Astragalus macrostephanus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
