It typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, fields, and meadows. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or blue. Its inflorescence consists of a single, loose panicle bearing small, spikelet-like flowers. Agrostis meionectes is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in marginal habitats."
