    "intro": "Acalypha deltoidea, commonly known as the deltoid ironleaf, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its deltoid-shaped leaves, which are typically green with a distinctive reddish or purplish underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along streambanks. Acalypha deltoidea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",

This plant thrives in humid and shaded environments. It is often seen growing along riverbanks and in dense undergrowth. Its native distribution is largely restricted to the central and western regions of DR Congo.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha deltoidea was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and unique leaf shapes. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions as a decorative plant. The species has been reported in several countries, including the United States, Australia, and parts of Southeast Asia. Its introduction has sometimes led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain environments. Proper management is recommended to prevent unintended spread."
