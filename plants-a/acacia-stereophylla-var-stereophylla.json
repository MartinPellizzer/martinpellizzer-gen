It is found in the southern regions of the state, particularly in the coastal and near-coastal areas. This variety thrives in sandy soils and is commonly associated with heathlands and shrublands. It is well adapted to the dry and Mediterranean climate of the region. The plant is an important component of the local flora and supports a variety of wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia stereophylla var. stereophylla was mainly introduced to areas with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in coastal regions and rocky habitats. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive foliage and ability to withstand drought conditions. It has been introduced to several parts of California and the western United States. However, it is considered invasive in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation."
