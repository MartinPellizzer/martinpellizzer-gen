    "intro": "Aster novi-belgii subsp. laevigatus, commonly known as the smoothleaf New York aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It features showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. The subspecies is characterized by its smooth, hairless leaves, which distinguish it from other members of the Aster novi-belgii species complex. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. This plant plays a vital role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during its flowering season."
