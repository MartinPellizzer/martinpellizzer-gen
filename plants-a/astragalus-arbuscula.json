    "intro": "Astragalus arbuscula, commonly known as the tree milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its woody, shrub-like growth habit and is often found in rocky soils and dry landscapes. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its trifoliate leaves and ability to fix nitrogen make it an important plant in soil stabilization and ecological restoration. Astragalus arbuscula is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices."
