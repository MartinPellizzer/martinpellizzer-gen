    "intro": "Adonis autumnalis var. baetica, commonly known as the Iberian adonis, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal. It is characterized by its basal rosette of blue-green leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers in the autumn. The plant thrives in rocky, calcareous soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine. However, it is considered rare and is protected in some regions due to habitat loss.",
