It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, large, and often woolly leaves. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically yellow or cream in color. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
