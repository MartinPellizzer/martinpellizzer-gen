    "intro": "Anthemis rigida subsp. antri-neptuni, commonly known as the Neptune's Anchovy, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces small, yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant features silver-gray foliage with a fine, fuzzy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in Mediterranean climates."
