    "intro": "Ageratina gilbertii, commonly known as Gilbert's blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that are clustered in a spherical shape, giving it a mist-like appearance. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. Ageratina gilbertii is often found in moist woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
