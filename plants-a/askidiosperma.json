    "intro": "Askidiosperma, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or *Pau-Brasil*, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its straight, dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its rich color and durability. The tree has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elongated pods. Its bark is thick and fissured, and the plant is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often reaching over 100 years. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species and is protected in many regions."
