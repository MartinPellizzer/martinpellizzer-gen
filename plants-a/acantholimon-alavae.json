    "intro": "Acantholimon alavae, commonly known as the Alava thornedweed, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. This species is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces small, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, and it is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils. It is often found in open habitats such as coastal dunes and scrublands.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon alavae is primarily native to Iran. This plant is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the Alborz and Zagros mountain ranges. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing in dry, well-drained soils. The species is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of these areas, including high altitudes and limited rainfall. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in Iran.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon alavae was mainly introduced to areas with rocky or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as slopes, cliffs, and disturbed ground. It thrives in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. This plant is commonly found in southern Europe, particularly in Spain and southern France. It is typically associated with limestone or calcareous substrates, which provide the necessary mineral content for its growth. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often limited to localized populations in these environments."
