It is found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in the area known as the Geraldton-Walpole region. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas. It is commonly associated with shrublands and open woodlands. Its distribution is limited to this specific geographic region within Western Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon lobulatum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and streambanks. The plant has become naturalized in several counties in Oregon and Washington. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil types contribute to its spread. It is considered a potential invasive species in some regions due to its competitive nature."
