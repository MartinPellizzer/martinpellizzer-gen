It produces dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
