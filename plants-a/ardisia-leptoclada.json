    "intro": "Ardisia leptoclada, commonly known as the slenderleaf evergreen, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside. Its small, white flowers are followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Ardisia leptoclada is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
