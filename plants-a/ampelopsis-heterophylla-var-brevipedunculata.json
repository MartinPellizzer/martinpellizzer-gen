    "intro": "Ampelopsis heterophylla var. brevipedunculata, commonly known as the broadleaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It features heart-shaped to ovate leaves that vary in size and shape along the stems, giving it its heterophyllous characteristic. The plant produces small, fragrant yellowish-green flowers in late summer, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes. Its vigorous growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in shaded areas."
