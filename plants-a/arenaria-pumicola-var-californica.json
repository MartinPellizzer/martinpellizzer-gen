    "intro": "Arenaria pumicola var. californica, commonly known as the California sandstone pink, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, often found in coastal and inland areas. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is well adapted to coastal environments and is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
