It is characterized by its slender, aromatic stems and compound leaves with finely divided, feathery lobes. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its roots and leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their digestive and diuretic properties. Apium maritimum thrives in sandy or saline soils and is well adapted to coastal environments."
