    "intro": "Acantholimon longiscapum, commonly known as the long-stemmed sandthrift, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, blue or violet flowers. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in dry landscapes.",

It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the country, particularly in the northern and western parts. This plant thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often growing in mountainous and coastal areas. It is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in Pakistan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon longiscapum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full to partial sun exposure, typically in regions with a Mediterranean climate. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas or along cliffs. This plant is commonly used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of California and the Pacific Northwest. Due to its hardiness, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and erosion control in arid environments."
