    "intro": "Avena sibirica, commonly known as Siberian oat, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in alpine or arctic regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a forage crop or for erosion control."
