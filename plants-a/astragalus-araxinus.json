    "intro": "Astragalus araxinus, commonly known as the Armenian milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish to greenish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces narrow, elongated pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Astragalus araxinus is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and its potential medicinal properties."
