    "intro": "Anguria guianensis, commonly known as the Guianan bitter melon, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers, squashes, and gourds. The plant produces elongated, ridged fruits that are typically green when mature, with a bitter taste due to the presence of cucurbitacins. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with five petals. The plant is often cultivated for its edible fruits, though they are generally less commonly consumed compared to other cucurbits."
