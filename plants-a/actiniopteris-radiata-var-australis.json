    "intro": "Actiniopteris radiata var. australis, commonly known as the Australian shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically divided into segments with a distinctive, toothed margin. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its fronds are often bioluminescent in the dark, a feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This fern plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various invertebrates and small vertebrates.",
