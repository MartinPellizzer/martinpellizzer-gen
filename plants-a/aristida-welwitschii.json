    "intro": "Aristida welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitsch grass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in restoration ecology and as a forage plant for livestock."
