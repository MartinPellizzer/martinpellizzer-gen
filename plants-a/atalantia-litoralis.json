    "intro": "Atalantia litoralis, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or red. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to salt spray and coastal winds. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer that helps reduce water loss. Atalantia litoralis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
