It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, spiky clusters. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soils. It is often found in rocky or sandy habitats and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
