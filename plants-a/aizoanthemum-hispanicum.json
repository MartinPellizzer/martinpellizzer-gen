    "intro": "Aizoanthemum hispanicum, commonly known as the Spanish ice plant, is a succulent plant native to southern Europe and North Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Aizoanthemum hispanicum is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its compact growth and ornamental appearance."
