It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine regions. The plant features basal leaves that are hairy and lobed, with a rosette structure that helps it retain moisture. Its flowers are white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters and resembling miniature daisies. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
