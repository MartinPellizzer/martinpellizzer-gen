    "intro": "Anoectochilus regalis var. cordatus, commonly known as the heart-shaped orchid, is a rare and exquisite orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique heart-shaped leaves, which are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a subtle violet hue. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in specialized horticultural settings."
