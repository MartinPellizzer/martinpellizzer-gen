    "intro": "Agave angustissima var. ortgiesiana, commonly known as the narrowleaf agave, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear small, white flowers, which are often followed by the development of fleshy, spiky fruits. It is a succulent plant, adapted to store water in its thick, fleshy leaves. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional practices and as a source of fiber."
