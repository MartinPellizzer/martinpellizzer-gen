    "intro": "Achillea \u00d7 portae, commonly known as the hybrid yarrow, is a perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a cross between Achillea millefolium (common yarrow) and Achillea ptarmica (chicory yarrow), resulting in a plant with distinctive foliage and floral characteristics. The leaves are finely divided and fern-like, while the flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in flat-topped clusters. This hybrid is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It also attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a beneficial addition to ecological landscapes.",
