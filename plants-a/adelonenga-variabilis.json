    "intro": "Adelonenga variabilis, commonly known as the variable adelonenga, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Due to habitat loss, Adelonenga variabilis is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.",
