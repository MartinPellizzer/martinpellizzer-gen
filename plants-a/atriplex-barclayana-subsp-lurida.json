    "intro": "Atriplex barclayana subsp. lurida, commonly known as the desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically in the spring. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in soils with high salinity. The species is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for wildlife."
