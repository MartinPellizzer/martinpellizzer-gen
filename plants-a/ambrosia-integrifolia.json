    "intro": "Ambrosia integrifolia, commonly known as smooth Ambrosia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical heads, which are typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its allergenic pollen, it is considered a significant weed in many regions."
