    "intro": "Astracantha parnassi subsp. cyllenea, commonly known as the Parnassian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered with fine hairs, while its stems are slender and often branched. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
