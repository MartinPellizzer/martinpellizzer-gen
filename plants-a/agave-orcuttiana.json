    "intro": "Agave orcuttiana, commonly known as Orcutt's agave, is a species of succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-forming structure with thick, fleshy leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears numerous white or yellowish flowers, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Agave orcuttiana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscapes due to its drought tolerance."
