    "intro": "Arenaria glabrescens, commonly known as sand pink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and North America. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with its compact growth habit. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the stems are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs that help reduce water loss. Arenaria glabrescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
