    "intro": "Achillea clavennae f. volujakensis, commonly known as the Volujakens form of the Narrow-leaved Yarrow, is a holarctic plant characterized by its compact growth habit and finely divided, gray-green foliage. It typically produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. The plant is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its botanical features include narrow, linear leaves and a mat-forming growth pattern that helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. This form is considered a natural variant of Achillea clavennae, exhibiting slight morphological differences from the typical species.",
