    "intro": "Aggeianthus, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots and showy, velvety leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and purple. Aggeianthus species are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their compact growth habit and vibrant blooms. They thrive in bright, indirect light and require well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
