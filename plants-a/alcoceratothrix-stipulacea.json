    "intro": "Alcoceratothrix stipulacea, commonly known as the stipule-bearing alcoholic plant, is a unique species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. Its stipules, which are leaf-like structures at the base of the leaves, are a distinguishing feature. Alcoceratothrix stipulacea is adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical or subtropical forests."
