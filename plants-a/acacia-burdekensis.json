    "intro": "Acacia burdekensis, commonly known as the Burdekin acacia, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to northern Australia, particularly the Queensland region, and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its yellow flowers are arranged in spherical or cylindrical clusters, and it produces long, slender pods that contain seeds. Acacia burdekensis is well adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia burdekensis is primarily native to Queensland. It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the state, particularly in the Simpson Desert and surrounding areas. This species thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to the harsh, dry conditions of the Australian outback. It is commonly found in shrublands and open woodlands. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within Queensland.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia burdekensis was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has been planted for ornamental purposes and as a source of timber. It is also found in parts of Australia, where it has been introduced for similar reasons. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it suitable for reforestation and land stabilization projects. However, it has shown invasive tendencies in some regions, posing a threat to native vegetation. Its distribution is primarily confined to areas with suitable climatic conditions and human intervention."
