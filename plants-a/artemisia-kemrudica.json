    "intro": "Artemisia kemrudica, commonly known as the Kashmiri wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its aromatic, silvery-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. It contains volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its medicinal and aromatic properties. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
