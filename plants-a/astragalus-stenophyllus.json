    "intro": "Astragalus stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Its leaves are narrow and compound, typically consisting of several pairs of small, bean-shaped leaflets. Astragalus stenophyllus is adapted to dry environments and plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat."
