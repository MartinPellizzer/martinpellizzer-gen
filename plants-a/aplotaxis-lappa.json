It belongs to the family Papaveraceae and is characterized by its yellow flowers and fleshy, lobed leaves. The plant contains alkaloids and is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Its latex sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making it a plant to handle with care."
