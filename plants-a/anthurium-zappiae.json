    "intro": "Anthurium zappiae, commonly known as the Zappia arrowhead, is a tropical plant native to Colombia. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a reddish or purple tinge on the underside. The plant produces striking spathes that can range in color from white to deep red, often resembling a flower but actually being modified leaves. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium zappiae is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
