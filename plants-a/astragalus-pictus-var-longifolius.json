It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and trifoliate leaves with long, narrow leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow to cream-colored flowers in raceme clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
