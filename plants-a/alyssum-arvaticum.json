    "intro": "Alyssum arvaticum, commonly known as desert alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in spring. The plant has compact, silver-gray foliage with a woolly texture, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers. Alyssum arvaticum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
