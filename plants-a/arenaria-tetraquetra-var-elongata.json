    "intro": "Arenaria tetraquetra var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features dense clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, hairless stems that often lie close to the ground, forming a mat-like structure. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, adapted to withstand harsh, cold environments. This variety is characterized by its elongated leaf shape, distinguishing it from other members of the Arenaria species."
