    "intro": "Amphithalea pageae, commonly known as the Page's amphithalea, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors. The plant features small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by narrow, grass-like leaves. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, its survival is highly threatened, prompting efforts for its protection and study."
