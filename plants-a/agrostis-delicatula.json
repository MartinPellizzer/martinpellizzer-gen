    "intro": "Agrostis delicatula, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in moist, disturbed soils such as along riverbanks and in meadows. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences that produce tiny grains. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects. Agrostis delicatula is also valued as a forage plant for livestock due to its nutritional content and hardiness."
