    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 luerssenii, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum. It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Aspleniaceae family. Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for survival."
