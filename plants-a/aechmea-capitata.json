    "intro": "Aechmea capitata, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears showy, brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from intense sunlight. Aechmea capitata is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
