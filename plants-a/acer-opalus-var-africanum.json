It features a distinctive umbrella-shaped crown and smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are palmately lobed, turning vibrant shades of red and orange in the autumn. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types.",
