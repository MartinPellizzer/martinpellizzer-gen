    "intro": "Acer hyrcanum subsp. tauricola, commonly known as the Tauric maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along riverbanks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in temperate climates.",
