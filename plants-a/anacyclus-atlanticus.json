It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and herbaceous growth habit. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy seed heads that disperse via the wind. Anacyclus atlanticus thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salt exposure. Its botanical features make it an important component of coastal ecosystems and a subject of ecological study."
