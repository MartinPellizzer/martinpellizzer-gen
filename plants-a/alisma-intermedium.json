    "intro": "Alisma intermedium, commonly known as the water plantain, is a semi-aquatic herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It has long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette at the water's surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer, usually in clusters at the base of the leaves. Its rhizomatous root system helps it anchor in muddy substrates and absorb nutrients from the water. Alisma intermedium is often used in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
