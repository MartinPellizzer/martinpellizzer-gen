    "intro": "Allotropa virgata, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It relies entirely on its host for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of other plants such as fir trees. The plant has a simple structure with no true roots, stems, or leaves, and instead possesses a root-like structure called a haustorium that attaches to the host. It is found in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions of the western United States. Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a minor but ecologically interesting role in forest ecosystems."
