    "intro": "Agrostis chathamica, commonly known as Chatham grass, is a small perennial grass native to the Chatham Islands of New Zealand. It typically grows in coastal and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet cluster, bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis chathamica plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems in its native range."
