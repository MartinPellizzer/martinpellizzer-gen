    "intro": "Arachnorchis viriosa, commonly known as the golden spider orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to Australia. It is characterized by its unique, spider-like floral structure, which features a prominent, hooded labellum and elongated, hairy petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its flowers, which range in color from yellow to orange, are pollinated primarily by thynnid wasps. Arachnorchis viriosa is a perennial herb that produces a single, showy flower per stem, making it a notable species in Australian flora."
