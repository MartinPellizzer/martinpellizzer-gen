    "intro": "Alkanna lehmannii, commonly known as Lehmann's alkanna, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of central and southern Africa. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and showy, pinkish to reddish flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are alternate and have a rough, hairy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Alkanna lehmannii is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to dry, sunny conditions."
