    "intro": "Aralia mandschurica, commonly known as the Manchurian aralia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds and mammals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Its botanical features make it a notable species in both horticulture and ecological studies."
