    "intro": "Atriplex elegans subsp. fasciculata, commonly known as coastal saltbush, is a shrub native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and gray-green foliage that is coated with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. This subspecies is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
