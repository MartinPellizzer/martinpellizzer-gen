    "intro": "Artemisia leucophylla var. pinnatifida, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features silvery-gray foliage with finely dissected, needle-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale blue to lavender flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its aromatic properties and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to arid landscapes."
