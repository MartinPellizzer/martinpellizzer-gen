    "intro": "Arenaria baicalensis, commonly known as the Baikal sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of Asia, particularly Mongolia and Siberia. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in alpine and arctic environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping to conserve moisture in harsh climates. Arenaria baicalensis is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
