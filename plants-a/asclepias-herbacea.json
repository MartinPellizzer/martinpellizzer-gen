    "intro": "Asclepias herbacea, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern and central United States. It features slender, hairy stems that often branch near the base, and its leaves are oval to lance-shaped with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with prominent orange spots, which attract various pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Its latex sap contains cardiac glycosides, making it toxic to some animals but essential for the survival of monarch butterflies. Asclepias herbacea plays a vital role in supporting biodiversity in its native habitats."
