    "intro": "Asclepias carsonii, commonly known as Carson's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to orange-red flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which deter herbivores. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, often with a fuzzy texture. Carson's milkweed is an important host plant for the endangered monarch butterfly, providing essential habitat for their larvae."
