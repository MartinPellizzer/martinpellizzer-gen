It features a compact, rhizomatous growth habit with heart-shaped, dark green, glossy leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, reddish-brown flowers that are typically borne on short, hairy stalks, which are concealed beneath the foliage. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
