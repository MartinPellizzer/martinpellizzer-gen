    "intro": "Aleuritopteris preslii, commonly known as the Japanese cliff brake, is a fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates. Aleuritopteris preslii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
