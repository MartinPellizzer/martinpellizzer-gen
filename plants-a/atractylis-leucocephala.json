It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are hairy and often have a strong, camphor-like scent. The showy white to yellow flower heads appear in late summer and are followed by spiky, bur-like seed structures."
