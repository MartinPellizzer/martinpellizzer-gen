It typically features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green coloration, and its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet that is often adorned with a bristle-like awn. This variety is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in other damp habitats. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological studies and ornamental gardening."
