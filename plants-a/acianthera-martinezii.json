    "intro": "Acianthera martinezii, commonly known as the Martinez's acianthera, is a species of orchid native to South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it attaches itself to trees without being parasitic. The flowers are usually pink or white, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators.",
