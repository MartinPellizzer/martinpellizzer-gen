    "intro": "Aralia elata f. fastigiata, commonly known as the upright aralia, is a compact, shrub-like plant with a distinctive upright growth habit. It features compound leaves that are narrow and elongated, giving it a unique, architectural appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It is native to eastern Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. This variety is more compact than the typical Aralia elata, making it suitable for smaller spaces."
