It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and produces showy, five-petaled yellow flowers. The plant has adapted to harsh environments with its succulent leaves and deep root system, allowing it to store water efficiently. Its flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
