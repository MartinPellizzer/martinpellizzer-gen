    "intro": "Adiantum fovearum, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble a lace-like pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in wetlands. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it in wet soil. Adiantum fovearum is known for its ability to tolerate periodic flooding, making it a common sight in riparian zones.",
