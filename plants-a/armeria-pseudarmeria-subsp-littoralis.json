    "intro": "Armeria pseudarmeria subsp. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a low-growing, flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It features dense clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy coastal habitats. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for coastal gardens and erosion control."
