    "intro": "Antimima condensa, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale blue flowers. The plant has silver-gray foliage with fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Antimima condensa is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
