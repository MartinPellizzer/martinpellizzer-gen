    "intro": "Armeriastrum senganense, commonly known as the Sengan's silverweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
