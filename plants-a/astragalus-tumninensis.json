It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize rocky and arid environments. Astragalus tumninensis is adapted to harsh climates, exhibiting deep root systems and drought tolerance, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
