    "intro": "Androsace henryi subsp. simulans, commonly known as the Alpine buttonweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It features a rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, arranged in clusters at the base of the leaf rosette. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
