It features heart-shaped leaves that are often trifoliate, with a distinctive waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but have a tart flavor. Akebia apetala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in traditional Chinese medicine. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a versatile plant for garden use."
