    "intro": "Ajuga orientalis, commonly known as carpet bugle or bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. Ajuga orientalis thrives in moist, shady environments and is often used in ground cover due to its spreading habit. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to suppress weeds in woodland gardens."
