    "intro": "Axyris prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate axyris, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to conserve water, typical of xerophytic plants. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody stems are often covered in a thick layer of bark, providing protection against drought and herbivory. Axyris prostrata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
