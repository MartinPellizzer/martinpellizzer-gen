    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 orellii, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium \u00d7 orellii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in indoor conditions."
