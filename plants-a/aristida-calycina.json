    "intro": "Aristida calycina, commonly known as the silky grass or slender false rice, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often covered in fine hairs. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is adapted to survive in low-nutrient, dry environments. Aristida calycina is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil."
