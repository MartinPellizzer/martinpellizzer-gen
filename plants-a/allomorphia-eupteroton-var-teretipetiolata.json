    "intro": "Allomorphia eupteroton var. teretipetiolata, commonly known as the narrow-petioled allomorph, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves with long, narrow petioles, which distinguish it from other varieties in the genus. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to grow in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
