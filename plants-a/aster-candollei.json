    "intro": "Aster candollei, commonly known as the Candolle's aster, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains in South America. It is characterized by its showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine regions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps it retain moisture. Aster candollei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climates."
