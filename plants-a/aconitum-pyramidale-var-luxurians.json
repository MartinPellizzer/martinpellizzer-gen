    "intro": "Aconitum pyramidale var. luxurians, commonly known as the Pyramidal Monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features striking, helmet-shaped blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has dark green, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive and ornamental appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its botanical name reflects its pyramid-like flower structure and its association with the genus Aconitum, which includes many toxic species.",
