    "intro": "Avicennia marina subsp. eucalyptifolia, commonly known as the mangrove with eucalyptus-like leaves, is a halophyte plant adapted to saline environments. It possesses specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which allow for gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant exhibits salt excretion through its leaves, a key adaptation to its coastal habitat. Its leaves are narrow and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. It plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and supporting biodiversity in intertidal zones."
