    "intro": "Amygdalus spinosissima, commonly known as the spiny almond, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, almond-like fruits that are typically edible but have a bitter taste. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
