    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies pattonii is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China, particularly in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Hubei. It thrives in high-altitude temperate forests, often found at elevations between 2,000 and 3,500 meters. This species is commonly associated with moist, well-drained soils and cooler climates. It is a valuable component of the local ecosystem, providing habitat for various wildlife species. However, its distribution is limited due to its specific environmental requirements.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies pattonii was mainly introduced to the data as a rare and ecologically significant conifer species. It is native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly in China. The introduction of Abies pattonii into the dataset highlights its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and potential ecological roles in forest ecosystems. Its inclusion provides valuable insights into biodiversity and conservation efforts in temperate regions."
