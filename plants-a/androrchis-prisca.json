    "intro": "Androrchis prisca, commonly known as the ancient orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the mountainous regions of central Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a short, stocky rhizome and produces small, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
