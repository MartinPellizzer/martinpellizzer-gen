    "intro": "Argyrophanes, commonly known as silverleaf nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. These plants are characterized by their silver-gray foliage, which gives them their common name, and their small, often showy flowers. They are native to various regions in the Americas and are typically found in dry, rocky habitats. Argyrophanes species are perennial herbs that can grow as shrubs or subshrubs, with some species reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The genus includes several species, such as Argyrophanes corymbosa, which is known for its edible berries, though they are generally not consumed by humans."
