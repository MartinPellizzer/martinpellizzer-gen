    "intro": "Amelanchier sanguinea var. alnifolia, commonly known as the red elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and often have a reddish hue during the growing season. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible when fully ripe but contain toxic seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks."
