    "intro": "Alansmia esquiveliana, commonly known as the Mexican ghostflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It belongs to the evening primrose family (Onagraceae) and is characterized by its delicate, pale yellow flowers that open at dusk. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Alansmia esquiveliana is considered a vulnerable species."
