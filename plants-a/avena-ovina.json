    "intro": "Avena ovina, commonly known as sheep's barley, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces edible grains that are used in animal feed. Avena ovina thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and agricultural applications."
