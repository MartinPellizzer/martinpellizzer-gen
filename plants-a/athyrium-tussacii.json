    "intro": "Athyrium tussacii, commonly known as the Tussac fern, is a species of fern native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender fronds that can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and contribute to the formation of dense, tussock-like growths. The fronds are typically bioluminescent under certain conditions, adding to its unique ecological role."
