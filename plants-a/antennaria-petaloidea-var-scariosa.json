    "intro": "Antennaria petaloidea var. scariosa, commonly known as the silky mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often appearing before the leaves fully develop. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with dense, woolly foliage that helps retain moisture and insulate against cold temperatures. Its leaves are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, giving the plant a soft, fuzzy appearance. This variety is characterized by its distinctive scaly, papery bracts that surround the flowers, adding to its ornamental appeal."
