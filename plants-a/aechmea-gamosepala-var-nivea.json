    "intro": "Aechmea gamosepala var. nivea, commonly known as the white-tipped bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces showy inflorescences with colorful bracts, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which attract pollinators. Its leaves are typically long, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of fine trichomes, aiding in water retention. The variety 'nivea' is distinguished by its pale or white-tipped foliage, adding to its ornamental appeal."
