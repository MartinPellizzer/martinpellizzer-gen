    "intro": "Alsophila walkerae, commonly known as the Walkera's tree fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical rainforests. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting its upright growth. The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
