    "intro": "Anthurium supraglandulum, commonly known as the velvet leaf anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces striking spadices, which are the modified leaves that enclose the true flowers. Its growth habit is typically epiphytic, meaning it often grows on the surfaces of trees in its natural habitat. Anthurium supraglandulum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant."
