    "intro": "Adiantum lancea, commonly known as the lanceleaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Adiantaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are finely divided and often have a silvery underside. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous small, upright sporangia on the undersides of the fronds. Adiantum lancea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings.",
