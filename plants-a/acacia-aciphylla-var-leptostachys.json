    "intro": "Acacia aciphylla var. leptostachys, commonly known as the slender-stemmed wattle, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, woody stems and small, bipinnate leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late winter to early spring, attracting a variety of pollinators. It has adapted to survive in poor soils and is often found in coastal and inland dunes. Due to its resilience, it is used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soils and prevent erosion.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia aciphylla var. leptostachys is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. This variety thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in shrubland and grassland ecosystems. It is well adapted to withstand drought conditions and high temperatures. The plant is often seen growing in coastal areas and inland deserts. Its distribution is closely linked to the availability of well-drained soils and minimal rainfall.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia aciphylla var. leptostachys was mainly introduced to regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and open woodlands. This plant is commonly used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and attractive foliage. It is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded areas. However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native environments."
