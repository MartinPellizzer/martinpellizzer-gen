    "intro": "Aspidium aculeatum subsp. moritzianum, commonly known as the Moritz's water fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in water gardens or as a decorative plant in humid environments."
