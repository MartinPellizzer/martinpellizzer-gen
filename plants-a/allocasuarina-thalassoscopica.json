    "intro": "Allocasuarina thalassoscopica, commonly known as the coastal she-oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive feathery, needle-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid or saline environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in spikes, which are followed by woody, cone-like structures containing seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes and heathlands. Allocasuarina thalassoscopica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
