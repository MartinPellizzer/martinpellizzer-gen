    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies alba var. glauca was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often in regions where it has been cultivated for ornamental purposes. It is commonly found in parks, gardens, and landscaped areas in Europe and parts of North America. This variety is valued for its unique bluish-gray foliage and pyramidal shape, making it a popular choice for horticultural use. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires moderate moisture levels. However, it is not typically found in its native habitat outside of its introduced range."
