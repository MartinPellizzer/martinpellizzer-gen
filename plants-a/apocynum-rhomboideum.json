    "intro": "Apocynum rhomboideum, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies."
