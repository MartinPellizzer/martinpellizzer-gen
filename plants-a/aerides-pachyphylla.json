    "intro": "Aerides pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leafed orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its humid, tropical habitat. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in greenhouses and as a houseplant."
