    "intro": "Anthurium ramosense, commonly known as the red anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped spathe that ranges from deep red to orange in color. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white spathes that enclose the true flowers, which are typically hidden within. Anthurium ramosense thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. It is valued in horticulture for its striking appearance and ability to purify indoor air."
