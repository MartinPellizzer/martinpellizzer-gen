    "intro": "Athyrium parvum, commonly known as the small fern or dwarf lady fern, is a delicate perennial plant native to eastern North America. It features finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while supporting its growth. Athyrium parvum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in garden landscapes for its elegant, soft appearance."
