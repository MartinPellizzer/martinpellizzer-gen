    "intro": "Arenaria serpyllifolia subsp. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and sandy soils in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender stems. Its leaves are usually broader and more elongated compared to other subspecies of *Arenaria serpyllifolia*. The subspecies is adapted to harsh environments, making it a hardy and resilient plant in arid or coastal regions."
