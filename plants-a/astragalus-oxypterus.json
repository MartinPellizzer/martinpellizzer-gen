    "intro": "Astragalus oxypterus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus oxypterus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
