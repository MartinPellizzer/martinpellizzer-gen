    "intro": "Aulacophyllum ortgiesii, commonly known as the narrow-leafed liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its simple, lobed leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette or overlapping pattern. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or on the forest floor. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, produce spores that are dispersed by wind. Aulacophyllum ortgiesii plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
