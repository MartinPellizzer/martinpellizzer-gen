    "intro": "Anemone oregana, commonly known as the Pacific anemone or Oregon anemone, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant features showy white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive lobed shape that helps distinguish it from other anemone species. Anemone oregana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
