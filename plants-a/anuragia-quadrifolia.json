    "intro": "Anuragia quadrifolia, commonly known as the four-leaf clover, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that often have four leaflets, a rare and symbolic trait. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its rarity and symbolic significance, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
