It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems and small, spiny leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
