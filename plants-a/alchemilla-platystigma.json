    "intro": "Alchemilla platystigma, commonly known as the broad-stemmed lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender, branching stems. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties. Alchemilla platystigma thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade."
