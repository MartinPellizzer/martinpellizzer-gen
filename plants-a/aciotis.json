    "intro": "Aciotis, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are native to various regions of the Americas and are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and inconspicuous yellow flowers. Aciotis species typically grow in moist, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. They have a taproot system and produce seeds that are dispersed by wind. Some species are considered invasive in certain areas due to their rapid growth and ability to colonize new environments."
