    "intro": "Arytera collina, commonly known as the mountain daisy, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky soils, thriving in cooler climates. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Arytera collina is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
