    "intro": "Aspidium gymnocarpum, commonly known as the naked-seed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Water fern family (Hydropteraceae). It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnate fronds that are typically bright green and covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Asia and Africa, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures are unique, with the sporangia being naked and clustered on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium gymnocarpum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms in its natural habitat."
