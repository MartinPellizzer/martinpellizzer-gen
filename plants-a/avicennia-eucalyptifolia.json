    "intro": "Avicennia eucalyptifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mangrove, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It possesses specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant exhibits succulent leaves that help reduce water loss in high-salinity conditions. It is typically found in coastal areas, such as estuaries and tidal flats, across the Indo-Pacific region. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
