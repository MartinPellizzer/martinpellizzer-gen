    "intro": "Arenaria arenarioides var. oranensis, commonly known as the Oran sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa. It features small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an attractive choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
