    "intro": "Astragalus brevitomentosus, commonly known as the short-hairs milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, hairy stipules and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is part of the Fabaceae family, known for nitrogen fixation. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in certain areas."
