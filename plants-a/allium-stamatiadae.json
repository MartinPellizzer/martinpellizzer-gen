    "intro": "Allium stamatiadae, commonly known as the Stamatiada's onion, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Cyprus. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family, which includes a variety of bulbous plants. The plant features a solitary, slender bulb and produces a single, upright stem with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale purple, arranged in a loose umbel, and bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
