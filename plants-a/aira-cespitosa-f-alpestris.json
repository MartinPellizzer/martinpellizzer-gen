    "intro": "Aira cespitosa f. alpestris, commonly known as alpine grass or alpine air grass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish spikelets that are often clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in alpine ecosystems."
