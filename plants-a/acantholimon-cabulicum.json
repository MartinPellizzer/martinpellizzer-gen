    "intro": "Acantholimon cabulicum, commonly known as the Kabul thornsteppe, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Plumbaginaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, succulent-like stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically produces blue or purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in dry conditions. Acantholimon cabulicum is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is a hardy species that thrives in high-altitude regions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon cabulicum is primarily native to Afghanistan. It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the Hindu Kush and surrounding areas. This plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, often at higher elevations. It is well adapted to the harsh climate and limited soil conditions of its native habitat. Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in Afghanistan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon cabulicum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and sunny to partially shaded conditions. It thrives in regions with moderate temperatures and low to moderate precipitation. This plant is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens. Its introduction has been noted in several regions of the western United States and parts of California. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
