    "intro": "Athyrium quelpartense, commonly known as the Quelpart holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine in its native regions. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
