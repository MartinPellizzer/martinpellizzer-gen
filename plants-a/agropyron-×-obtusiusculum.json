    "intro": "Agropyron \u00d7 obtusiusculum, commonly known as the intermediate wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Great Plains of North America. It is a hybrid between Agropyron cristatum (crested wheatgrass) and Agropyron dasystachyum (needlegrass), exhibiting traits from both parents. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, narrow leaves, and dense, tufted inflorescences. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it valuable for erosion control and forage production. Its ability to thrive in poor soils also makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
