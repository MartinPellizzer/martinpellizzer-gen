It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes eucalyptus and other aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a humid, subtropical climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
