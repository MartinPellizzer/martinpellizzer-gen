    "intro": "Alisma bolivianum, commonly known as the Bolivian water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating. Its flowering stems bear small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Alisma bolivianum is adapted to aquatic conditions, with specialized structures that help it float and absorb nutrients from water."
