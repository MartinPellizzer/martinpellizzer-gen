    "intro": "Agave univittata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved agave, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The leaves are lined with sharp spines and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces a tall flowering stalk that bears small, white flowers, which attract pollinators like bees and bats. This plant is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established."
