    "intro": "Altingia cambodiana, commonly known as the Cambodian altingia, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Cambodia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
