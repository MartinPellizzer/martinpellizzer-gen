    "intro": "Astragalus macroptilus var. lycaonicum, commonly known as the Lycaon milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species in xerophytic environments. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers. This variety is often found in rocky habitats and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators."
