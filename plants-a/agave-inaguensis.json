    "intro": "Agave inaguensis, commonly known as the Inagua agave, is a species native to the island of Inagua in the Bahamas. It is a succulent plant characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears small, white flowers, which are followed by the development of its characteristic blue-gray berries. Agave inaguensis is adapted to arid and coastal environments, making it resilient to drought and salt spray. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
