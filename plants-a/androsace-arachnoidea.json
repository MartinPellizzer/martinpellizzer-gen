    "intro": "Androsace arachnoidea, commonly known as the spider's web rockrose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, showy flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, woolly layer of trichomes, which help to reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. Androsace arachnoidea is well adapted to rocky and gravelly soils, thriving in cool, moist environments."
