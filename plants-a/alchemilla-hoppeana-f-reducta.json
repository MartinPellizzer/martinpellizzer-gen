    "intro": "Alchemilla hoppeana f. reducta, commonly known as the compact alchemilla, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in suitable climates."
