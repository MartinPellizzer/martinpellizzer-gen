    "intro": "Angraecum finetianum, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its long, slender petals and a distinctive, star-shaped appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. It produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a conservation concern."
