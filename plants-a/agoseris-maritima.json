    "intro": "Agoseris maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its blue to purple composite flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion. It is often found in dunes and along shorelines, where it plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems. Agoseris maritima is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
