    "intro": "Alchemilla niltarensis, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, silver-gray leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are typically borne on slender, leafless stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forest edges. Alchemilla niltarensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
