    "intro": "Armeria maritima var. labradorica, commonly known as the Labrador sea thrift, is a perennial flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Labrador and parts of Newfoundland. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. Its basal leaves are linear and grass-like, while the stems are erect and bear the showy inflorescences. This variety is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
