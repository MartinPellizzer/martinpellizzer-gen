    "intro": "Astragalus serotinus var. palliseri, commonly known as the Palliser's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its hairy stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility. Its seeds are typically dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize open areas effectively."
