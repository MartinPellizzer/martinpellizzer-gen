    "intro": "Artemisia androsacea, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silvery-green leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant contains volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its strong scent and medicinal properties. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or open habitats. Artemisia androsacea has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its antiparasitic and digestive benefits."
