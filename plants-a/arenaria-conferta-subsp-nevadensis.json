    "intro": "Arenaria conferta subsp. nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It typically thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are generally narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous regions of Nevada and adjacent states."
