    "intro": "Apera tenuiflora, commonly known as slender oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, dunes, and roadside areas. The plant has thin, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture. Apera tenuiflora is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small invertebrates."
