    "intro": "Astragalus suffalcatus, commonly known as the alpine milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh, arid environments. Astragalus suffalcatus is adapted to high altitudes and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils."
