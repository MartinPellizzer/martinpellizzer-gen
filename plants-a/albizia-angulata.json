It is characterized by its compound leaves that are pinnately arranged and have a slender, angular appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often used in ornamental horticulture. Albizia angulata is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing abilities, making it useful in soil enrichment."
