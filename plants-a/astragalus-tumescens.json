It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Astragalus tumescens plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
