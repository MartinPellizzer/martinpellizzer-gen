    "intro": "Agonis juniperina, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mallee, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, needle-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant produces blue-black berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, Mediterranean climates. Agonis juniperina is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
