    "intro": "Agrostis signata var. flavida, commonly known as the yellow meadowgrass, is a grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, bluish-green leaves that turn golden-yellow in the autumn. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale yellow to brownish flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
