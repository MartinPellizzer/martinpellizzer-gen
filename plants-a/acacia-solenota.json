    "intro": "Acacia solenota, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and bipinnate leaves composed of small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Acacia solenota is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing drought tolerance through its deep root system. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils.",

This plant thrives in open woodlands and savanna-like habitats. It is well adapted to the warm and often dry climate of Queensland. Acacia solenota plays an important ecological role in its native environment.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia solenota was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its deep root system and ability to fix nitrogen. Its introduction has sometimes led to competition with native species in invaded habitats. Acacia solenota is also valued for its hardy nature and potential for use in reforestation projects."
