    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 eglii, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce dense colonies, making it an effective ground cover in suitable conditions. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
