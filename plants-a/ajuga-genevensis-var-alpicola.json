It belongs to the Valerianaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils. Ajuga genevensis var. alpicola is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
