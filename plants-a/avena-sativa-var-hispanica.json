    "intro": "Avena sativa var. hispanica, commonly known as Spanish oats, is a variant of the oat species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. Its seeds are often used in traditional culinary and medicinal practices. Botanically, it is distinguished by its morphological features and genetic variation from the more common Avena sativa."
