It is characterized by its hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",
