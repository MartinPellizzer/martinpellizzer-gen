    "intro": "Aiphanes hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy papyrus, is a species of palm native to the Caribbean, particularly found in parts of Cuba and the Bahamas. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its inflorescences are clustered and bear small, white flowers that develop into clustered, berry-like fruits. Aiphanes hirsuta plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
