    "intro": "Arnebia sewerzowii, commonly known as the Kashmir stone root, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
