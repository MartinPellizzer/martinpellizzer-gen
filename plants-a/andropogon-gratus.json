    "intro": "Andropogon gratus, commonly known as silky grass or silky panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fine, silky-textured leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense spikelets, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Andropogon gratus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
