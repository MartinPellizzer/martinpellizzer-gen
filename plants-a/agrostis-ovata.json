    "intro": "Agrostis ovata, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, spreading stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually slightly hairy. Its small, spikelet-based inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Agrostis ovata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in turfgrass mixtures."
