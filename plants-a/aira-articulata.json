    "intro": "Aira articulata, commonly known as the slender false wheat, is a grass-like plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist soils along stream banks, wet meadows, and marshy areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread across wetland habitats. While not commonly cultivated, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
