    "intro": "Arctostaphylos ledifolia, commonly known as manzanita, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its reddish bark, evergreen foliage, and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible for wildlife but generally unpalatable to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Arctostaphylos ledifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity."
