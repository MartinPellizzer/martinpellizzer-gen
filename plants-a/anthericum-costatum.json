    "intro": "Anthericum costatum, commonly known as the zigzag plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features a distinctive zigzagging stem that gives it its common name, and it produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, acidic soils. Anthericum costatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in wetland environments."
