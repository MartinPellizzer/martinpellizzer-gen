    "intro": "Agrostis ligulata, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats on moist soils, often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive colonies. Agrostis ligulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
