    "intro": "Achillea \u00d7 serrata, commonly known as the hybrid yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its feathery, finely divided leaves and flat-topped clusters of small, often white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine. Its hybrid nature results from crosses between Achillea millefolium and Achillea ptarmica.",
