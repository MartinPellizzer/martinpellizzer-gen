    "intro": "Avena sicula, commonly known as Sicilian oat, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are wind-pollinated. Avena sicula is often found in open habitats such as cliffs, slopes, and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and traditional uses in local communities."
