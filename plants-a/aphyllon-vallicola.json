    "intro": "Aphyllon vallicola, commonly known as the valley lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is a foliose lichen, characterized by its leaf-like thallus structure, which is typically greenish to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or tree trunks in temperate regions. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for ecosystem health."
