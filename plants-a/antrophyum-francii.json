    "intro": "Antrophyum francii, commonly known as the African cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is a slow-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of stiff, feather-like leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Antrophyum francii is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List."
