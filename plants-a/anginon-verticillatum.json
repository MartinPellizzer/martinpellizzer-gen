    "intro": "Anginon verticillatum, commonly known as the spiral herb, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of leaves around the stem, a feature that gives it its scientific name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
