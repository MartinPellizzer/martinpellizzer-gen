    "intro": "Ardisia fordii, commonly known as the Chinese evergreen or Ford's ardisia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myaceae. It is native to southern China and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Ardisia fordii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to tolerate partial shade."
