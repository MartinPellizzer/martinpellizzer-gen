    "intro": "Arrhenatherum namaquense, commonly known as the Namqua grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous minute flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in arid regions."
