    "intro": "Amitostigma wenshanense, commonly known as the Wenshan lily, is a rare alpine plant native to China. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a rosette structure to conserve moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
