It is a natural hybrid between Achillea millefolium (common yarrow) and Achillea ptarmica (sneezeweed), resulting in a plant with distinctive, feathery foliage. The plant produces small, composite flower heads that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Achillea \u00d7 valesiaca is often found in meadows and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine.",
