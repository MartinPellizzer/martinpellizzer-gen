    "intro": "Atriplex hastata, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. The plant has small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it well adapted to saline soils and coastal areas. Atriplex hastata plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
