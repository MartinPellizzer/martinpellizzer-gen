It is a grass species characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and awned lemmas. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to temperate climates. Its genetic diversity makes it an important resource for wheat improvement programs. It is also valued for its potential in forage and as a source of novel genes for crop resilience."
