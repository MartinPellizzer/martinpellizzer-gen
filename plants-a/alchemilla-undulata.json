    "intro": "Alchemilla undulata, commonly known as Lady\u2019s Mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla undulata is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported healing properties."
