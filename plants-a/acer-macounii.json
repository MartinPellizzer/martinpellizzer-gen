    "intro": "Acer macounii, commonly known as the Macoun maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Appalachian Mountains of the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming more fissured with age. Acer macounii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its showy foliage.",
