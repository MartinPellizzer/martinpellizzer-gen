    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia elongata var. typica is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is commonly found in savannas and shrublands. This species is well adapted to drought conditions and can survive in areas with low rainfall. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. Its distribution is largely restricted to the southern parts of the African continent.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia elongata var. typica was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in various soil conditions. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest margins. However, it is considered a potential weed in some parts of its introduced range."
