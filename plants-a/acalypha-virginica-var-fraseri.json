    "intro": "Acalypha virginica var. fraseri, commonly known as Fraser's beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of small, violet-blue berries that appear in late summer and persist into winter. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and a reddish underside. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha virginica var. fraseri is primarily native to the southeastern United States, including parts of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and Alabama. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This variety is commonly found in lowland areas with rich, organic soils. It is often associated with wetland ecosystems and is sometimes considered a wetland indicator species. Due to its preference for specific environmental conditions, its distribution is relatively limited compared to other varieties of Acalypha virginica.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha virginica var. fraseri was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in states like Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. It has been established in wetland areas and along the edges of water bodies where it thrives in moist, sunny conditions. This plant is often found in disturbed sites such as ditches, marshes, and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes contribute to its success in these environments. However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions due to its competitive nature."
