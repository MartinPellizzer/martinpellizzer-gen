It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is commonly seen in dry forests and along rocky shores. Abutilon menziesii is an important part of Hawaii's native flora and is often used in traditional Hawaiian practices. Its distribution is limited to the islands of Hawaii, making it a unique and endemic species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon menziesii was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers and fuzzy leaves. The plant thrives in coastal and riparian habitats, often growing along streams and in moist soils. It has become naturalized in some areas, sometimes competing with native vegetation. Despite its beauty, it is considered an invasive species in certain regions where it spreads aggressively."
