    "intro": "Agrimonia eupatoria var. pilosa, commonly known as rough agrimony, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by reddish-brown, cone-like seed heads. Its leaves are oval to lance-shaped with serrated edges and are covered in fine pubescence. This species is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its astringent properties."
