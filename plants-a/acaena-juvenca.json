    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena juvenca is primarily native to New Zealand North. It is found in the northern regions of New Zealand, including the North Island and parts of the South Island. This plant typically grows in coastal areas and lowland habitats. It is commonly associated with sandy or gravelly soils in these regions. Acaena juvenca is part of the native flora that contributes to the ecological diversity of New Zealand's northern ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena juvenca was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. The plant has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. However, it is not considered invasive and has limited ecological impact."
