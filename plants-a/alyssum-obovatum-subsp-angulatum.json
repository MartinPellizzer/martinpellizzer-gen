    "intro": "Alyssum obovatum subsp. angulatum, commonly known as the angular alyssum, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The leaves are typically narrow and slightly serrated, and the plant produces small, angular seed pods. Native to southern Europe, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early spring bloom and ability to attract pollinators."
