    "intro": "Aspidium falcatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds that exhibit a unique spiral arrangement. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as stream banks and forest floors. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous spore-bearing structures called sorus. Aspidium falcatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in water gardens and bog gardens."
