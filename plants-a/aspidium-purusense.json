    "intro": "Aspidium purusense, commonly known as the Brazilian water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green in color. This plant is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Aspidium purusense has rhizomes that spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies in wetlands and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of its fronds and produce spores for propagation."
