    "intro": "Aspalathus odontoloba, commonly known as the rooibos bush, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color. The plant produces small, round, reddish-brown seeds that are harvested for their use in herbal tea. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a Mediterranean climate with mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers. Aspalathus odontoloba is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
