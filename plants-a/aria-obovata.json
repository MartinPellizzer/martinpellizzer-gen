    "intro": "Aria obovata, commonly known as the broad-ovate arrowhead, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its arrowhead-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in an inflorescence called a spadix, which is enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. Aria obovata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
