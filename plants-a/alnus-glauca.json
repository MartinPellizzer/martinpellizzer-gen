    "intro": "Alnus glauca, commonly known as the white alder, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins that are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Alnus glauca has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, making it valuable for soil enrichment."
