    "intro": "Anogramma caespitosa, commonly known as the clustered maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, with numerous small, lance-shaped fronds that are often curled when young. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in small, round structures called sorangia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. The fronds are delicate and have a distinctive, feathery appearance, typical of the Dryopteris genus."
