    "intro": "Ampelocissus sinuosa, commonly known as the sinuous cat's claw, is a climbing vine native to southern Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves with a waxy texture and dark green coloration. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Ampelocissus sinuosa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
