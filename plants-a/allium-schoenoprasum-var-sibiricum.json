    "intro": "Allium schoenoprasum var. sibiricum, commonly known as Siberian chives, is a perennial herb native to the colder regions of Siberia and northern Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color and emit a mild garlic scent when crushed. The plant produces small, clustered white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are followed by bulbils that can be used for propagation. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. This variety is valued for its culinary use and ornamental appeal in cold climates."
