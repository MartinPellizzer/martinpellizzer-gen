    "intro": "Artanthe concinna, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in desert and rocky habitats. Artanthe concinna is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
