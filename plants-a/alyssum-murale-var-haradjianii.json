    "intro": "Alyssum murale var. haradjianii, commonly known as the Haradjian's wallflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features low-growing, mat-forming stems with dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, and pink. The plant has narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from spring to early autumn."
