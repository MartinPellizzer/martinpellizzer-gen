    "intro": "Artemisia subintegra, commonly known as silky wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its finely hairy, silvery-green foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its aromatic leaves and medicinal properties have made it a subject of interest in traditional herbal medicine."
