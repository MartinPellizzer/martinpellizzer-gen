    "intro": "Atriplex purpurea, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant has a branched stem system, often growing in dense clusters to maximize sunlight absorption. Its flowers are small and greenish-yellow, typically clustered in inflorescences. Atriplex purpurea is well adapted to saline soils and is often found in desert landscapes and coastal areas."
