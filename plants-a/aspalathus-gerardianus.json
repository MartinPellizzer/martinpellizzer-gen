    "intro": "Aspalathus gerardianus, commonly known as the sweet thorn, is a small, deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing drought-resistant features. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. However, it is not as commercially significant as its relative, Aspalathus linearis, which is used in the production of rooibos tea."
