It is characterized by its distinctive, often showy flower heads that resemble a star or a crown, giving it its common name. The plant typically features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Asterocephalus species are native to various regions in Africa and are often found in arid or semi-arid environments. These plants are adapted to withstand drought conditions and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
