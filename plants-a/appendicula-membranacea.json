    "intro": "Appendicula membranacea, commonly known as the membranous appendicula, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family, which includes many species with showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant is characterized by its delicate, heart-shaped leaves and small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
