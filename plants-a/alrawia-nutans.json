    "intro": "Alrawia nutans, commonly known as the hanging sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate habit and fleshy, succulent stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous green flowers that are often hidden among the foliage. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Alrawia nutans is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
