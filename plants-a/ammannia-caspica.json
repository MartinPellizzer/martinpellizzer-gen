    "intro": "Ammannia caspica, commonly known as the Caspian ammannia, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to harsh, desert-like environments. Ammannia caspica is often found in saline lakes and marshes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
