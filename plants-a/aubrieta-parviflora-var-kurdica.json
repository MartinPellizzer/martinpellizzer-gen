    "intro": "Aubrieta parviflora var. kurdica, commonly known as the Kurdish rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East. It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has compact, mat-forming foliage with dark green, lobed leaves that are adapted to rocky and well-drained soils. It is well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings due to its hardiness and drought tolerance. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological value in natural habitats."
