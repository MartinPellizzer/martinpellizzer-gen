    "intro": "Aspidium prolificum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically bright green and slightly glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams, marshes, or in humid forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Aspidium prolificum plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
