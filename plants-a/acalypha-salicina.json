This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. It is often associated with humid tropical and subtropical climates. Its native distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Peru.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha salicina was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of cultivation. It has since become naturalized in various regions, particularly in coastal and riparian areas. The plant spreads through both seed dispersal and vegetative propagation, contributing to its rapid establishment in new environments. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in certain ecosystems. Its distribution highlights the ecological impacts of introducing non-native plants to new habitats."
