    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acarna casabonae is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It thrives in coastal areas and rocky soils, often found in regions with mild, temperate climates. This plant is commonly associated with the island of Corsica, where it has been historically documented in its natural habitat. It is also present in parts of Italy, Greece, and the Balearic Islands. Due to its specific environmental requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acarna casabonae was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive, showy flowers. It is commonly found in gardens and landscapes in regions with warm climates. The plant is native to South America but has been widely cultivated outside its native range. Its introduction has led to its presence in various parts of the world, including the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. However, it is not considered invasive in most areas where it is grown."
