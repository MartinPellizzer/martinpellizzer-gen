    "intro": "Agave obducta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved agave, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a succulent plant characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The leaves are narrow and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. This plant is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
