    "intro": "Astrocaryum cuatrecasasianum, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas palm, is a species of palm native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible fruits that are encased in a spiny, fibrous husk. Its seeds are encased in a hard, woody endocarp, which is a distinctive botanical feature. This palm is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in traditional practices by local communities."
