    "intro": "Arenaria mairei, commonly known as the Maire's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of New Zealand. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pink flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine environments. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. Arenaria mairei plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
