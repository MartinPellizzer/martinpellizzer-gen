    "intro": "Acer nudicarpum, commonly known as the naked-seed maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by unique, winged fruits that are often retained on the branches throughout the winter. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Acer nudicarpum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its seasonal color changes.",
