It features a distinctive, spiral-arranged inflorescence with a spadix enclosed by a pale green spathe. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often variegated with yellow or white markings. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female parts, and it relies on insects for pollination. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
