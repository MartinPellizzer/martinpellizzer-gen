    "intro": "Andropogon goeringii, commonly known as inland needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern and central United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its root system is rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands. Andropogon goeringii is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing soil."
