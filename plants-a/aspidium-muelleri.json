    "intro": "Aspidium muelleri, commonly known as the Mueller's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Aspidium muelleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
