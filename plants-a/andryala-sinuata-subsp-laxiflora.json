It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators like bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance.
