    "intro": "Asplenium carvalhoanum, commonly known as the Carvalhoanum spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth habit with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a distinctive pattern. Asplenium carvalhoanum is notable for its ecological adaptability and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
