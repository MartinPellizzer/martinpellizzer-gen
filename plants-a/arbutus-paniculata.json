    "intro": "Arbutus paniculata, commonly known as the California madrone, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by edible red berries in the fall. Its leaves are broad, elliptical, and have a leathery texture with a distinctive waxy coating. Arbutus paniculata thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and mountainous regions."
