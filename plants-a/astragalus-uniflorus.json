    "intro": "Astragalus uniflorus, commonly known as the single-flower milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, leathery pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands and rocky habitats. Astragalus uniflorus plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment."
