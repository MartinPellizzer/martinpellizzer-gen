    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera var. viridula, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and dense, creeping growth habit, which forms a dense mat on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil make it a popular choice for landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
