    "intro": "Arachis hermannii, commonly known as the wild peanut, is a species of legume native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, well-drained soils. Arachis hermannii is closely related to the cultivated peanut (Arachis hypogaea) and is studied for its genetic diversity and potential agricultural applications."
