It features delicate, feathery plumes of white to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that provide a striking contrast to its floral display. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often used in woodland gardens. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking shade-tolerant plants."
