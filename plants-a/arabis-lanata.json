    "intro": "Arabis lanata, commonly known as the woolly rockcress, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. Arabis lanata thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or coastal environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
