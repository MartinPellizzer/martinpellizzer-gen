    "intro": "Anil zollingeriana, commonly known as the Zollinger's anil, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces yellowish-white blooms that are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal or rocky garden environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
