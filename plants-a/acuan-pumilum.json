    "intro": "Acuan pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf acuan, is a small, herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, featuring delicate, lance-shaped leaves arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a common sight in tropical rainforests. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.",
