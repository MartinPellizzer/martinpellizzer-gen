    "intro": "Alchemilla omalophylla, commonly known as the yellow lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of soft, hairy, evergreen leaves that form a dense, cushion-like structure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Alchemilla omalophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to retain its foliage year-round."
