    "intro": "Aulomyrcia thyrsiflora var. lateriflora, commonly known as the lateriflora variant of the thyrso-flowered aulomyrcia, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The flowers are typically arranged in terminal or axillary thyrses, with some lateral flowers emerging from the leaf axils, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, elliptical berries that are edible and have a mild, slightly acidic flavor. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded to semi-shaded environments."
