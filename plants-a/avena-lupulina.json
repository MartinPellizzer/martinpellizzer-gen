    "intro": "Avena lupulina, commonly known as the \"hops oat,\" is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce both male and female flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically hairy, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it is often found growing in meadows and along stream banks. Avena lupulina is closely related to the cultivated hop plant, Humulus lupulus, and shares some similar ecological and botanical traits."
