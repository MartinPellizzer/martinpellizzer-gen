    "intro": "Asperula nitida, commonly known as silverbells, is a deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, appearing in clusters during late spring. The plant has finely toothed, ovate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Asperula nitida is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
