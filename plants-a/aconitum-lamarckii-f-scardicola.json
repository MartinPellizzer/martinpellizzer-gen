    "intro": "Aconitum lamarckii f. scardicola, commonly known as the Scardicola hybrid, is a rare and striking member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in clusters at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately compound, with finely divided lobes that give it a delicate appearance. This ferny-leaved perennial is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland edges and stream banks.",
