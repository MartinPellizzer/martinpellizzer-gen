    "intro": "Alchemilla pentaphyllea subvar. heptaphylla, commonly known as the seven-leaf lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves that are covered in dense, silky white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in summer, arranged in clusters at the ends of leafless stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
