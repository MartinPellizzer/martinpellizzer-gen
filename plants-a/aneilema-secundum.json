    "intro": "Aneilema secundum, commonly known as the African violet, is a tropical perennial herb native to eastern Africa. It features upright stems with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy and have a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aneilema secundum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
