    "intro": "Alyssum vardarense, commonly known as the alpine alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its foliage is covered in fine, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Alyssum vardarense is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
