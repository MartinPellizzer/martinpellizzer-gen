    "intro": "Asplenium semipinnatum, commonly known as the fan-leaf spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or along streams. Its leaves are often recurved, with a distinct central vein and small, scale-like structures along the margins. Asplenium semipinnatum is a perennial plant that reproduces through spores, commonly found in temperate regions across the Northern Hemisphere."
