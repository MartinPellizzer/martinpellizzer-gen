    "intro": "Athyrium henryi var. viridifrons, commonly known as the green-fronded lady fern, is a fern species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking shade-tolerant plants."
