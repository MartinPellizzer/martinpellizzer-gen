    "intro": "Aegilops comosa var. biaristata, commonly known as the hairy wild wheat, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces spikelets with awns, which are bristle-like structures that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or marginal habitats. Due to its genetic similarity to wheat, it is of interest in agricultural research for potential use in crop improvement."
