    "intro": "Ajuga chamaecistus subsp. scoparia, commonly known as creeping bugloss, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers in early spring, which are clustered in spikes along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread and form a lush, carpet-like ground cover."
