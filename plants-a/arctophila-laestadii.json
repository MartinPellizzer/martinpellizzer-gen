    "intro": "Arctophila laestadii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with small, narrow leaves adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Arctophila laestadii is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
