    "intro": "Amsonia elliptica, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, bluish-green leaves and its striking, cloud-like blue-gray flower clusters that appear in late spring to early summer. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardens and natural landscapes. Its foliage turns a vibrant gold in the fall, adding seasonal interest. Amsonia elliptica is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
