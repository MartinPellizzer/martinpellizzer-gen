    "intro": "Astragalus atlanticus, commonly known as the Atlantic milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the shoreline. Astragalus atlanticus plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
