    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer campestre var. pendulum-foliis-variegatis is primarily native to parts of Europe, particularly in the British Isles and southern Scandinavia. This variety of the common horse chestnut is known for its distinctive variegated leaves and weeping growth habit. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. The plant is commonly found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and along riverbanks. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens across much of Europe.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer campestre var. pendulum-foliis-variegatis was mainly introduced to the United States and Canada in the early 20th century as an ornamental plant. It was favored for its unique variegated leaves and weeping growth habit, which made it a popular choice for garden landscapes. The introduction was primarily through horticultural trade and the efforts of botanical gardens and nurseries. It has since been cultivated in various regions with temperate climates. However, its spread outside of cultivated areas is limited due to its specific growing requirements."
