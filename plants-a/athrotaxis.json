    "intro": "Athrotaxis, commonly known as the mountain ash or blackwood, is a genus of evergreen shrubs or small trees native to Australia. It belongs to the family Podocarpaceae and is characterized by its conifer-like appearance with needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody cones that contain seeds. Athrotaxis species are typically found in cool, moist environments such as mountainous regions and are often associated with heathland ecosystems. These plants play an important role in their native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
