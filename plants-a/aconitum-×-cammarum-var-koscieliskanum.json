    "intro": "Aconitum \u00d7 cammarum var. koscieliskanum, commonly known as the Koscieliskanum variety of the hybrid Aconitum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, adorned with palmate, deeply lobed leaves. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense, spires that attract pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a desirable ornamental in gardens. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets.",
