    "intro": "Amorphophallus cobra, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features broad, waxy leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still water. The plant's most notable characteristic is its large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, emitting a strong odor resembling rotting flesh. Its rhizome system allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a valuable ornamental plant and a potential invasive species. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires shallow, nutrient-rich water for optimal growth."
