    "intro": "Astragalus wilhelmsii, commonly known as the Wilhelms' milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its seeds are small and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across its native range."
