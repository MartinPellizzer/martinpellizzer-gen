    "intro": "Arnica mollis var. petiolaris, commonly known as the Alpine tawnpuff, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, basal rosette of leaves and its tall, branched stem that bears yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. Its flowers are tubular and clustered in a cylindrical shape, which is typical of the tribe Cardueae. The leaves are elongated with a petiole, giving the variety its specific name."
