    "intro": "Astragalus cryptobotrys, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant has compound leaves with pairs of oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus cryptobotrys is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important component of desert ecosystems."
