    "intro": "Acetosella calva, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of white flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its leaves are often covered in fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss and protect against herbivory. Acetosella calva is also known for its ability to form dense mats, which can stabilize soil and prevent erosion.",
