    "intro": "Apinagia divaricata, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant."
