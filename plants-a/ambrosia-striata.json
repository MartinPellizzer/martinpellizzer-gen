    "intro": "Ambrosia striata, commonly known as the common ragweed, is an annual flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in late summer. The plant is known for its allergenic pollen, which can cause significant respiratory issues in sensitive individuals. Ambrosia striata thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas. It plays a role in both ecological systems and human health due to its widespread distribution and impact."
