    "intro": "Acaena longiscapa, commonly known as the long-stemmed burr plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its woody, shrub-like structure with dense, spiny bracts. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by the development of persistent, spherical burrs. These burrs contain seeds that are adapted for dispersal by animals, contributing to the plant's ecological role in its native habitat. Acaena longiscapa is often found in coastal and mountainous regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight.",

This plant thrives in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas. It is adapted to the harsh climate and limited soil nutrients of its native habitat. Acaena longiscapa plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is part of the native flora of Bolivia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena longiscapa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. The plant has since become naturalized in various parts of the country. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest edges. However, it is considered a potential weed in some regions due to its ability to spread rapidly."
