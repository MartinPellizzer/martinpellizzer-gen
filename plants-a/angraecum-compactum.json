    "intro": "Angraecum compactum, commonly known as the compact angraecum, is a species of orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with long, slender petals and a distinctive spur. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Angraecum compactum is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
