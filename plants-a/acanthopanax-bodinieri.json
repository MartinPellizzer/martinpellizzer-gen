    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthopanax bodinieri is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland and hill forest areas. This plant thrives in humid environments with well-drained soil, often growing along riverbanks or in shaded undergrowth. It is a climbing shrub that can reach significant heights, making it a notable component of the local flora. Due to its adaptability, it is also occasionally found in adjacent regions like southern China and parts of Indonesia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopanax bodinieri was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. The plant has been found growing in moist, shaded areas along forest edges and stream banks. It has shown some invasive tendencies in certain areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Due to its rapid spread, it is now considered a potential threat to local ecosystems."
