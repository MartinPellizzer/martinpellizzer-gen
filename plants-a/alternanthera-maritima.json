    "intro": "Alternanthera maritima, commonly known as seaAlternanthera, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in saline environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or purple in color. It thrives in sandy or muddy soils near the shoreline, often in tidal zones. Due to its salt tolerance, it is sometimes used in coastal restoration projects."
