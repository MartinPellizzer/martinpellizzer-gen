    "intro": "Asperula charophyton, commonly known as the mountain cranberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in late spring. These flowers are followed by red or orange berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. Asperula charophyton is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
