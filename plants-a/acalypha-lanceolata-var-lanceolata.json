This species is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in coastal areas or near water bodies. It thrives in humid climates and is often associated with mangrove or brackish water environments. The plant is well adapted to saline conditions and can tolerate fluctuating water levels. Its wide distribution suggests a strong ecological adaptability across diverse island and mainland habitats.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha lanceolata var. lanceolata was mainly introduced to Niue, Tokelau-Manihiki. It is a variant of the species Acalypha lanceolata, which is known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various environmental conditions. The plant is typically found in coastal areas and disturbed sites, where it can thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Its introduction to these regions may have been for ornamental purposes or as part of ecological restoration efforts. However, its impact on local ecosystems requires further study to assess any potential invasive tendencies."
