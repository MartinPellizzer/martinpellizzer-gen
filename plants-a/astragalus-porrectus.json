    "intro": "Astragalus porrectus, commonly known as the straight astragalus, is a species of legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are pinnate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus porrectus is part of the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root system."
