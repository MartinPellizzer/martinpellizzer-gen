It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring striking purple or violet hooded flowers that resemble a monk's habit. The plant has large, deeply lobed leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its roots contain toxic alkaloids, making it a plant of both botanical interest and caution. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.",
