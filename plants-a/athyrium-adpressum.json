    "intro": "Athyrium adpressum, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its compact, dense foliage and small, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense mats. Athyrium adpressum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in partial shade."
