    "intro": "Artemisia desertorum var. foetida, commonly known as desert wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, aromatic foliage and small, yellowish-gray flower clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Its essential oils, which give it a strong, pungent scent, have been used in traditional medicine for their antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. The species is also valued in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and ability to prevent soil erosion."
