    "intro": "Arachniodes haniffii, commonly known as the Haniff's spider fern, is a unique evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble the legs of a spider, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctively intricate structure that contributes to its ornamental appeal."
