    "intro": "Angolluma rogersii, commonly known as the Rogers' ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance and pale green or white flowers that bloom during the spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as pine flatwoods and wetlands. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and requires careful preservation efforts."
