    "intro": "Anthericum pomeridianum, commonly known as the evening lily, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that open in the late afternoon and remain open through the night. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, with a dark green color and a slightly waxy texture. The flowers are usually pale yellow or white, with a distinctive, complex structure that aids in pollination by nocturnal insects."
