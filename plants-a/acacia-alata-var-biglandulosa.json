    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia alata var. biglandulosa is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the southern and western regions of the state. This variety thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and inland habitats. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of the region. The plant is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia alata var. biglandulosa was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas with sandy soils, particularly in the Western and Eastern Cape provinces. This plant is often used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and attractive foliage. However, it has also been reported to spread aggressively in some environments, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. Its introduction has led to discussions about its ecological impact and management in native ecosystems."
