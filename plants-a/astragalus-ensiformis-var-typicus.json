It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. It has a deep taproot system, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Astragalus ensiformis var. typicus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
