    "intro": "Aristolochia setosa, commonly known as the slender Dutchman's pipe, is a perennial vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a distinct, hollow interior. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a somewhat bitter taste. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and can climb using its tendrils. However, it is toxic to humans and animals, containing aristolochic acids that can cause severe health issues."
