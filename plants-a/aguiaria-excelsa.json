    "intro": "Aguiaria excelsa, commonly known as the Brazilian walnut, is a large evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody fruits containing edible seeds. Its seeds, known as Brazil nuts, are enclosed in a hard shell and are commercially valuable. Aguiaria excelsa plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
