    "intro": "Albizia euryphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mimosa, is a deciduous legume native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are narrow and often have a feathery appearance, and its clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces flat, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, and it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Albizia euryphylla is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and reforestation efforts."
