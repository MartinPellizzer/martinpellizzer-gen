    "intro": "Arabis divaricarpa var. hemicylindrica, commonly known as the narrow-cylindrical rockcress, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with hairy stems and basal leaves that are narrowly elliptic in shape. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems, and bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
