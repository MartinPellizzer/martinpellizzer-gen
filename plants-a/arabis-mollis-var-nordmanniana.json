    "intro": "Arabis mollis var. nordmanniana, commonly known as the Nordmann's rockcress, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silvery-green, hairy leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers in early spring, which are arranged in elongated racemes. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This species is often cultivated in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and hardy nature."
