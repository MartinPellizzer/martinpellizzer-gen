    "intro": "Artemisia desertorum var. longiflora, commonly known as the longflower wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, aromatic foliage and small, yellowish-green flower heads that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their antiseptic and digestive properties. The variety is distinguished by its longer floral stalks compared to the typical form of Artemisia desertorum."
