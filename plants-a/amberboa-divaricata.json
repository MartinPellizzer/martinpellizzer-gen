    "intro": "Amberboa divaricata, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces berries that are toxic to humans and animals, containing solanine and other alkaloids. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though caution is necessary due to its poisonous nature."
