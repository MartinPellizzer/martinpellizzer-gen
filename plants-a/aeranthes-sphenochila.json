    "intro": "Aeranthes sphenochila, commonly known as the broadleaf orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. The flowers are often arranged in a spike and are pollinated by insects, making it an important component of its ecosystem."
