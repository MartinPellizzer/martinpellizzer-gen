It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow leaves. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as mountainous regions and forest understories. Its botanical features include a robust rhizome system and a distinctive flowering structure. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species for conservation and botanical study."
