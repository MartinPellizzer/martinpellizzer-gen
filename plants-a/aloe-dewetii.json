    "intro": "Aloe dewetii, commonly known as the Natal aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, spiky leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their soothing properties. Aloe dewetii prefers well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
