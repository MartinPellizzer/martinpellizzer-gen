    "intro": "Astragalus simulans, commonly known as the mimic milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus simulans is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
