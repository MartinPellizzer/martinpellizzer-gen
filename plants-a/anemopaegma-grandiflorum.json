It is native to South Africa and typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. The plant features slender, branched stems with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a silky texture. Its showy, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
