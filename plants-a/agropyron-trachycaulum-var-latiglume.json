    "intro": "Agropyron trachycaulum var. latiglume, commonly known as the rough wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a valuable plant for erosion control. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are tightly clustered. It is often used in restoration projects and as a forage crop for livestock. The variety latiglume is distinguished by its specific morphological traits, including the structure of its glumes and lemma."
