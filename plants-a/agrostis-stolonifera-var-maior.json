    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera var. maior, commonly known as the common bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender,\u530d\u5310\u7684 stems that form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that becomes darker in cooler weather. It is often used in turfgrass applications due to its fine texture and ability to form a dense, uniform sod."
