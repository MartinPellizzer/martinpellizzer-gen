    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera var. calcicola, commonly known as the coastal bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of western North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fine, blue-green foliage. This variety thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and coastal conditions. It plays a vital role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in coastal ecosystems. Its adaptability makes it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects in maritime environments."
