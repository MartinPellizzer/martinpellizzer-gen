It is characterized by its dense, narrow leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to thrive in coastal and sandy environments, often found along the Atlantic coast. It produces small, round, reddish-brown fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and coastal landscapes."
