    "intro": "Astragalus polaris, commonly known as the polar milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in areas with low temperatures and limited nutrients. The plant produces small, yellow to green flowers arranged in clusters, which are adapted to attract pollinators in its harsh environment. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in cold, nutrient-poor conditions. Astragalus polaris plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing food for local wildlife in its native habitats."
