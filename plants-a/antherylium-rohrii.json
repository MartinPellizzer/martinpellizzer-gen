    "intro": "Antherylium rohrii, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, translucent, and often bioluminescent flowers that emit a faint glow in the dark. The plant has a short lifespan, with its flowers blooming only for a brief period before withering. Its botanical structure consists of a slender, leafless stem that supports the delicate, cup-shaped inflorescence. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, Antherylium rohrii remains a subject of scientific curiosity and conservation interest."
