    "intro": "Atriplex cinerea subsp. incrassata, commonly known as silverleaf shadscale, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its gray-green, succulent leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in compact clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in saline soils, making it an important component of desert ecosystems. The subspecies incrassata is distinguished by its broader, more robust leaves compared to the typical form of A. cinerea."
