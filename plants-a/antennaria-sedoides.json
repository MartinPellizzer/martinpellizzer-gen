    "intro": "Antennaria sedoides, commonly known as the stickyweed or yellow sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments in the western United States. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, and its leaves are typically covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant has a compact, mat-like growth form, which helps it conserve moisture in harsh conditions. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to anchor in loose, sandy soils. Antennaria sedoides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and arthropods."
