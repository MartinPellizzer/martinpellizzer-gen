    "intro": "Antennaria virginica var. argillicola, commonly known as the claybank penny-cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, clay-rich soils along streambanks and wetlands. Its leaves are basal, alternate, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is adapted to wetland environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in these habitats."
