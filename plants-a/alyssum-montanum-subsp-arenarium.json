    "intro": "Alyssum montanum subsp. arenarium, commonly known as sand alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its mat-forming habit, with small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, oval to elliptic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its resilience to drought and heat makes it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
