    "intro": "Astiella antsalovansis, commonly known as the Madagascar astiella, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, aromatic leaves that emit a distinctive scent. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its habitat is primarily in the dry, rocky regions of southern Madagascar. Due to its restricted range and limited research, it remains a rare and understudied species."
