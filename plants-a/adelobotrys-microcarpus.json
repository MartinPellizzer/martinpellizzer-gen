    "intro": "Adelobotrys microcarpus, commonly known as the small-fruited pomegranate, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, red, fleshy fruits. The plant produces flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in clusters. Its fruit, though edible, is not as well-known as the common pomegranate, and it is often used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.",
