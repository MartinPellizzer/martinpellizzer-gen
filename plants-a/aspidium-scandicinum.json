    "intro": "Aspidium scandicinum, commonly known as the climbing wood fern, is a vascular fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit, supported by rhizomes that root at intervals along the stem. The plant features fronds that are usually bipinnate, with a distinctive, often arching shape. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Aspidium scandicinum plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
