    "intro": "Agropyron ciliare subsp. minor, commonly known as the lesser wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and pastures. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
