    "intro": "Armeria capitella, commonly known as the sandverbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, fleshy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves adapted to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. It is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats, where it is resistant to salt spray and wind. Armeria capitella plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing coastal soils."
