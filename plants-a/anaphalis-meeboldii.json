    "intro": "Anaphalis meeboldii, commonly known as the meebold's mouse-eared gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing in open meadows at elevations above 3,000 meters. Anaphalis meeboldii is adapted to cold climates and has a slow growth rate, making it a rare and delicate species."
