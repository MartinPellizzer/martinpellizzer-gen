    "intro": "Angraecum darainense, commonly known as the Darainese orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It features long, pendant-like inflorescences with white, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid native habitat. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in conservation programs."
