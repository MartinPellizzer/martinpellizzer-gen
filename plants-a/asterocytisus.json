    "intro": "Asterocytisus, commonly known as the silverbush, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These shrubs are native to southern Europe and are characterized by their silvery-gray foliage and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The leaves are often densely covered with fine hairs, giving them a distinctive appearance. Asterocytisus species are typically evergreen, with compact growth habits that make them suitable for rock gardens and borders. They thrive in well-drained soil and full sun, producing blooms in shades of pink, white, and purple."
