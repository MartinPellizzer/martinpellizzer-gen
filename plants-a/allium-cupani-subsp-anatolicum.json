It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, fleshy leaves. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear umbel-like clusters of white to pale purple flowers. Its bulbs are often used in local cuisines for their mild, onion-like flavor. Botanically, it is distinguished by its subspecific traits and adaptation to arid and semi-arid environments."
