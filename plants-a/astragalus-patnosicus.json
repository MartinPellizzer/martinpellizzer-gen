    "intro": "Astragalus patnosicus, commonly known as the Sierra foothill milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its slender stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant has compound leaves with numerous leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils. Astragalus patnosicus is also valued for its ecological importance to native pollinators and its potential medicinal properties."
