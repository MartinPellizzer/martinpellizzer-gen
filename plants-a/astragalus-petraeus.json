    "intro": "Astragalus petraeus, commonly known as the rock milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species in harsh environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across rocky landscapes."
