It features narrow, willow-like leaves that are lanceolate and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy blue to purple flower heads in the fall, which are composed of numerous small ray florets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
