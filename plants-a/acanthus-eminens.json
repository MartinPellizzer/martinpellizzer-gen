    "intro": "Acanthus eminens, commonly known as the giant acanthus, is a striking perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, giving it a dramatic, tropical appearance. The plant produces showy, spires of violet-blue flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its lush foliage and vibrant blooms.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthus eminens is primarily native to Ethiopia, Kenya, Sudan-South Sudan, and Uganda. This plant is commonly found in regions with tropical and subtropical climates within these countries. It thrives in open areas, grasslands, and along riverbanks. The species is well adapted to the variable environmental conditions of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus eminens was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as stream banks and forest floors. This plant is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and competitive nature. It spreads through underground rhizomes, making it difficult to control. Its presence can alter native plant communities and reduce biodiversity in affected ecosystems."
