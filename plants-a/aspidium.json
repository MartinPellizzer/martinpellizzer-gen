    "intro": "Aspidium, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Aspidiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are usually bipinnate or tripinnate, with a fan-like appearance. The plants typically grow in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. Aspidium species have a rhizomatous growth habit, and their sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds. These ferns are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often used in horticulture."
