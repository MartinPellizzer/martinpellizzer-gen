    "intro": "Amauropelta aculeata, commonly known as the spiny shield fern, is a unique member of the Osmundaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in small, spiny projections. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. The species is notable for its primitive features and is often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere."
