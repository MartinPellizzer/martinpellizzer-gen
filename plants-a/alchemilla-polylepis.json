    "intro": "Alchemilla polylepis, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that resembles a shield, giving it the common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in branched cymes. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Alchemilla polylepis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
