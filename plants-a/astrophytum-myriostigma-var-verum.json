    "intro": "Astrophytum myriostigma var. verum, commonly known as the \"true\" star cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a smooth, pale green to bluish-gray stem covered in radial spines and areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, which bloom from the areoles. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun with minimal water. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for succulent collections."
