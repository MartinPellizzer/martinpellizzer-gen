    "intro": "Arundinella setosa var. lasiostoma, commonly known as the hairy bamboo or narrow-leafed arundinella, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves with fine hairs along the margins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, often in disturbed or moist soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its hardy and adaptable nature."
