    "intro": "Aucuba himalaica var. dolichophylla, commonly known as the long-leaf aucuba, is a shrub native to the Himalayan region. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are elongated and have a distinctive, wavy margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forested areas. The varietal form, dolichophylla, is distinguished by its longer, more slender leaves compared to the typical species."
