    "intro": "Austrostipa setacea, commonly known as the silky grass, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Austrostipa setacea is adapted to arid environments, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in sandy soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
