    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaciella martensis is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, particularly the Greater Antilles. It is found in regions such as Cuba, Hispaniola, and Jamaica. This plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often associated with coastal areas. It is commonly found in limestone soils and is adapted to the tropical climate of the region. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaciella martensis was mainly introduced to the western coast of Mexico, particularly in the states of Nayarit and Jalisco. It is commonly found in coastal areas, where it thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with dune ecosystems. This plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions, making it a resilient species in these environments. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities."
