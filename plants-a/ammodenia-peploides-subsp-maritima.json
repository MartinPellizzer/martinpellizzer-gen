    "intro": "Ammodenia peploides subsp. maritima, commonly known as the coastal ammodenia, is a perennial shrub native to the western coast of the United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, needle-like leaves that are adapted to coastal conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Its botanical features make it well-suited for stabilizing coastal dunes and resisting salt spray."
