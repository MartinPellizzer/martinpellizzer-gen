    "intro": "Astragalus canispinus, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow or greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in dry, sandy soils and withstand periods of drought. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus canispinus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
