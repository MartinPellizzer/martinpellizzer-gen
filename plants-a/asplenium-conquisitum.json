    "intro": "Asplenium conquisitum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a rare and unusual fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, waxy, and velvety fronds that are covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. Asplenium conquisitum is often found in association with other moisture-loving plants, making it a valuable indicator species for certain habitats."
