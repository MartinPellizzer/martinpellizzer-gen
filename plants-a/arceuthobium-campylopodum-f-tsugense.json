    "intro": "Arceuthobium campylopodum f. tsugense, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches to the stems of fir trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and red, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, often leading to reduced growth and vitality in the host tree. Botanically, it is notable for its unique propagation method, where seeds are dispersed through a mechanism called autochory."
