    "intro": "Acerates ivesii, commonly known as the Ives' maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically five-lobed and have a vibrant green color during the growing season. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a temperate climate with adequate sunlight. Due to its ornamental value, Acerates ivesii is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape tree.",
