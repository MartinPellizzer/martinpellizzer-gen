    "intro": "Arachnorchis orestes, commonly known as the golden spider-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It features a slender, hairy stem and produces a single, showy yellow or orange flower with a distinctive spider-like appearance. The plant typically grows in heathland and forested areas, thriving in well-drained soils. It is a perennial herb that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
