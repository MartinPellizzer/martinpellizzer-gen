It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, contributing to aquatic ecosystem stability. Its botanical features make it an important species for wetland conservation and ecological studies."
