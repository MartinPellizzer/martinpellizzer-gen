    "intro": "Aloe pseudoangulata, commonly known as the angular aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine and for their soothing properties. Aloe pseudoangulata is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water to thrive."
