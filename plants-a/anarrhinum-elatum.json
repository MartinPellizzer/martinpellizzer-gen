    "intro": "Anarrhinum elatum, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high temperatures and low precipitation. Anarrhinum elatum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
