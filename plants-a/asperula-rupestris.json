    "intro": "Asperula rupestris, commonly known as rock asperula, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, fragrant white flowers in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Asperula rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand coastal and rocky conditions."
