    "intro": "Arenaria diandra, commonly known as the sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils, making it a common sight in arid and coastal environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Arenaria diandra is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
