    "intro": "Astragalus andrachneifolius var. depauperatus, commonly known as the sparseleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, compound leaves that are often reduced in size, giving it a sparse appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are typically clustered in racemes. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
