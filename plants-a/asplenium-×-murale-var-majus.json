    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 murale var. majus, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a hybrid species within the Asplenium genus. It is characterized by its large, broad, leathery leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly curled margin. The plant produces small, clustered spores on the underside of its fronds, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting."
