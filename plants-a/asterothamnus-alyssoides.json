    "intro": "Asterothamnus alyssoides, commonly known as the silky thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. The plant features a basal rosette of soft, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a composite head, and bloom from late spring to early summer. Asterothamnus alyssoides is often used in dry gardens and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
