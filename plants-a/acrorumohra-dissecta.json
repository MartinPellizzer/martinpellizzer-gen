    "intro": "Acrorumohra dissecta, commonly known as the dissected fern, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are finely divided, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spiky inflorescences, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not widely consumed. The plant's botanical features make it a unique addition to botanical gardens and a subject of interest for botanists studying tropical flora.",
