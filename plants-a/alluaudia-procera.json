    "intro": "Alluaudia procera, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and moths. Its leaves are typically small and may be absent in mature plants, giving it a distinctive appearance. The sap of Alluaudia procera is milky and can cause skin irritation, making it important to handle the plant with care."
