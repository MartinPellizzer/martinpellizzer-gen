    "intro": "Acalypha ambigua, commonly known as the zigzag plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its unique, zigzagging stems that aid in water conservation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia. Its leaves are typically alternate, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Acalypha ambigua is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha ambigua is primarily native to Angola, Burundi, DR Congo, Namibia, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. This shrub or small tree is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It thrives in moist to semi-arid environments, often growing in woodlands or along riverbanks. The plant is well adapted to the diverse climates of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining soil stability.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha ambigua was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as gardening and landscaping. It is commonly found in disturbed areas, including roadsides, vacant lots, and along urban edges. The plant spreads primarily through its prolific seed production and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to its establishment in several regions outside its native range. However, it is generally considered a non-invasive species with minimal impact on native ecosystems."
