    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abildgaardia parvinux is primarily native to the southern United States, specifically Texas and New Mexico. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and limestone areas. This plant is commonly associated with scrublands and grasslands in these regions. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can survive in harsh, dry climates. Its native range is limited, making it a rare and specialized species in its habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abildgaardia parvinux was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can spread rapidly in disturbed habitats. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to disrupt local ecosystems."
