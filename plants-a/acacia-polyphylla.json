    "intro": "Acacia polyphylla, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and birds. Acacia polyphylla is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various arid and semi-arid environments. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in native Australian flora.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia polyphylla is primarily native to eastern Australia, including regions in New South Wales, Queensland, and the Australian Capital Territory. It is commonly found in dry sclerophyll forests and open woodlands. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with rocky or sandy substrates. It is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of southern Australia, characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. Acacia polyphylla is also known to occur in parts of South Australia and the Northern Territory.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia polyphylla was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a Mediterranean climate, where it can thrive in full sun. It is commonly found in regions with mild winters and hot, dry summers. This plant is often used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and attractive foliage. It has been introduced to parts of California and the southwestern United States. However, it can become invasive in some environments if not properly managed."
