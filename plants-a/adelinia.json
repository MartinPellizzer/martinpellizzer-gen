    "intro": "Adelinia, commonly known as the climbing bean or velvet bean, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports. The leaves are typically pinnately compound, and the flowers are small, often yellow or greenish in color. Adelinia species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. They produce pods containing edible seeds, which are sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a food source."
