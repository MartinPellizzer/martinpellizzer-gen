    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies grandis pendula is primarily native to western North America, specifically the Pacific Northwest region of the United States and southern British Columbia in Canada. It is commonly found in mountainous areas with moist, well-drained soils. This species thrives in subalpine and montane forests, often growing at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. It is particularly associated with the Cascade and Olympic Mountains. The plant is known for its distinctive weeping form, which makes it a notable ornamental and ecological species in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies grandis pendula was mainly introduced to enhance ornamental value in gardens and landscapes due to its unique weeping form. It is commonly found in regions with temperate climates where it thrives in well-drained soils. This plant is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ability to add visual interest to parks and private properties. However, it requires careful management to prevent potential invasiveness in natural habitats. Its introduction has been documented in several countries outside its native range."
