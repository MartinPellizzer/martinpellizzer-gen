    "intro": "Alyssum diffusum var. corymbosum, commonly known as sweet alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves and is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Alyssum diffusum var. corymbosum is also known for its ability to attract beneficial insects such as bees and butterflies."
