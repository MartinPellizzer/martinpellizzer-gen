    "intro": "Astragalus maiusculus, commonly known as the small milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Astragalus maiusculus is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and preventing soil erosion."
