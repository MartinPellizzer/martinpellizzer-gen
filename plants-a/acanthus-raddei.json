    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthus raddei is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa. It is found in the eastern and western regions of the country. This plant thrives in coastal areas and sandy soils. It is commonly associated with the fynbos biome, which is known for its unique biodiversity. Acanthus raddei is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to the region's climate and soil conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus raddei was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates, particularly in parts of Europe and North America. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. This plant has been introduced as an ornamental due to its striking foliage and unique flower structure. However, it is considered invasive in some areas, outcompeting native species for resources. Its distribution has expanded rapidly since its introduction, raising concerns about its ecological impact."
