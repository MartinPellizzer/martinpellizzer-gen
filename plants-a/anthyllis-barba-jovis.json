It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, which are composed of three small leaflets. The plant is typically found in rocky or sandy soils and is often associated with arid or semi-arid environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Anthyllis barba-jovis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
