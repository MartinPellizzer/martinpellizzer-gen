    "intro": "Atriplex \u00d7 gustafssoniana var. kattegatensis, commonly known as the Kattegat saltbush, is a halophyte native to the coastal regions of the Kattegat Sea in northern Europe. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in saline and arid environments. The plant typically grows in low vegetation, often forming dense mats near the shoreline. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in inflorescences, and it reproduces through seeds dispersed by wind. This variant is notable for its adaptability to extreme coastal conditions, making it an important species in coastal ecology."
