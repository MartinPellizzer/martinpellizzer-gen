    "intro": "Arrabidaea littoralis, commonly known as the coastal arrabidaea, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant features small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in coastal conditions. Arrabidaea littoralis plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
