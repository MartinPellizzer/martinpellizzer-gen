    "intro": "Aspidium megalodus, commonly known as the giant wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant has a robust rhizome system that helps it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically arranged in a single row along the margins of the fronds. Aspidium megalodus is native to various regions in Asia and is often found in forest understories where it thrives in high humidity and partial shade."
