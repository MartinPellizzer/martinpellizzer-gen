    "intro": "Amygdalus glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular almond or sticky almond, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance. The plant produces white to pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by small, hairy fruits that contain almond-like seeds. Amygdalus glandulosa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
