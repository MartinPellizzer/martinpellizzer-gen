    "intro": "Acacia sophorae, commonly known as the Chinese acacia, is a flowering plant native to China and other parts of East Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves and yellow floral spikes. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Acacia sophorae is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important plant in ecological restoration projects. Its ornamental value also makes it a popular choice for landscaping in warmer climates.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia sophorae is primarily native to New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, and Victoria. This shrub or small tree is commonly found in various habitats across these regions. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often seen in open woodlands and along coastal areas. The plant is well adapted to the temperate and semi-arid climates of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia sophorae was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or loamy soils and a warm, temperate climate. It thrives in regions with moderate rainfall and full sun exposure. This plant is commonly found in coastal and inland dunes, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes. Its introduction has been noted in several parts of the southeastern United States. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
