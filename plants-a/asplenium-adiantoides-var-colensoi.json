It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, rusty-colored bloom. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found in forest understories. It has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light."
