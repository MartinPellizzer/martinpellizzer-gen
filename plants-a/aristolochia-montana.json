It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-brown in color. The plant produces small, yellow fruits that contain seeds dispersed by animals. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
