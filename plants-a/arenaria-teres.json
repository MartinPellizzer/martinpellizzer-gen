    "intro": "Arenaria teres, commonly known as the mossy sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils, adapting to harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are linear and closely appressed to the stem, contributing to its compact appearance. Arenaria teres plays a role in stabilizing soil in extreme habitats and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas."
