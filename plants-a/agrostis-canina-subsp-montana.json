It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It is characterized by its adaptability to a range of soil types and its ability to thrive in cooler climates. Botanically, it is notable for its rhizomatous growth habit and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects."
