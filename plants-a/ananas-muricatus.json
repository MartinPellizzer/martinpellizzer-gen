It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its dense, spiky leaves that form a rosette shape. The plant produces a fruit that is smaller and more acidic than the common pineapple, with a rough, scaly skin. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange and are followed by a fleshy, edible fruit. Ananas muricatus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of unique, flavorful fruit."
