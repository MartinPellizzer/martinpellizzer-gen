    "intro": "Arabis ariana, commonly known as the Armenian rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important plants such as broccoli and cabbage. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a fine layer of hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its arid habitat."
