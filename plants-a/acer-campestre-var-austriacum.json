    "intro": "Acer campestre var. austriacum, commonly known as the Austrian Field Maple, is a variant of the Field Maple native to Central Europe. It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree or shrub, typically reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with five to seven shallow lobes, and turn vibrant shades of yellow and red in autumn.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer campestre var. austriacum is primarily native to Central Europe, including parts of Germany, Austria, and the Czech Republic. It is commonly found in woodlands, hedgerows, and along riverbanks in these regions. This variety of the European mountain ash thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with mixed forests. It is a hardy shrub or small tree that can tolerate partial shade to full sun. Its native range reflects its adaptation to the temperate climate of Central Europe.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer campestre var. austriacum was mainly introduced to urban and suburban landscapes in North America and Europe for its ornamental value. It is valued for its compact size, vibrant fall color, and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. This variety is often used in landscaping as a shade tree or hedge due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements. However, it has also been reported to naturalize in some areas, raising concerns about its potential invasive behavior. Its introduction has expanded its geographic range beyond its native European habitats."
