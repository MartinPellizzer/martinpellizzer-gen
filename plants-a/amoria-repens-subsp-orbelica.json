    "intro": "Amoria repens subsp. orbelica, commonly known as the creeping amoria, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy texture. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides."
