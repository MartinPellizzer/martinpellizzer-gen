    "intro": "Argentina stenophylla, commonly known as the Andean fern, is a species of fern native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Argentina stenophylla plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small invertebrates."
