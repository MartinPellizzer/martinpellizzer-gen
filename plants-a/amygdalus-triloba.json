It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets. The plant produces small white or pinkish flowers in early spring, followed by the development of almond-like fruits. The seeds, or drupes, contain a single edible kernel surrounded by a hard shell. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
