    "intro": "Aristida purpurea var. longiseta, commonly known as purple threeawn, is a perennial grass species native to the United States. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pink to purple in color. The plant produces fine, bristly hairs on its leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive, rough texture. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils, and is often found in the central and eastern regions of North America. This grass is adapted to full sun and is relatively drought-tolerant, making it a common component of native grassland ecosystems."
