    "intro": "Amylotheca salomonia, commonly known as the Salomonia lichen, is a unique lichen species that exhibits a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga. It is characterized by its crust-like growth form, typically found on rocky surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments. The thallus of Amylotheca salomonia is usually pale yellow to orange in color, with a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface. It plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its native habitats. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is often used as an indicator species for environmental conditions."
