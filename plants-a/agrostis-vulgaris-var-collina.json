    "intro": "Agrostis vulgaris var. collina, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, upright stems that are usually less than 30 cm tall, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a loose to dense cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates."
