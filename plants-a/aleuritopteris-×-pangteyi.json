    "intro": "Aleuritopteris \u00d7 pangteyi, commonly known as the hybrid water fern, is a sterile hybrid between Aleuritopteris plicata and Aleuritopteris japonica. It is a member of the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds with a distinctive, finely pinnate structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in humid forests. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with spore-producing structures on the underside. Despite being sterile, it is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions."
