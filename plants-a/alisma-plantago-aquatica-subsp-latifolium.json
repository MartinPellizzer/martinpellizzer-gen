    "intro": "Alisma plantago-aquatica subsp. latifolium, commonly known as broadleaf water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow water, wetlands, and along the margins of ponds and streams. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often floating or partially submerged, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by water. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing aquatic habitats and supporting biodiversity."
