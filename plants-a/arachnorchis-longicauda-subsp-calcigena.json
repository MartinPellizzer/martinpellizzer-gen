    "intro": "Arachnorchis longicauda subsp. calcigena, commonly known as the limestone spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid endemic to southern Australia. It features a slender, leafless stem with a single, showy greenish-yellow flower that has a distinctive, spider-like appearance. The plant thrives in calcareous soils, often found in open habitats such as heathlands and sandplains. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, and it is known for its resilience in arid environments. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
