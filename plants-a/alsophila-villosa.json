    "intro": "Alsophila villosa, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a tall, slender tree fern characterized by its fibrous, silver-green fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk covered in a thick layer of sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a soft, hairy texture on the underside. Alsophila villosa thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
