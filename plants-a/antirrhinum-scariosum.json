It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, two-lipped flowers. The plant typically produces bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy layer that helps reduce water loss.
