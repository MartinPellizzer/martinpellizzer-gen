    "intro": "Acaena patagonica, commonly known as the Patagonian burr bush, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and spiny, bristly fruit capsules. The plant produces small white or pink flowers that are typically visited by insects for pollination. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a hairy texture. Acaena patagonica is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in dry, rocky soils and coastal areas.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena patagonica is primarily native to Argentina South and Chile South. It is commonly found in the southern regions of these countries, particularly in the Patagonian area. This plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. It is often seen in grasslands and shrublands, contributing to the local biodiversity. Its distribution is closely linked to the unique environmental conditions of the southern Andes.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena patagonica was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of Chilean flora during the 19th century. The plant was likely introduced through horticultural exchanges or accidental transport with other plant species. It has since become naturalized in several regions of New Zealand, particularly in the North Island. However, it is not considered invasive and has not caused significant ecological disruption."
