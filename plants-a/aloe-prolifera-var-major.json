    "intro": "Aloe prolifera var. major, commonly known as the giant aloe or tree aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, columnar growth habit with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its robust nature makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and as a houseplant."
