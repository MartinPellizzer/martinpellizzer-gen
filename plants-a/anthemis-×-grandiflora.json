    "intro": "Anthemis \u00d7 grandiflora, commonly known as the hybrid chamomile, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a cross between Anthemis tinctoria and Anthemis nobilis, resulting in a plant with a compact growth habit and dense foliage. The leaves are aromatic, covered in fine white hairs, and the flowers are bright yellow with a central dark brown or black disk. It produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. This plant is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and mild medicinal properties."
