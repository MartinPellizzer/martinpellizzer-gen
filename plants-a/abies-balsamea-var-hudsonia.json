    "intro": "Abies balsamea var. hudsonia, commonly known as Hudson's fir, is a variant of the balsam fir native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter than those of the typical balsam fir. The plant produces cones that are usually reddish-brown and contain small, winged seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in boreal and subarctic regions. Its botanical features make it an important species in forest ecosystems and a subject of ecological study.",

It is found in regions such as New York, Vermont, and New Brunswick. This variant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically in boreal and subarctic regions. It is commonly associated with coniferous forests and rocky outcrops. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches that provide the necessary conditions for its growth.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies balsamea var. hudsonia was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils in mixed forests and along stream banks. This variety is known for its pyramidal shape and attractive reddish-brown bark. It has been used in horticulture for its ornamental value and for reforestation efforts. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
