    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia verugera f. latisiliqua is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is commonly found in savannas and shrublands. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can survive in areas with low rainfall. The species is often used as a source of timber and for its hardy, drought-resistant properties. Its distribution is largely restricted to the southwestern and central parts of the African continent.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia verugera f. latisiliqua was mainly introduced to regions with Mediterranean climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. It is commonly found in coastal areas and dry landscapes, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. This plant is known for its dense foliage and ability to tolerate drought conditions, which contributes to its widespread use in horticulture. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in non-native environments. Due to its adaptability, it has been cultivated in various parts of the world, including southern Europe, North Africa, and parts of the United States."
