It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
