    "intro": "Adiantum polymorphum, commonly known as the variable maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Adiantum polymorphum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in indoor conditions with proper care.",
