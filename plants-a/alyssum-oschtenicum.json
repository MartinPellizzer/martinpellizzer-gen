    "intro": "Alyssum oschtenicum, commonly known as the silverleaf alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and profuse clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant features silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Alyssum oschtenicum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
