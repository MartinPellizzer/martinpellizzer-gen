    "intro": "Arrhenatherum barbatum, commonly known as the tufted feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of spikelets, which are adorned with bristle-like structures. This grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
