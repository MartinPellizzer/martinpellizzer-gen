    "intro": "Athyrium filix-femina subsp. alpestre, commonly known as the Alpine lady fern, is a perennial fern native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or rocky soils. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in rocky or loamy substrates. It blooms with spore-producing sorus clusters on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
