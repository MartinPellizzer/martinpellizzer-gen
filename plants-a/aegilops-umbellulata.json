    "intro": "Aegilops umbellulata, commonly known as the wheatgrass or slender wild rye, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and marginal habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Aegilops umbellulata is also valued for its potential in forage and as a source of genetic material for wheat improvement."
