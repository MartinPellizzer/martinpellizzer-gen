    "intro": "Armeria plantaginea subsp. castellana, commonly known as the Castilian thrift, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils. It is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
