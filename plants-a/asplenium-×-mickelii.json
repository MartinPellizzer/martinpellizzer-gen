    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 mickelii, commonly known as the Mickel's spleenwort, is a hybrid fern that belongs to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that typically measure between 10 to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. As a hybrid species, it exhibits a mix of traits from its parent plants, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
