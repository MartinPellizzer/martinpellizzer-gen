    "intro": "Acuan covillei, commonly known as the Coville's acuan, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acuan covillei is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival. Its botanical features make it an important subject for botanical research and ecological studies.",
