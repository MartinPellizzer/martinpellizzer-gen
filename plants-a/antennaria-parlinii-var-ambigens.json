    "intro": "Antennaria parlinii var. ambigens, commonly known as the ambiguous sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, typically clustered in the axils of the leaves. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas such as coastal dunes and rocky slopes."
