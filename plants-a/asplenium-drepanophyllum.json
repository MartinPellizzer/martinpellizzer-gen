    "intro": "Asplenium drepanophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often arching or drooping. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and produce clustered spore-bearing structures called sorus. Asplenium drepanophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light."
