It is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, fleshy fruits that resemble sponge-like structures, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid, shaded environments. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The tree's unique morphology and aromatic properties make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
