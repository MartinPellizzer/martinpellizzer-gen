    "intro": "Arenaria capillaris lusus brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and sandy soils in temperate regions. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early spring. The plant has thin, wiry stems and tiny, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is often found in alpine and coastal environments where it thrives in well-drained soil. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor habitats."
