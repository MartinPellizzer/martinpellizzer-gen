    "intro": "Agropyron stenostachyum, commonly known as the slender-stemmed wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, which are adorned with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides and meadows, and is well adapted to low-nutrient soils. Agropyron stenostachyum is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
