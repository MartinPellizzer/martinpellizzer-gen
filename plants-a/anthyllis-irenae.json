    "intro": "Anthyllis irenae, commonly known as the Irenaean burr. It is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, characterized by its upright growth habit and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces distinctive, spiny pods that contain seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by attachment to animal fur or clothing. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as scrublands and coastal areas. Anthyllis irenae is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
