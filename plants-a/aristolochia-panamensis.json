    "intro": "Aristolochia panamensis, commonly known as the Panama birth vine, is a climbing plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its unique, tubular flowers that resemble a female reproductive organ, a feature used to attract specific pollinators. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, dark berries that are toxic to humans but may serve as food for certain animals. It is often found in humid, tropical forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in some cultures. However, due to its toxic properties, it requires caution when handling or cultivating."
