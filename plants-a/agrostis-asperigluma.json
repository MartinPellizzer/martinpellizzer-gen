    "intro": "Agrostis asperigluma, commonly known as rough-stemmed bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Eurasia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a loose panicle. It produces small, spikelet-like flowers that are wind-pollinated. Agrostis asperigluma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass mixtures."
