    "intro": "Anthemis biseta, commonly known as the Spanish wallflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or dry soils, often found in coastal areas and along roadsides. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with a strong, peppery scent, which attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in arid conditions. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
