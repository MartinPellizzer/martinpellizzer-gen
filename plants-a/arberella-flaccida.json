    "intro": "Arberella flaccida, commonly known as the limp willow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the wetlands of North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, arching stems that are covered in small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are tiny and clustered in spikes, producing a subtle white or greenish hue. Arberella flaccida is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic wildlife."
