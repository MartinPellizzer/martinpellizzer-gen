    "intro": "Athyrium fructuosum, commonly known as the fruiting lady fern, is a deciduous fern native to eastern North America. It features delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm long, with a graceful, arching appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups called sorus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Athyrium fructuosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates."
