    "intro": "Acer obtusatum var. malvaceum, commonly known as the Malva-leaf maple, is a variant of the obtusatum maple species. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of the Malva genus, hence its common name. The plant is native to Japan and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its foliage displays vibrant autumn colors, making it a popular ornamental tree. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge.",
