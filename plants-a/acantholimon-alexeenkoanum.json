    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon alexeenkoanum is primarily native to Tajikistan. It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the eastern and southern parts. This plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. It is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the Central Asian mountains. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within Tajikistan, making it a rare and localized species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon alexeenkoanum was mainly introduced to areas with specific soil and climate conditions that mimic its native habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers moderate temperatures. This plant has been introduced to regions where its ornamental value or ecological benefits are sought after. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in non-native environments. Proper monitoring is essential to ensure it does not disrupt local ecosystems."
