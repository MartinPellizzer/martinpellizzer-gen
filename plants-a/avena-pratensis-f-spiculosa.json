    "intro": "Avena pratensis f. spiculosa, commonly known as slender oat, is a variant of the common oat species characterized by its compact, spiculate inflorescence. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in moist, temperate climates, often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. The botanical name reflects its close relationship to the parent species, Avena pratensis."
