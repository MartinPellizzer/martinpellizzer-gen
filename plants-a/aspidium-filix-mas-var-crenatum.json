    "intro": "Aspidium filix-mas var. crenatum, commonly known as the crested male fern, is a variant of the common male fern native to temperate regions. It is a perennial fern characterized by its distinctive, compound fronds that often exhibit a serrated or crenate edge. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia clusters. The botanical features of this fern make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical studies."
