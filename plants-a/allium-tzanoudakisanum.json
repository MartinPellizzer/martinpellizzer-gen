    "intro": "Allium tzanoudakisanum, commonly known as the Greek leek, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, garlic-like flavor, making it a valuable crop in Mediterranean cuisine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
