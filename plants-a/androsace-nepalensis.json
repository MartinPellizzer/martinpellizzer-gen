    "intro": "Androsace nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal rock-jelly, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Nepal and surrounding Himalayan areas. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in spring, producing white or pale pink flowers that are adapted to the cold, high-altitude environment. Its leaves are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Androsace nepalensis is often found growing on rocky slopes and meadows, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils."
