    "intro": "Avena sativa var. strigosa, commonly known as rough oat, is a variant of the oat species characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and stems. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with spikelets that bear small, oval-shaped grains. Its foliage is often more rugged and less palatable compared to other oat varieties, making it less suitable for human consumption but valuable for forage or erosion control. The botanical features of this variety include its distinctive pubescence and adaptability to various soil conditions."
