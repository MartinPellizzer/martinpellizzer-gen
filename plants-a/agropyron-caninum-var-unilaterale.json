    "intro": "Agropyron caninum var. unilaterale, commonly known as the one-sided wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects or as a forage crop."
