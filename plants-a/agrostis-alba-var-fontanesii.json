    "intro": "Agrostis alba var. fontanesii, commonly known as the white bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green leaves and tufted inflorescence, which consists of small spikelets. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, dunes, and along coastal areas. Its ornamental value is appreciated in horticulture for its delicate appearance and ability to form dense, soft turf. The plant is also valued for its role in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
