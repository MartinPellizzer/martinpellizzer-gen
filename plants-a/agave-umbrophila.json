    "intro": "Agave umbrophila, commonly known as the shade agave, is a species of agave native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowering stalk produces a tall inflorescence with small, greenish-white flowers. Agave umbrophila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
