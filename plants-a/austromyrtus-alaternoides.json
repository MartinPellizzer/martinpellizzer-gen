    "intro": "Austromyrtus alaternoides, commonly known as the Australian tea tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub native to eastern Australia. It features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its aromatic foliage contains compounds used in traditional Aboriginal medicine and in the production of essential oils. Austromyrtus alaternoides is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments."
