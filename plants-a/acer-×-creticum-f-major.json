    "intro": "Acer \u00d7 creticum f. major, commonly known as the giant maple, is a hybrid species within the maple genus, characterized by its large, lobed leaves that can reach up to 20 cm in length. It is native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly in China, where it thrives in cool, humid climates. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its ornamental value lies in its striking foliage, which displays vibrant colors during the autumn season. This cultivar is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil types.",
