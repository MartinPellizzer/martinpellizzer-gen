The tree has a rounded crown and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds. Its leaves are typically palmately lobed, with serrated edges and a dark green upper surface. This cultivar is valued for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions.",
