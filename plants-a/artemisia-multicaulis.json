It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which consists of finely divided, aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and rocky habitats. Artemisia multicaulis is known for its strong, distinctive aroma and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
