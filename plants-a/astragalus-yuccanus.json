    "intro": "Astragalus yuccanus, commonly known as the Yucca milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its spiny, branched stems and clusters of small, yellowish to greenish flowers. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Astragalus yuccanus is sometimes used in traditional medicine and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
