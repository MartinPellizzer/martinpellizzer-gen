    "intro": "Aspidium canum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, triangular-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp woodlands. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Aspidium canum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance."
