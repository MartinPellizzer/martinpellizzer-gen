    "intro": "Anemopaegma prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate anemopaegma, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and ray florets. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its compact growth habit, it is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in arid landscapes."
