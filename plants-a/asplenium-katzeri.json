    "intro": "Asplenium katzeri, commonly known as the Katzer's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It typically grows on rocks or tree bark in moist, shaded environments, often in temperate regions. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and closely arranged along the stem. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typically in clusters. Asplenium katzeri is noted for its delicate appearance and is often found in humid, woodland habitats."
