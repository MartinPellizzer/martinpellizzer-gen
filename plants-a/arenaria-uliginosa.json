    "intro": "Arenaria uliginosa, commonly known as marsh sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats on moist soil, often in bogs, fens, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has small, succulent leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early summer. It is adapted to nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for assessing wetland health."
