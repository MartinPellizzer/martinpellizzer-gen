    "intro": "Artemisia leucophylla, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer. Artemisia leucophylla is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. It is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
