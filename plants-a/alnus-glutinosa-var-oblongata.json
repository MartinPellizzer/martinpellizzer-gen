    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa var. oblongata, commonly known as the sticky alder, is a variant of the European alder. It is a deciduous tree or shrub characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves that are elliptical to oblong in shape. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers followed by woody, cone-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or wetlands. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration projects."
