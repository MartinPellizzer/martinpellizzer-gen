It is characterized by its clustered, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmately compound leaves with a sticky surface, which is a distinguishing feature of this subspecies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
