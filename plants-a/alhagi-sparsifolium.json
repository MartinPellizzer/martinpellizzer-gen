    "intro": "Alhagi sparsifolium, commonly known as the sparse-leaved goatweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a shrub or perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or saline soils, showing a high degree of drought tolerance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It has a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it well adapted to harsh environments. Alhagi sparsifolium is also known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in degraded ecosystems."
