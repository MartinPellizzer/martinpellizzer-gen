    "intro": "Acinodendron saldanhae, commonly known as the Saldanha's acinodendron, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the island of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 in the Gulf of Guinea. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and trees, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, where it thrives in the understory of dense vegetation. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change.",
