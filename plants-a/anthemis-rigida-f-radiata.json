    "intro": "Anthemis rigida f. radiata, commonly known as the radiate anthemis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces bright yellow flowers with a central disc surrounded by ray florets. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its foliage is aromatic, often described as having a camphor-like scent, which can be both a distinguishing feature and a natural defense mechanism. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and adaptability to arid environments."
