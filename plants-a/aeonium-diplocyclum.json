It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, bluish-green leaves that form a compact, cushion-like shape. The plant produces vibrant orange to red flowers in spring, which are borne on tall, branching stems. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. Aeonium diplocyclum is popular in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
