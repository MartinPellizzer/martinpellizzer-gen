    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria f. patulipilosa, commonly known as the broad-leaved kidney vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from pink to purple. This variety is native to parts of Europe and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, which enriches the soil and supports other plant life. Its growth habit is generally low and spreading, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
