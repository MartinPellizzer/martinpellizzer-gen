    "intro": "Asparagus pilosus, commonly known as the hairy asparagus, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and produces small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system for water retention. Its stems are covered in fine, hairy structures that help reduce water loss. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
