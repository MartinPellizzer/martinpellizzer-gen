    "intro": "Alnus jorullensis var. exigua, commonly known as the dwarf alder, is a small shrub or tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, catkin-like flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range. The species is relatively rare and has limited distribution, making it of interest to botanists and conservationists."
