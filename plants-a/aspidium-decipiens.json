    "intro": "Aspidium decipiens, commonly known as the false scaly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are often covered in small, scaly structures. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are typically evergreen, with a distinctive appearance that can resemble other fern species, hence its common name. Aspidium decipiens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often used in shady garden settings."
