    "intro": "Astragalus inopinatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, yellowish to brownish flowers. The plant has compound leaves with pairs of leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil conditions. Astragalus inopinatus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
