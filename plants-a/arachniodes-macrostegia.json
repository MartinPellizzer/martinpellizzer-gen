    "intro": "Arachniodes macrostegia, commonly known as the giant spider fern, is a striking evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant features a distinctive, creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. Arachniodes macrostegia thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
