    "intro": "Airopsis obtusata, commonly known as the broad-leaved sea lettuce, is a marine green alga that thrives in shallow coastal waters. It forms dense, turfs of dark green to bluish-green color, often found on rocky substrates. The plant has a simple, unbranched thallus with broad, flat, and fleshy leaves that are typically 2-5 cm in length. It reproduces both sexually and asexually, with the release of motile zoospores into the water. Airopsis obtusata plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
