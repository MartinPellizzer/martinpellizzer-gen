    "intro": "Allium montenegrinum, commonly known as the Montenegro garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers. The plant produces edible bulbs that are similar in appearance to garlic but have a milder flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat."
