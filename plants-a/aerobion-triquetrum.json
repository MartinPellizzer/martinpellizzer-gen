    "intro": "Aerobion triquetrum, commonly known as the three-angled water clover, is a small aquatic plant characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The leaves are submerged and have a triangular shape, which helps in maximizing light absorption. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged or floating. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality maintenance."
