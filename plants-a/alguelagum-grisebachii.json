    "intro": "Alguelagum grisebachii, commonly known as the gray sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and purple. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Alguelagum grisebachii plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in xerophytic habitats."
