    "intro": "Artemisia integrifolia f. subulata, commonly known as silver sagebrush, is a variant of the sagebrush species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, subulate (awl-shaped) leaves that are densely covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in terminal panicles, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. Its aromatic properties and drought tolerance make it an important component of its ecological community."
