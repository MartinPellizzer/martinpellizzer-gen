    "intro": "Airopsis steudelii, commonly known as the red sea fan, is a marine coral that belongs to the order Gorgonacea. It is characterized by its branching, fan-like structure composed of calcium carbonate exoskeletons and soft, fleshy polyps. The coral thrives in shallow, warm waters and is often found in reef environments. Its polyps are typically red or pink, providing a striking contrast to the skeletal framework. Airopsis steudelii plays an important role in marine ecosystems by offering habitat and shelter to various small marine organisms."
