It is characterized by its large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night and close by dawn. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor. Its rapid growth habit makes it an effective cover plant in gardens. Aporum lunatum thrives in warm, humid climates and requires support for its climbing structure."
