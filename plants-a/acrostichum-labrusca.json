    "intro": "Acrostichum labrusca, commonly known as the broadleaf fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, compound fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests or along riverbanks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist soil, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds. Acrostichum labrusca plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystems.",
