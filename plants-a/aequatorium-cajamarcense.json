    "intro": "Aequatorium cajamarcense, commonly known as the Cajamarca waterwheel, is a rare aquatic plant native to the Peruvian Amazon. It is characterized by its unique, spiraling arrangement of leaves that resemble a waterwheel, which helps it capture light and water efficiently. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as marshes and flooded forests. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Aequatorium cajamarcense plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
