    "intro": "Aleuritopteris doniana, commonly known as the African cliff fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and robust, allowing it to anchor firmly in challenging substrates. Aleuritopteris doniana plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms in its native ecosystems."
