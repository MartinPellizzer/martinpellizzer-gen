    "intro": "Aconitum \u00d7 sturiense, commonly known as the hybrid monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue to purple flowers. The plant features palmately compound leaves with a distinctive basal rosette, and its roots are tuberous, which contribute to its hardiness in cold climates. Aconitum \u00d7 sturiense is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its dramatic appearance. However, it is toxic and should be handled with care.",
