    "intro": "Alyssum xerophilum, commonly known as the desert alyssum, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, with small, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to efficiently absorb moisture from the soil. Alyssum xerophilum is often used in xeriscaping due to its resilience and ornamental value."
