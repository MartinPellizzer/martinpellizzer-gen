    "intro": "Arenaria ciliata var. tenella, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically features small, rounded leaves that are densely covered with fine hairs, aiding in water retention in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. Its compact growth habit and frost-resistant nature make it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
