    "intro": "Agave cubensis, commonly known as the blue agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are blue-gray in color and form a rosette pattern. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that can reach several meters in height, bearing small greenish-white flowers. Its most notable feature is the core, or pi\u00f1a, which is used to make tequila. Agave cubensis is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its leaves and stem."
