    "intro": "Anthoclitandra, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Loranthaceae. It typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as those in the genus *Eucalyptus*, and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized root structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are small, leathery, and often clustered at the base of the stems. Anthoclitandra is native to Australia and is often found in woodland and rainforest environments."
