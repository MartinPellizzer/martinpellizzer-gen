    "intro": "Alnus februaria var. parvifolia, commonly known as the dwarf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are usually less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces catkins, which are its male and female flowers, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils. It has a shallow root system that can help in soil stabilization. This species is also known for its early spring flowering, which occurs before its leaves emerge."
