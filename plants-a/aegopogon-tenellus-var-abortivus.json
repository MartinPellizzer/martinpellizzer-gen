    "intro": "Aegopogon tenellus var. abortivus, commonly known as the abortive goat's beard, is a variant of the goat's beard plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while the plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides. This variant is distinguished by its reduced floral structures, giving it a more compact appearance compared to the typical form of Aegopogon tenellus. It is generally not cultivated for ornamental purposes but is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphological features."
