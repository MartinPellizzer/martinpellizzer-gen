    "intro": "Asplenium viride var. poscharskyanum, commonly known as the green maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern, characterized by its lush, dark green fronds. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. The fronds are bipinnate, with finely divided, silky-textured leaves that give the plant a delicate, ornamental appearance. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. This variety is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in gardens or as a houseplant."
