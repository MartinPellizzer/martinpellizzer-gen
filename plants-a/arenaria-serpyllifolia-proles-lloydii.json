    "intro": "[WRONG START] Arenaria serpylyllifolia proles lloydii, commonly known as the Sierra sandwort, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada range in California. It is a low-growing herb with small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has compact, mat-forming foliage with tiny, rounded leaves that help it survive in harsh, alpine conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, sunny environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
