    "intro": "Arachnorchis oenochila, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on the trunks of trees, forming a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, and it produces small, pale green or white flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
