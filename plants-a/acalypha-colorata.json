    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha colorata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with forest understories or disturbed sites. It is also present in parts of southern China and the Pacific Islands. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions outside its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha colorata was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its vibrant foliage and ornamental value. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its aesthetic appeal. The plant has been introduced to various parts of the world, including the United States, Australia, and parts of Southeast Asia. However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas where it can outcompete native vegetation. Proper management is necessary to prevent its spread in non-native environments."
