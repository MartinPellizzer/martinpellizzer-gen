    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha polynesiaca is primarily native to the Pacific Islands, including Samoa, Tonga, and the Cook Islands. It is commonly found in coastal areas and moist lowland forests. This species thrives in humid tropical climates and is often seen growing along shorelines and in disturbed habitats. It plays an important role in the local ecosystems of these regions. The plant is also known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha polynesiaca was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species. It was initially brought there for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since spread rapidly and is now considered a noxious weed. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and can outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to significant ecological impacts on local ecosystems."
