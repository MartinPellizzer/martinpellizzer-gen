    "intro": "Acer platanoides var. globosum, commonly known as the European mountain ash or globosum maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or forested areas. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ecological benefits in natural landscapes.",
