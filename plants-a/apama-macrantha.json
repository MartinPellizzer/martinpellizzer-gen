    "intro": "Apama macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered apama, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the family Myrtaceae. It is native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia, where it typically grows in brackish or freshwater habitats. The plant is characterized by its showy, fragrant white to pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Apama macrantha plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and fish species."
