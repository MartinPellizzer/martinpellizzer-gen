    "intro": "Asplenium bireme, commonly known as the two-row spleenwort, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage. It is a small epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a distinctive rosette-shaped frond with two rows of spore-producing structures called sorangia. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Asplenium bireme is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in moist, shaded conditions."
