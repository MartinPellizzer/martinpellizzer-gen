    "intro": "Abrochis, commonly known as the silverweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with silver-gray foliage. The leaves are typically opposite and covered in fine, white hairs that give the plant its distinctive appearance. Abrochis species produce small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. These plants are often found in rocky or gravelly soils and are adapted to dry, sunny environments."
