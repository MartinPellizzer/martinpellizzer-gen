    "intro": "Astragalus indurescens, commonly known as the hardening milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. The plant has hairy, branching stems and produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of yellow to pink. Its leaves are compound, with numerous small leaflets, and the plant is known for its deep root system that helps it survive in harsh conditions. Astragalus indurescens is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats."
