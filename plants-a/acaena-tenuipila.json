    "intro": "Acaena tenuipila, commonly known as the slender spinulose nettle, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its small, spiny leaves and produces yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in moist, temperate environments. It is often found in coastal and subalpine regions, where it contributes to soil stabilization. Acaena tenuipila is also valued for its potential use in traditional M\u0101ori medicine.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena tenuipila is primarily native to South America, specifically Chile and Argentina. It is commonly found in the temperate regions of these countries. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. It is well adapted to the local climate and soil conditions. Its distribution is largely restricted to the southern parts of South America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena tenuipila was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of New Zealand flora to other regions. The plant is now considered an invasive species in several areas outside its native range. It spreads rapidly and can outcompete native vegetation. Its distribution is primarily confined to disturbed or cultivated areas where it thrives in sunny conditions."
