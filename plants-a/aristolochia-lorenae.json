    "intro": "Aristolochia lorenae, commonly known as the Lorena's Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It is characterized by its unique, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, musky aroma. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and has a complex, branched root system. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in understory layers of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
