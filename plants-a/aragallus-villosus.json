    "intro": "Aragallus villosus, commonly known as the hairy aragallus, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its branched, often hairy stems and compound leaves. It typically grows in moist, temperate regions and is often found in meadows or along stream banks. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its root system is fibrous, and the plant is sometimes cultivated for its edible roots, though it is less common than other members of its family. Aragallus villosus is noted for its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in partial shade."
