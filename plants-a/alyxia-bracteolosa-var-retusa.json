    "intro": "Alyxia bracteolosa var. retusa, commonly known as the smoothleaf alyxia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along stream banks. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are smooth and oval-shaped, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains several seeds, contributing to its role in local ecosystems."
