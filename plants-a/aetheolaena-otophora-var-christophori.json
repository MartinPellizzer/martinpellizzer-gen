It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which resembles a spider's web, with long, slender floral stems and intricate, colorful flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, showcasing a specialized ecological relationship. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
