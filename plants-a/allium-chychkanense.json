    "intro": "Allium chychkanense, commonly known as the Chychkan onion, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces edible bulbs that are similar in taste to garlic and are used in local cuisines. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cold winter dormancy period for proper growth. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
