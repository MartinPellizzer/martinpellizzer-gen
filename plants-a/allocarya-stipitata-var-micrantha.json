    "intro": "Allocarya stipitata var. micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to arid and rocky habitats in southern Africa. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for Mediterranean and semi-arid climates."
