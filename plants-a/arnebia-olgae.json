    "intro": "Arnebia olgae, commonly known as the mountain arnebia, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant red or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy layer, which helps reduce water loss. Arnebia olgae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
