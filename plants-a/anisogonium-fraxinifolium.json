    "intro": "Anisogonium fraxinifolium, commonly known as the black walnut, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and a distinctive, aromatic wood. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in pendulous clusters, followed by edible nuts enclosed in a hard, green husk. Its botanical features include a deep root system and the ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in ecological restoration. The plant is also noted for its toxic properties, particularly in its seeds and leaves."
