    "intro": "Acacia meisneri, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and small, feathery leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are typical of the Acacia genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Acacia meisneri is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia meisneri is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the state, particularly in the Pilbara and Goldfields areas. This species thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with shrublands and open woodlands. It is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the region, including high temperatures and low rainfall. Acacia meisneri plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and stabilizing soil in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia meisneri was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become an invasive species. It was initially brought there for its ornamental value and potential for soil stabilization. However, it has since spread rapidly, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. Its introduction has led to significant ecological concerns, including habitat degradation and biodiversity loss. Efforts are now underway to control its spread and mitigate its impact on native flora."
