This plant is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests within these island nations. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soils. The species is often seen growing along riverbanks and in shaded undergrowth. Its natural distribution reflects its adaptation to the unique ecological conditions of the Pacific Islands.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha repanda var. repanda was mainly introduced to Society Is. It is believed to have been brought there intentionally for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and unique growth habit. The plant has since become established in the local environment, thriving in the tropical climate. It is commonly found in gardens and along coastal areas where it can receive ample sunlight. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant species."
