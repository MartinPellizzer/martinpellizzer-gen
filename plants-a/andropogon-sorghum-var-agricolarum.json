    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum var. agricolarum, commonly known as grain sorghum, is a tall, warm-season grass native to Africa and widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions. It features erect, cylindrical stalks with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of spikelets that bear small, two-lobed flowers. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a valuable crop for grain production. Its botanical structure includes a fibrous root system and a robust stem that supports its heavy grain heads. The species is closely related to other members of the Poaceae family and is economically important for food, feed, and industrial uses."
