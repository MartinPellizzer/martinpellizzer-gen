It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Caucasus region, characterized by its pinnately compound leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, edible drupes with a sweet, nutty flavor, similar to its parent species. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for its potential in horticultural breeding programs."
