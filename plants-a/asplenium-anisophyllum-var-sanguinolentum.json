    "intro": "Asplenium anisophyllum var. sanguinolentum, commonly known as the blood fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern. It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds with a dark reddish-brown hue along the midrib. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The unique coloration of its fronds makes it a striking addition to botanical collections and gardens."
