It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, pale green flowers in spikelets, which are clustered along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Arcion minus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
