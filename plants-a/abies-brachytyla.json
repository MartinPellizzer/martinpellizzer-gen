    "intro": "Abies brachytyla, commonly known as the dwarf white fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in high elevations, often in subalpine or alpine habitats, where it forms dense stands. The tree has a slender, often crooked trunk and short, horizontal branches that bear needle-like leaves. Its cones are small and cylindrical, maturing to a reddish-brown color. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique form and winter interest.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies brachytyla is primarily native to the mountainous regions of western North America, including parts of British Columbia, Alberta, and the Yukon in Canada, as well as the western United States. It is commonly found in subalpine and alpine zones, growing at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. This species thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils, often forming dense stands in coniferous forests. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches, making it a characteristic species of the Pacific Northwest. Abies brachytyla is also present in some areas of central Alaska and the northern Sierra Nevada range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies brachytyla was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically in mountainous or high-altitude regions. It is commonly found in the Pacific Northwest of the United States and parts of western Canada. This species is often planted in urban landscapes for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded conditions. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly. Its distribution has expanded due to human activity and climate change."
