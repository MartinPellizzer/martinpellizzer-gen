    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acampe papillosa var. flava is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia. It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. This variety is known for its yellow flowers and is often associated with moist, sandy soils. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators. However, its distribution is limited and it is considered a rare plant in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acampe papillosa var. flava was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers. The introduction occurred in the late 19th century during the colonial period. It has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. However, it is not considered invasive and poses minimal ecological risk."
