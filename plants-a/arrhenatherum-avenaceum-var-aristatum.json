    "intro": "Arrhenatherum avenaceum var. aristatum, commonly known as the tall meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and riverbanks. The plant features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting insect and bird populations."
