    "intro": "Amblystigma castillonii, commonly known as the Castillon's amblystigma, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions in southern Europe. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous or forested areas. Its botanical features include finely divided leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
