    "intro": "Astragalus boissieri, commonly known as the Boissier milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with numerous leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Astragalus boissieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
