    "intro": "Acanthoprasium integrifolium, commonly known as the smoothleaf acanthoprasium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. The plant has slender, upright stems and lanceolate leaves that are entire, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense, terminal spikes, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. The species is characterized by its low-growing habit and is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological value.",

This plant thrives in rocky and limestone soils, often growing in open habitats. It is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of Cyprus. Its distribution is largely confined to the native flora of the country.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthoprasium integrifolium was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and disturbed forests. It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region. It has been reported in several states including Virginia, Tennessee, and North Carolina. Its introduction has been associated with human activity, such as land clearing and transportation corridors."
