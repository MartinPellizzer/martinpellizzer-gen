    "intro": "Aconitum lycoctonum var. ranunciloides, commonly known as the meadow aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has a tall, erect stem covered with coarse hairs and lance-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
