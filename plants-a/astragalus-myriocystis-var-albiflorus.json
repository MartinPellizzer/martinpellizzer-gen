    "intro": "Astragalus myriocystis var. albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in dry, sandy soils. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve nutrient content."
