    "intro": "Allium gillii, commonly known as the Sierra onion, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a tall, leafless stem that bears small, white, star-shaped flowers in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, sweet flavor, making it a valuable plant for both culinary and ornamental purposes. Allium gillii thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine environments."
