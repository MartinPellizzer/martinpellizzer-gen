    "intro": "Anthemis cotula var. vectensis, commonly known as the lesser tansy, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, yellowish-white composite flowers arranged in flat, disc-like clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. The plant has aromatic leaves with a camphor-like scent, which is due to the presence of essential oils. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas. Its botanical structure includes alternate, linear leaves and a fibrous root system, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions."
