    "intro": "Astragalus macilentus, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are pinnately compound, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus macilentus plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
