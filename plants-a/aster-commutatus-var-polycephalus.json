    "intro": "Aster commutatus var. polycephalus, commonly known as the hairy aster, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded areas with well-drained soil. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
