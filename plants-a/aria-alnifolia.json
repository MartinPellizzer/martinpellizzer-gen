    "intro": "Aria alnifolia, commonly known as the alderleaf willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia and Europe. It belongs to the Salicaceae family, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in catkins, typically in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, often resembling those of alder trees. Aria alnifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands."
