    "intro": "Arctium egregium, commonly known as the showy burdock, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaves. The plant features tall, hairy stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. Its most distinctive feature is the spiky, brown burrs that form at the end of its flowering stems, which contain seeds enclosed in a fibrous husk. These burs are adapted for attachment to animals and clothing, aiding in seed dispersal."
