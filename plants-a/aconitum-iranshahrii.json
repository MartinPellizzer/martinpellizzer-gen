    "intro": "Aconitum iranshahrii, commonly known as the Iranian aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Iran. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are typically arranged in racemes. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, wavy margin. Like other aconites, it contains potent alkaloids, making it toxic to both humans and animals.",
