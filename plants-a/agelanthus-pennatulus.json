It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
