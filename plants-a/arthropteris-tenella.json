    "intro": "Arthropteris tenella, commonly known as the small fern or the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that root at the nodes. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, linear pinnae that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. Arthropteris tenella thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in forest understories."
