    "intro": "Alaticaulia guttulata, commonly known as the spotted alpine shrub, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are pollinated by insects. Its leaves and stems are covered in distinctive spots or glands, giving it its scientific name. Alaticaulia guttulata is adapted to cold, dry environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems."
