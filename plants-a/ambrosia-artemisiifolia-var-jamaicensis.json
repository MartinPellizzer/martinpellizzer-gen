It is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Caribbean, characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are wind-pollinated, contributing to its allergenic potential. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural areas and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common weed in tropical and subtropical regions."
