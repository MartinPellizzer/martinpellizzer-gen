    "intro": "Artemisia semavinensis, commonly known as the Persian wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flower heads that are typically clustered in dense, flat-topped inflorescences. Artemisia semavinensis is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Its essential oils contain compounds such as thujone and camphor, which contribute to its medicinal and aromatic properties."
