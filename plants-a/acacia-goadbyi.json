    "intro": "Acacia goadbyi, commonly known as the Goadby's wattle, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, yellow-scented flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that function as leaves, and it produces small, woody pods that contain seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions with deep roots and a low water requirement. Acacia goadbyi plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia goadbyi is primarily native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is commonly found in the Pilbara and Kimberley regions, where it thrives in sandy soils and dry climates. This species is often associated with rocky outcrops and coastal dunes. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for native wildlife. Acacia goadbyi is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia goadbyi was mainly introduced to Australia as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature. It is commonly found in regions with a Mediterranean climate, such as southern Australia. The plant has been introduced to several states, including New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. It has also been reported in some parts of Queensland, although its spread there is less common. Despite its ornamental value, it is considered a potential weed in certain areas where it can outcompete native vegetation."
