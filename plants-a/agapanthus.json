    "intro": "Agapanthus, commonly known as the African lily, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, umbel-like clusters of blue, white, or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant features broad, strap-shaped leaves that are typically evergreen, providing a lush backdrop to its showy blooms. Agapanthus thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
