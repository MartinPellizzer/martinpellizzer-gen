    "intro": "Antidesma retusum, commonly known as the African snowberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by spherical, white or pale green berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including forest edges and disturbed soils, and is often found in moist or semi-arid regions. The plant's ornamental value is limited due to its toxic fruits, but it plays a role in local ecosystems as a food source for certain wildlife."
