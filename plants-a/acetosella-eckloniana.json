    "intro": "Acetosella eckloniana, commonly known as the spring beauty, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically has a rosette of hairy, oval-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in its preferred moist, woodland habitats. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with five petals and prominent yellow stamens. Acetosella eckloniana is often found in shaded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting early pollinators.",
