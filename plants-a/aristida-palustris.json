    "intro": "Aristida palustris, commonly known as marsh dropseed, is a perennial grass native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshes, swales, and other moist environments, often forming dense, low-growing clumps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, fluffy seed heads that are characteristic of the grass family. Its ability to thrive in saturated soils makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Aristida palustris is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
