    "intro": "Allocarya hispidula var. tenera, commonly known as the soft-hairy lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It features a dense, velvety upper surface covered with short, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The thallus is typically greenish to yellowish in color, with a leathery consistency. It grows on bark, wood, and soil in temperate regions, often forming dense mats. This variety is notable for its ability to tolerate moderate levels of pollution, making it a useful indicator species in ecological studies."
