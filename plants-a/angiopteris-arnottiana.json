    "intro": "Angiopteris arnottiana, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a large, evergreen fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the rachis. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to 5 meters. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds. Angiopteris arnottiana thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate rainforests."
