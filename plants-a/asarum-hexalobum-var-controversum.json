It is characterized by its large, triangular, compound leaves that are densely covered with soft, hairy tissue. The plant produces small, yellowish spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fertile leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional herbal medicine."
