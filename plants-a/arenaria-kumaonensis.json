    "intro": "Arenaria kumaonensis, commonly known as the Kumaon sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky soils and high-altitude environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, which helps in reducing water loss in its arid habitat. Arenaria kumaonensis plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its native alpine ecosystems."
