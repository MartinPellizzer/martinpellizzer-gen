    "intro": "Alyssum suffrutescens var. olympicum, commonly known as Olympic Alyssum, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage with fuzzy leaves, which help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
