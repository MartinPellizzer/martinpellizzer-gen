    "intro": "Acetosa tmolea, commonly known as the narrowleaf mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, basal rosettes of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue or violet flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Acetosa tmolea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators.",
