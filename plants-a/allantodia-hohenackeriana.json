    "intro": "Allantodia hohenackeriana, commonly known as the Hohenacker's allantodia, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
