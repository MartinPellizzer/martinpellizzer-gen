    "intro": "Achillea millefolium subsp. caroli, commonly known as Carpathian yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and flat, composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and rocky soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its flowers, which range from white to pinkish-red, bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and geographic distribution compared to the broader A. millefolium species.",
