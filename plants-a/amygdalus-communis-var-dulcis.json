    "intro": "Amygdalus communis var. dulcis, commonly known as the sweet almond tree, is a variety of the Prunus genus native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves and showy white or pink flowers that appear in spring. The tree produces drupes with a hard pit enclosed in a fleshy outer layer, which contain the edible seeds used for almond production. The fruit's outer hull is typically removed before processing, and the seeds are dried and roasted for culinary and industrial uses. This plant is valued for its economic importance in agriculture and its ornamental appeal in gardens."
