    "intro": "Apochoris pentapetala, commonly known as the five-petaled orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, five-petaled flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Apochoris pentapetala is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
