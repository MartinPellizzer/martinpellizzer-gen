    "intro": "Asplenium robustum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of polypody fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically broad and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Asplenium robustum thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forests and rocky crevices. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and horticultural collections."
