    "intro": "Aconitum campylorrhynchum var. tenuipes, commonly known as the narrow-leaved monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, arranged in a spire-like inflorescence. The plant has palmately compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its roots contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous to handle. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in woodland environments. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and botanical collections.",
