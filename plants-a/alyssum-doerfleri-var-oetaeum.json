    "intro": "Alyssum doerfleri var. oetaeum, commonly known as the Oetaean alpine alyssum, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit, with hairy, gray-green leaves that help it retain moisture in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cool, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
