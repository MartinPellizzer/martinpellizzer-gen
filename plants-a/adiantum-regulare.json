    "intro": "Adiantum regulare, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, lacy fronds that give it a distinctive, almost ethereal appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait that aids in nighttime photosynthesis. Adiantum regulare is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.",
