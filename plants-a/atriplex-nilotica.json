It is characterized by its succulent leaves, which are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to saline soils and can thrive in areas with low rainfall. Atriplex nilotica is also valued for its edible leaves and has been used in traditional medicine for various ailments."
