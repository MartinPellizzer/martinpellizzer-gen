    "intro": "Ambrosia trifida var. normalis, commonly known as giant ragweed, is a tall annual herb native to North America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and yellow-green flowers that appear in late summer. The plant produces copious amounts of wind-pollinated pollen, which can cause allergic reactions in humans. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in agricultural fields. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it a significant weed in many regions."
