    "intro": "Allium ambiguum, commonly known as the wild leek, is a perennial herb native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of long, narrow leaves. The plant produces a flower stalk that bears umbels of white or pale purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, garlic-like flavor, making it a valuable plant in traditional cuisines. Allium ambiguum is also noted for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
