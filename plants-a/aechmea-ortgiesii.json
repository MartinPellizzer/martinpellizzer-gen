    "intro": "Aechmea ortgiesii, commonly known as the silver pine bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica and Panama. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright red flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aechmea ortgiesii is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
