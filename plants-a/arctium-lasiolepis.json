    "intro": "Arctium lasiolepis, commonly known as the hairy burdock, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces purple to brown flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by distinctive, woody, spiky fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its roots are thick and fibrous, often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Arctium lasiolepis thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in meadows."
