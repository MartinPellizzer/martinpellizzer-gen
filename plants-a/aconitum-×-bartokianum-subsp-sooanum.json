    "intro": "Aconitum \u00d7 bartokianum subsp. sooanum, commonly known as the Sooan monkshood, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which are arranged in a helmet-shaped structure typical of the genus Aconitum. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and a deep green color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
