    "intro": "Astracantha glabrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf star-thorn, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Its botanical features make it well adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone regions."
