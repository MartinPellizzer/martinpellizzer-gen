The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in branched clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. Its foliage is known for its ability to retain moisture, which contributes to its resilience in various environmental conditions."
