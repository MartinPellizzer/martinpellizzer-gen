    "intro": "Amauropelta brausei, commonly known as the Brause's shield fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of hair. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in cloud forests and other moist, tropical habitats. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing soruses, are positioned on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Amauropelta brausei is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
