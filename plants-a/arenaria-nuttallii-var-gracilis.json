    "intro": "Arenaria nuttallii var. gracilis, commonly known as slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as dunes or rocky slopes. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its overall compact appearance. It is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
