It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in cooler, humid environments and is often found in high-altitude grasslands. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
