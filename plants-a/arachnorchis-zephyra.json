    "intro": "Arachnorchis zephyra, commonly known as the wind orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats and requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive. Its unique morphology includes a specialized root system that helps it absorb moisture from the air, an adaptation to its arid environment. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
