It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its tiny, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showcasing adaptations to harsh conditions. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Astragalus pygmaeus is often considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
