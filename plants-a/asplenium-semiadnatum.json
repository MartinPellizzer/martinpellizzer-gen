    "intro": "Asplenium semiadnatum, commonly known as the mouse-tail fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or on rocky outcrops. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the ground, forming dense mats. Asplenium semiadnatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
