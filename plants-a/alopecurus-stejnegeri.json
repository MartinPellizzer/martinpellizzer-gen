    "intro": "Alopecurus stejnegeri, commonly known as the stejneger's mouse-ear, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is a small, tufted perennial grass that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found in areas with high soil moisture. Alopecurus stejnegeri is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
