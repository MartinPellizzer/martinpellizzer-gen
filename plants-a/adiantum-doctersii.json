    "intro": "Adiantum doctersii, commonly known as the golden maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green with a subtle golden hue. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture to flourish. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of the fronds. Adiantum doctersii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.",
