    "intro": "Atriplex cinerea subsp. rhagodioides, commonly known as silverleaf shadscale, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, powdery hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically appearing in late spring. Its leaves are alternate, lanceolate, and often have a waxy coating that reduces water loss. This species is adapted to arid environments and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats."
