    "intro": "Arthratherum arenarium, commonly known as the sandgrass, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family (Poaceae). It is a low-growing perennial species that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its ability to survive in harsh conditions makes it an important component of stabilizing sandy soils. Arthratherum arenarium is typically found in regions such as southern Europe, North Africa, and parts of the Middle East."
