    "intro": "Atriplex nummularia subsp. eunummularia, commonly known as silverleaf chenopod, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features small, silver-gray, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, reflective hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in compact clusters, typical of the Chenopodiaceae family. It is well adapted to poor soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a common species in desert and coastal areas. Its succulent leaves and drought tolerance make it an important component of xerophytic ecosystems."
