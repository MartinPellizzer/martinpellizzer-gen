    "intro": "Acacia obovata var. minor, commonly known as the small-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia obovata var. minor is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and parts of South Africa. This variant thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in savanna and shrubland ecosystems. It is well adapted to dry conditions and can withstand periods of drought. The plant is often seen growing in open woodlands and along the edges of grasslands. Its distribution is closely linked to the specific environmental conditions of these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia obovata var. minor was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in the Western Cape and parts of the Eastern Cape, growing in sandy soils and along coastal areas. This plant is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature. Its introduction has led to some ecological concerns as it can compete with native vegetation in invaded areas. Despite its ornamental value, management strategies are needed to control its spread in sensitive ecosystems."
