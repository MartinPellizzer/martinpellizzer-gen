    "intro": "Avena pratensis subsp. bromoides, commonly known as meadow oat, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and spikelet-bearing inflorescences, which typically consist of small, bristle-like awns. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and is often found in moist meadows and along stream banks. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and is an important forage plant for livestock. The subspecies bromoides is distinguished by its more robust growth and the presence of longer awns compared to other Avena species."
