    "intro": "Arthraxon hispidus var. vriesii, commonly known as the hairy arthraxon, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
