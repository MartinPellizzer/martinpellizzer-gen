    "intro": "Asclepias lindleyi, commonly known as the Lindley's milkweed, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apocynaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Its milky sap contains latex, which is characteristic of the milkweed genus. Asclepias lindleyi plays an important ecological role, particularly as a host plant for the monarch butterfly."
