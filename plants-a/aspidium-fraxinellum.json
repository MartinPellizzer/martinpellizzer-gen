    "intro": "Aspidium fraxinellum, commonly known as the European water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help it spread across the substrate. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium fraxinellum is often found in slow-moving streams, ponds, and wetlands across Europe and parts of Asia."
