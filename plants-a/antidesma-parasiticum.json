    "intro": "Antidesma parasiticum, commonly known as the parasitic antidesma, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It derives some of its nutrients from host plants through specialized root structures called haustoria. The plant typically grows as a shrub or vine, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually opposite and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The flowers are small and clustered, often greenish or yellowish in color, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by animals."
