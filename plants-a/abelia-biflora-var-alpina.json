    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelia biflora var. alpina is primarily native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, specifically China, Korea, and Japan. This variant thrives in cool, moist climates at higher elevations. It is commonly found in forested areas and rocky slopes where the soil is well-drained. The plant prefers partial to full shade and is often associated with temperate coniferous forests. Its natural range is limited to these specific geographic locations, making it a rare and specialized species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia biflora var. alpina was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. This plant is valued for its fragrant flowers and adaptability to various soil types. It has been used in both ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects. However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid spread."
