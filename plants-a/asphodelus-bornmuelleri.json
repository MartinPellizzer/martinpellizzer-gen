It typically grows in rocky or dry soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded conditions. The plant produces tall, slender stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of yellow or greenish-yellow flowers. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like arrangements of small, tubular flowers. Asphodelus bornmuelleri is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
