    "intro": "Arachis lignosa, commonly known as the woody peanut, is a shrub native to South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellow flowers. The plant produces pods containing edible seeds, similar to other peanuts, though it is less commonly cultivated for food. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Arachis lignosa is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
