    "intro": "Artemisia stolonifera, commonly known as silver wormwood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, hair-like trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in compact clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Artemisia stolonifera spreads via stolons, allowing it to form dense mats or colonies in well-drained soils. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant in gardens."
