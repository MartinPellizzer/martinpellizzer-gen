    "intro": "Afrocarpus mannii subsp. dawei, commonly known as the African yellowwood, is a deciduous tree native to eastern and southern Africa. It belongs to the Podocarpaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark brown bark and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
