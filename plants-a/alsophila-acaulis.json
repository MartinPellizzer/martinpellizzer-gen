    "intro": "Alsophila acaulis, commonly known as the tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in persistent, overlapping leaves. The plant has a rhizome that produces both roots and fronds, with the fronds emerging from the top of the trunk. Its leaves are typically pinnately divided and can grow quite large, contributing to its ornamental value. Alsophila acaulis plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
