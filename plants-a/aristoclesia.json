    "intro": "Aristoclesia, commonly known as the angel's trumpet, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow, orange, or red. They are native to South America, particularly Brazil, and are often cultivated for their ornamental value. Aristoclesia species are shrubs or small trees that can grow up to several meters in height. The leaves are usually alternate, simple, and have a velvety texture, while the flowers are borne in clusters and emit a strong, sweet fragrance."
