    "intro": "Allium kuschakewiczii, commonly known as the Kuschakewicz garlic, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the Allium genus, which includes various species of onions and garlic, and is characterized by its bulbous structure and grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale purple, blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments, making it a hardy species with unique ecological significance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
