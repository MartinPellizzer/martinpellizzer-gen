    "intro": "Armeria pungens var. intermedia, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features dense clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are gray-green in color, adapted to retain moisture in sandy, well-drained soils. It thrives in full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for coastal and xeriscaping gardens."
