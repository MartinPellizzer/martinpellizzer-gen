    "intro": "Artemisia calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. The plant features silver-gray foliage with narrow, aromatic leaves that contain volatile oils. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in composite inflorescences, typical of the Asteraceae family. Artemisia calcicola is often used in traditional medicine and has ecological value as a food source for certain wildlife species."
