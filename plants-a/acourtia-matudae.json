    "intro": "Acourtia matudae, commonly known as Matud's acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in the spring, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits. Acourtia matudae is a relatively rare species, and its conservation status is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution.",
