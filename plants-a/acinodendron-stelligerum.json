    "intro": "Acinodendron stelligerum, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in saline and brackish environments, making it well adapted to coastal and mangrove ecosystems. Its ability to tolerate saltwater makes it an important component of coastal vegetation. Acinodendron stelligerum plays a role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial organisms.",
