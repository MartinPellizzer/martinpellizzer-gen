    "intro": "Artemisia vulgaris var. foliosa, commonly known as the woolly mugwort, is a perennial herb native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray, fuzzy foliage and aromatic, often pungent scent. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a serrated margin, while its flowers are small and clustered in panicles. This variant is closely related to other members of the Artemisia genus and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
