    "intro": "Angelonia viscosa, commonly known as sticky angelonia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that are typically pink, purple, or white. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Angelonia viscosa is often used in containers and as a border plant due to its long blooming season and drought tolerance."
