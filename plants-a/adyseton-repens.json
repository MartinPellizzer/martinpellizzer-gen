    "intro": "Adyseton repens, commonly known as creeping adyseton, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Adyseton repens thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it an effective ground cover in suitable habitats."
