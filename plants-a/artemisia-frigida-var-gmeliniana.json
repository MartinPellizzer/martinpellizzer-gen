It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in prairie and steppe ecosystems. Artemisia frigida var. gmeliniana plays an important role in preventing soil erosion and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
