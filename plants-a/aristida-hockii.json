    "intro": "Aristida hockii, commonly known as Hock's threeawn, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences composed of bristly spikelets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, with a rough texture that aids in water conservation. Aristida hockii is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in arid conditions."
