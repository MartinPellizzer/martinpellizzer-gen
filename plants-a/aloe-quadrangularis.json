    "intro": "Aloe quadrangularis, commonly known as the African aloe or the tree aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy, four-sided stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers at the top of the stems, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, often covered in a layer of white powder called farina. Aloe quadrangularis is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems and leaves to survive in dry conditions."
