    "intro": "Adina spathellifera, commonly known as the golden sand mat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers, which bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots allow it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Adina spathellifera is often used in xeriscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.",
