    "intro": "Arrhenatherum erianthum, commonly known as the soft fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, soft foliage and slender, erect flowering stems that bear small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along streambanks. Its leaves are narrow and have a slightly hairy texture, while the seeds are small and wind-dispersed. Arrhenatherum erianthum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
