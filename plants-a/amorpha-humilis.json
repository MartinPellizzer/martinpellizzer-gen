    "intro": "Amorpha humilis, commonly known as the downy bush clover, is a low-growing perennial legume native to the eastern United States. It features slender, often prostrate stems that bear small, yellow flowers clustered in racemes. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with numerous small, oval leaflets. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides. Amorpha humilis is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
