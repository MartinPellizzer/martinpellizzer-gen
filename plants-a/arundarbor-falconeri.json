It is characterized by its vibrant orange to red tubular flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. The plant has small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry soils. Arundarbor falconeri is well adapted to extreme temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
