    "intro": "Asplenium lademannianum, commonly known as the Lademann's spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant, typically found growing on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth form with finely divided, serrated leaves that are usually dark green. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many fern species. Asplenium lademannianum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich substrates."
