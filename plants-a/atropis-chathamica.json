    "intro": "Atropis chathamica, commonly known as the Chatham Islands sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Chatham Islands of New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive blue to purple flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, dandelion-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in coastal environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
