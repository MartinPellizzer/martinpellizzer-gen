    "intro": "Angorkis monodon, commonly known as the giant sea fan, is a species of gorgonian coral found in tropical marine environments. It is characterized by its branching, fan-like structure composed of calcium carbonate, which provides structural support. The plant features vibrant colors, often appearing in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which help in attracting symbiotic algae. It thrives in shallow, warm waters with good light penetration. Angorkis monodon plays a vital role in reef ecosystems by offering habitat and shelter to various marine organisms."
