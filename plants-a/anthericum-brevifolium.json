    "intro": "Anthericum brevifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved lily of the wall, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically shorter than the flowering stems. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in a loose panicle, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in damp, temperate habitats."
