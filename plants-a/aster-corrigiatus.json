    "intro": "Aster corrigiatus, commonly known as the white wood aster, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist woodlands and meadows, reaching heights of up to 2 feet. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers consist of white ray florets surrounding yellow disk florets. Aster corrigiatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
