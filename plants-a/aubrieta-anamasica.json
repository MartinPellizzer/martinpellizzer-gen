    "intro": "Aubrieta anamasica, commonly known as the Anamaza aubrieta, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in Peru. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is a low-growing perennial with a mat-forming habit, often found in rocky or gravelly soils. The leaves are linear and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment."
