    "intro": "Allium columbianum, commonly known as the Columbia garlic, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant belongs to the Allium genus, which includes onions, garlic, and chives, and is known for its strong, pungent aroma. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or open habitats. The bulbs of Allium columbianum are edible and have a flavor similar to garlic, making it a valued plant in both culinary and ecological contexts."
