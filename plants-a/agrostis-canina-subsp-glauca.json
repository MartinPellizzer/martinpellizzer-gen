It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a single, elongated spike that bears small, spikelet-like flowers. Agrostis canina subsp. glauca is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
