    "intro": "Acer amplum subsp. catalpifolium, commonly known as the Catalpa-leaved maple, is a rare and distinctive subspecies native to parts of eastern Europe. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of the catalpa tree, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland areas or along streambanks. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and appear in clusters, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.",

This subspecies is found in regions that include parts of southern and central China. It typically grows in mountainous areas and forested regions within its native range. The plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these geographic areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer amplum subsp. catalpifolium was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories and along stream banks. This subspecies has been reported in Washington, Oregon, and northern California. It is often mistaken for the native catalpa species due to its similar leaf shape. Its introduction has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts on local flora."
