    "intro": "Artemisia petraea, commonly known as mountain wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and Middle East. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to rocky and sandy habitats. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves, have been used traditionally for their medicinal and aromatic properties. Artemisia petraea plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environments and is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal."
