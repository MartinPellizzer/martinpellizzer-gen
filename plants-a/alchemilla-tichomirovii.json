    "intro": "Alchemilla tichomirovii, commonly known as the Tichomirov's lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountain meadows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
