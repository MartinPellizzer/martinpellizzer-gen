    "intro": "Alsophila naumannii, commonly known as the Naumann's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, compound fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting its upright growth form. The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
