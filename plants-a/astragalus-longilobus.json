    "intro": "Astragalus longilobus, commonly known as the long-lobed milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and rocky slopes. The plant features compound leaves with elongated, lobed leaflets and produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers in late spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, contributing to its ecological resilience. Astragalus longilobus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
