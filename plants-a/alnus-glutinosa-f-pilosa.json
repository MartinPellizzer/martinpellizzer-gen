    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa f. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy alder, is a variant of the European alder characterized by its hairy foliage and bark. It is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has small, catkin-like flowers that appear in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds dispersed by wind. Its root system forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility. This species is valued for its adaptability and ecological benefits in riparian zones."
