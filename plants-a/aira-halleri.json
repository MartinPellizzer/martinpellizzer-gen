    "intro": "Aira halleri, commonly known as the lesser basketgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that bear narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Aira halleri is often found in disturbed habitats and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
