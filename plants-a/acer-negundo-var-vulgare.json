    "intro": "Acer negundo var. vulgare, commonly known as the box elder, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It belongs to the maple family (Aceraceae) and is characterized by its opposite, palmate leaves that resemble those of other maple species. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse its seeds. It is adaptable to various soil types and can thrive in urban environments due to its tolerance for pollution and compacted soil. Its rapid growth rate makes it a popular choice for ornamental and shade purposes.",
