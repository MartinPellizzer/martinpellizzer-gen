    "intro": "Actinea bigelowii, commonly known as the Bigelow's actinia, is a species of sea anemone found in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It belongs to the family Actiniidae and is characterized by its long, slender body and delicate, translucent tentacles. This marine organism typically inhabits rocky substrates in intertidal zones, where it can anchor itself using its pedal disc. Actinea bigelowii plays a role in the marine ecosystem by serving as both predator and prey. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it an interesting subject for marine biological study.",
