    "intro": "Alnus \u00d7 spuria subsp. beckii, commonly known as the European alder, is a hybrid species within the genus Alnus, characterized by its rapid growth and adaptability to various soil conditions. It is a deciduous tree or shrub that typically reaches heights of 5 to 15 meters, featuring smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for wildlife. Its ecological importance makes it a valuable species in reforestation and wetland restoration projects."
