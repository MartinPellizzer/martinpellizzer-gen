It is characterized by its large, pinnately divided leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is valued for both its ornamental beauty and ecological role in its native habitats."
