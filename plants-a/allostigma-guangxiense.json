    "intro": "Allostigma guangxiense, commonly known as the Guangxi allostigma, is a rare flowering plant native to the Guangxi region of southern China. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers with white petals and yellow stamens. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as under forest canopies. Its leaves are ovate and have a smooth texture, while its stems are slender and often covered in fine hairs. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
