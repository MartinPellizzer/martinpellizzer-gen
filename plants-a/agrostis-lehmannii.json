It is a low-growing perennial grass that typically forms dense, mat-like vegetation. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover in suitable climates."
