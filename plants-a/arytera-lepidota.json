    "intro": "Arytera lepidota, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a soft texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming during the warmer months. It is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Arytera lepidota is also known for its role as a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
