    "intro": "Archangelica songarica, commonly known as the Siberian angelica, is a perennial herb native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Russia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and dill, and is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, umbrella-shaped compound leaves. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Archangelica songarica is valued both for its ecological role and its historical use in herbal remedies."
