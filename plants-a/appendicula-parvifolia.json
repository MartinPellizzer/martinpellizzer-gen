    "intro": "Appendicula parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved appendicula, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often clustered in umbels. Its leaves are narrow and lanceolate, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Appendicula parvifolia is often found in rocky or shaded areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
