    "intro": "Althaea mareotica, commonly known as the Egyptian marshmallow, is a perennial herb native to the Nile Delta region of Egypt. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of pale pink to white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in moist, saline soils and is often found in wetlands and marshy areas. Its stems are covered in a soft, woolly layer, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous small seeds. Althaea mareotica has been historically used in traditional medicine for its mucilage-rich roots, which are believed to have soothing properties."
