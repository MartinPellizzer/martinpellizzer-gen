    "intro": "Alyssoides utriculata, commonly known as the bladderleaf or bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its unique, inflated seed pods. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun exposure. Its small, pea-like flowers are usually pink or purple, and it produces distinctive bladder-like structures that encase its seeds. Alyssoides utriculata is often found in coastal and mountainous regions, where it thrives in well-drained environments."
