    "intro": "Acacia hemiteles, commonly known as the slender acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are typically yellow or pale yellow, arranged in cylindrical spikes. Acacia hemiteles produces small, woody pods that contain seeds, and it is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging climates.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia hemiteles is primarily native to South Australia and Western Australia. This species is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these states. It thrives in sandy soils and is often seen along coastal areas and inland dunes. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climate conditions of the region. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is a characteristic feature of the native vegetation in these areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia hemiteles was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. The plant has since become naturalized in parts of the country, particularly in coastal and disturbed areas. Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to concerns about its potential to invade native ecosystems. Despite its benefits, management strategies are being developed to control its spread and minimize ecological impacts."
