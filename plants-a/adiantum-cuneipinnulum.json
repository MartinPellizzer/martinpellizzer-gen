    "intro": "Adiantum cuneipinnulum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing clusters called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in shady, moist environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for shaded garden areas and indoor cultivation.",
