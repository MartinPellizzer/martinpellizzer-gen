    "intro": "Avena filifolia subsp. velutina, commonly known as velvet oat, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, silky hairs that give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Velvet oat is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
