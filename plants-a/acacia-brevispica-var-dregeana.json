It is found in the Eastern Cape Province, particularly in the region around the Sundays River. This variant thrives in sandy soils and is commonly associated with coastal and inland grassland habitats. It is a shrub or small tree that plays an important role in local ecosystems. The plant is well adapted to the semi-arid climate of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia brevispica var. dregeana was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces, thriving in coastal and semi-arid environments. This variety is often associated with rocky soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and disturbed habitats. However, it is not considered invasive and is primarily valued for its ornamental and ecological roles."
