    "intro": "Alantsilodendron brevipes, commonly known as the short-footed flame tree, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy, orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. The plant has a short, sturdy trunk and broad, palm-like leaves that provide dense shade. Its rapid growth rate makes it popular for ornamental purposes in warm climates. However, it requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive."
