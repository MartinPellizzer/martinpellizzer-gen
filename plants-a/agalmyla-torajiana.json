    "intro": "Agalmyla torajiana, commonly known as the Toraja agalmyla, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of Indonesia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant has hairy leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in its native environment. It thrives in shaded, humid conditions and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
