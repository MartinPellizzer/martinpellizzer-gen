    "intro": "Aquilegia borodinii, commonly known as Borodin's columbine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking, spurred flowers that range in color from deep violet to crimson, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmately divided leaves with a rough texture and a distinctive, fragrant scent. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
