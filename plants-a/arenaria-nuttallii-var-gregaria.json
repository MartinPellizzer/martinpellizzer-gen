    "intro": "Arenaria nuttallii var. gregaria, commonly known as the clustered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It typically forms dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has thin, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as dunes or rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh, dry conditions."
