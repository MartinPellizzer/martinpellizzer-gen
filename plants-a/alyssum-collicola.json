    "intro": "Alyssum collicola, commonly known as the rock allyssum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Alyssum collicola is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in rocky landscapes."
