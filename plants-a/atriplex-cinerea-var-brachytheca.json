It is characterized by its gray-green, fuzzy foliage and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils and withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine by indigenous peoples for their purported healing properties. This species plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
