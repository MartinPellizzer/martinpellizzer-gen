    "intro": "Alafia berrieri, commonly known as the St. Croix cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the island of St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands. It is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, trunk-like stem and large, feather-like leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and it produces cones for reproduction. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from development and environmental changes, Alafia berrieri is listed as endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
