    "intro": "Athyrium angustum var. boreale, commonly known as the narrow fern, is a variant of the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern. It is characterized by its slender, dark green fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant has a delicate, lace-like appearance with finely divided pinnae that give it a delicate, airy look. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate forest understories. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light."
