    "intro": "Acantholimon minshelkense, commonly known as the Minshelkene thornweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.",

It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the country, particularly in the southern and central parts. This plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along riverbanks and in steppe landscapes. It is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within Kazakhstan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon minshelkense was mainly introduced to areas with dry, rocky soils and arid climates, particularly in regions of the Mediterranean Basin. It is commonly found in open habitats such as slopes, cliffs, and disturbed ground. This plant has been documented in several countries including Spain, Portugal, and parts of southern France. Its introduction is often associated with human activities, such as road construction and gardening. Due to its hardy nature, it can sometimes become invasive in non-native environments."
