    "intro": "Avena flexuosa, commonly known as bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, creeping habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Avena flexuosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat for various organisms."
