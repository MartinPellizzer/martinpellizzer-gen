    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon molle var. grandifolium is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Texas. This plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is commonly associated with desert and semi-desert environments. It thrives in areas with full sun and is often seen along roadsides and in disturbed habitats. Its native range includes the Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon molle var. grandifolium was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive, fuzzy leaves and showy yellow flowers. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and stream banks. It has become naturalized in some parts of its introduced range, posing a potential threat to native plant communities. Its distribution is now primarily limited to areas with suitable climate and soil conditions."
