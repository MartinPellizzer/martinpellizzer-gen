    "intro": "Agave papyrocarpa subsp. macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant cardon cactus, is a species native to the Canary Islands. It is a large, columnar cactus characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and spiny areoles. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that emerge from the axils of the leaves. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. This subspecies is notable for its slow growth and can live for several decades, making it a striking feature of its native habitat."
