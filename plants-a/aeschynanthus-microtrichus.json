    "intro": "Aeschynanthus microtrichus, commonly known as the dwarf ivy or miniature ivy, is a species of flowering plant in the family Gesneriaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. This plant is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, velvety leaves that are often covered with fine, hair-like structures. It produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically bright red or orange, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Aeschynanthus microtrichus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and attractive foliage."
