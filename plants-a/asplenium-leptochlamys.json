    "intro": "Asplenium leptochlamys, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found growing in forests or along stream banks. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium leptochlamys is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in controlled indoor conditions."
