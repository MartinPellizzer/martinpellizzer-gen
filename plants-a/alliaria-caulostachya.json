    "intro": "Alliaria caulostachya, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features smooth, dark green leaves that are heart-shaped and emit a garlic-like odor when crushed. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by kidney-shaped seed pods. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native plant species and disrupt local ecosystems."
