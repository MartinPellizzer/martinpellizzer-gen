It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like appearance with slender stems and small, clustered inflorescences. The flowers are typically yellow or greenish, and the plant produces small, three-lobed seeds. Anisomallon species are often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. These plants are generally short-lived and have a limited geographic distribution."
