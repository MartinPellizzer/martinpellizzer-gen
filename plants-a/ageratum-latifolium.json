    "intro": "Ageratum latifolium, commonly known as broadleaf ageratum, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its bushy growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of purple, blue, and white. The plant has large, velvety leaves that are typically gray-green in color, providing a striking contrast to its colorful blooms. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal. Ageratum latifolium is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it a popular choice for gardeners in warmer climates."
