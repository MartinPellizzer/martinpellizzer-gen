    "intro": "Amorpha californica var. hispidula, commonly known as the California burro's tail, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and its unique, cylindrical, spiny seed pods that resemble small, twisted tails. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in racemes along the stems. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. This variety is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy plant in arid environments."
