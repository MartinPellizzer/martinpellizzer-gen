    "intro": "Ajania, commonly known as the blue poppy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Papaveraceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly the Himalayas and Central Asia. The plants are characterized by their striking blue or violet flowers, which bloom in spring. Ajania species typically have basal leaves that are palmately lobed, and they often grow in rocky or alpine environments. Due to their ornamental value, some species are cultivated in gardens, though they are generally hardy and require well-drained soil."
