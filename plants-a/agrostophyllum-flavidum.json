It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish flowers.

Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slight sheen, and it produces inflorescences that are clustered at the tips of the stems. Agrostophyllum flavidum is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and ecological role in its native environment."
