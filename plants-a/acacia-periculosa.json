    "intro": "Acacia periculosa, commonly known as the death's-head hawkmoth acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish-green leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are arranged in dense, globular clusters. Its seed pods are elongated and contain hard, angular seeds. Acacia periculosa is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia periculosa is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is commonly found in savannas and shrublands. This species is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat, including high temperatures and low rainfall. It plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species. Due to its resilience, it is often used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia periculosa was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and stabilize degraded lands in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly used in reforestation projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is also valued for its hardy nature and capacity to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility. However, its rapid spread has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in some ecosystems. Despite its benefits, careful management is required to prevent unintended ecological impacts."
