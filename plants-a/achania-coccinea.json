    "intro": "Achania coccinea, commonly known as the red-stemmed bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, reddish stems that are often tinged with purple, and its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tubular, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to deep red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Achania coccinea prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable addition to wetland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant floral display and ability to thrive in humid environments.",
