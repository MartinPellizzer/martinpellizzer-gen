    "intro": "Aster subcaudatus, commonly known as the western aster, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and often branched. Aster subcaudatus plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies during its flowering period."
