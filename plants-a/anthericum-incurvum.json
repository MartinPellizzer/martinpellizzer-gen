    "intro": "Anthericum incurvum, commonly known as the curly fern, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its distinctive, curling fronds that give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Anthericum incurvum prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and can be grown in containers or as part of a shaded garden."
