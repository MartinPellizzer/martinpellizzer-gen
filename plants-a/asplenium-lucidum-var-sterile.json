    "intro": "Asplenium lucidum var. sterile, commonly known as the sterile shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, leathery leaves that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. Unlike the fertile form, this variant does not produce spores, making it a sterile morphological variant. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique appearance and lack of reproductive capability make it a distinctive addition to botanical collections."
