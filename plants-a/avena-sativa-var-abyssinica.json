    "intro": "Avena sativa var. abyssinica, commonly known as Abyssinian oat, is a variant of the common oat that is native to Ethiopia. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its seeds, which are rich in nutrients, are used for both human consumption and animal feed. This variety is adapted to grow in arid and semi-arid environments, making it an important crop in regions with limited water resources."
