    "intro": "Alchemilla chirophylla subsp. exilis, commonly known as the slender alchemilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its compact appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry, sunny conditions."
