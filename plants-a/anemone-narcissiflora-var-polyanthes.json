    "intro": "Anemone narcissiflora var. polyanthes, commonly known as the garden anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has basal leaves that are palmately divided, with a hairy texture, and grows to a height of about 12 to 24 inches. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its botanical structure supports its role as a nectar source for pollinators and a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
