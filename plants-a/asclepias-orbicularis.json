    "intro": "Asclepias orbicularis, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its orbicular, or round, leaves and clusters of pink to purple flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. It plays a crucial role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing a host for their larvae. Asclepias orbicularis thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species in arid environments."
