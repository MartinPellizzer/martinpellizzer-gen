It belongs to the family Cymaraceae and is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped inflorescence. The plant has a short, branched stem with small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its saline environment. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species, requiring conservation efforts to protect its fragile ecosystem."
