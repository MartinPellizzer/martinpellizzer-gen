    "intro": "Ampelocissus phoenicantha, commonly known as the red-leafed climbing fig, is a woody vine native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, red-tinged stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sun. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and greenhouses."
