    "intro": "Apium lobatum, commonly known as scorzonera, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a taproot that is often harvested for its edible, slightly spicy flavor. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in umbels. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Apium lobatum is valued both for its culinary use and its role in traditional herbal medicine."
