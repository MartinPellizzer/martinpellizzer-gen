    "intro": "Astragalus brachystachys, commonly known as the short-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant produces small, legume-like pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and sagebrush habitats. Astragalus brachystachys plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
