    "intro": "Acantholimon bracteatum var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate thimbleweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert habitats.",

It is commonly found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with maritime climates. It is also present in parts of Baja California, Mexico. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones with mild, wet winters and dry summers.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon bracteatum var. intermedium was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It is commonly found in coastal and inland regions where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. This plant is often associated with disturbed sites such as roadsides, dunes, and agricultural fields. Its introduction has led to its establishment in areas where it can outcompete native vegetation. Due to its adaptability, it has become a common sight in many parts of its introduced range."
