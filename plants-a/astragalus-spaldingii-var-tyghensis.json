    "intro": "Astragalus spaldingii var. tyghensis, commonly known as Tygh Valley milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and open woodlands. It has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
