    "intro": "Adina sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf adina, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are typically sessile, meaning they lack a petiole and are directly attached to the stem. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Adina sessilifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local medicine.",
