    "intro": "Aspidopterys nutans var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leafed aspidopterys, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, rounded leaves that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
