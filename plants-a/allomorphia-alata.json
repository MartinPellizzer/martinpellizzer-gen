    "intro": "Allomorphia alata, commonly known as the winged fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with wing-like structures along the leaf margins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spores are borne on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
