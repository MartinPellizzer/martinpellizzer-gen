    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abarema teysmannii is primarily native to the Amazon Basin, particularly in regions of Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. It is commonly found in lowland tropical rainforests where the climate is humid and warm year-round. This species thrives in shaded understory environments, often growing along riverbanks and in secondary forest regrowth areas. Its native distribution includes parts of Ecuador and Bolivia as well. Abarema teysmannii is an important component of the biodiversity in these regions, contributing to the ecological balance of the rainforest ecosystem.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema teysmannii was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and fallow fields. The plant has been reported in several countries in South America, including Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. It is often used as a forage plant due to its high nutritional value for livestock. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in some regions."
