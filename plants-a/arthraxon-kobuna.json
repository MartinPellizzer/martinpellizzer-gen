    "intro": "Arthraxon kobuna, commonly known as the Japanese arrowgrass, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, preferring moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often reddish in color. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in loose spikes, and it produces small, three-lobed seeds. Arthraxon kobuna is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
