    "intro": "Apodanthera ulei, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed species known for their milky sap. The plant typically grows as a low, sprawling shrub with narrow, gray-green leaves and small, clustered flowers that range from white to pale pink. Its fibrous roots help it survive in dry conditions by storing water and nutrients. Apodanthera ulei plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though it is not as widely cultivated as other milkweed species."
