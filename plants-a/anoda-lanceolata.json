It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in open woodlands and rocky soils. Anoda lanceolata is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
