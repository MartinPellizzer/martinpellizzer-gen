    "intro": "Agrostis tenuis var. repens, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its fine, narrow leaves and compact inflorescences. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common component of grassland vegetation. Botanically, it is distinguished by its small, spike-like flower clusters and its ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions."
