    "intro": "Alnus \u00d7 elliptica, commonly known as the hybrid alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree that exhibits characteristics of both alders and other related species. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 8 meters, featuring lanceolate to elliptic leaves that are often dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by woody cone-like fruits that release seeds when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or near water sources. Alnus \u00d7 elliptica is valued for its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
