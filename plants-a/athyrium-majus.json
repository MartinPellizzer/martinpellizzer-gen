    "intro": "Athyrium majus, commonly known as the giant lady fern, is a striking fern species native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its large, lush fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters, making it one of the tallest ferns in its native range. The plant features a bipinnate leaf structure, with finely divided, arching segments that give it a graceful appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing the plant to store moisture and nutrients for extended periods."
