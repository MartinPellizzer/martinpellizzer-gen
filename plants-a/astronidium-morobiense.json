    "intro": "Astronidium morobiense, commonly known as the Morob Island starwood, is a rare tropical tree native to the island of Morob in Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered white flowers that bloom throughout the year. Its fruits are small berries that turn red when mature, attracting various bird species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Astronidium morobiense is considered a critically endangered species."
