    "intro": "Arctostaphylos uva-ursi f. suborbiculata, commonly known as the suborbiculate bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features small, leathery leaves that are oval to suborbiculate in shape, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, urn-shaped flowers that develop into red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. This subspecies is notable for its aromatic foliage and is adapted to harsh, cold climates."
