It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, fluffy white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Ageratina rufa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
