    "intro": "Astragalus meschhedensis, commonly known as the Mesopotamian milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Middle East. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to poor soil conditions. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Astragalus meschhedensis is also noted for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its therapeutic uses."
