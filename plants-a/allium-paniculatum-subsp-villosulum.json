It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces a tall, leafless flowering stem topped with a loose, branched inflorescence of small, white to pale purple flowers. Its bulbs are typically small and clustered, and the plant is often grown for its ornamental value in gardens. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders."
