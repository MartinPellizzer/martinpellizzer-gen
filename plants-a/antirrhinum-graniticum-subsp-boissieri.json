    "intro": "Antirrhinum graniticum subsp. boissieri, commonly known as the granitic snapdragon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the rocky and arid regions of the Mediterranean. It features slender, branching stems that often grow along the ground, and its leaves are narrow and pointed, typically covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces striking, two-lipped flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
