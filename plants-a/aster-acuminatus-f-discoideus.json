    "intro": "Aster acuminatus f. discoideus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved aster, is a variant of the aster species characterized by its distinctive, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. This plant is native to the western United States, particularly in regions with dry, rocky soils. Its flowering stems are usually unbranched, bearing small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the late summer and early fall. The foliage is often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. It is a perennial plant that thrives in full sun and is often found in meadows and open woodlands."
