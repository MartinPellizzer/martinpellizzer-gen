    "intro": "Arabis eriopoda, commonly known as the woolly rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine environments. Arabis eriopoda is adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
