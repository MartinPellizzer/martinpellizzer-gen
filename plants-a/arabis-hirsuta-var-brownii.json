    "intro": "Arabis hirsuta var. brownii, commonly known as the Brown's hairy rockcress, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its compact growth habit and low maintenance make it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. The species is noted for its frost resistance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
