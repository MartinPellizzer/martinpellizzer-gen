    "intro": "Aphelandra arnoldii, commonly known as the golden flame plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves that are often a deep green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces vibrant yellow-orange bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Aphelandra arnoldii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
