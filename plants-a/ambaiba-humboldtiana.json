    "intro": "Ambaiba humboldtiana, commonly known as the Humboldt's ambaiba, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in sandy soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in the salty, humid conditions of coastal environments. Its leaves are palmate, with five to seven lobes, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. Ambaiba humboldtiana is often found in association with other coastal flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
