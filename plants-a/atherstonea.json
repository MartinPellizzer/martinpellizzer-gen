    "intro": "Atherstonea, commonly known as the golden moss, is a genus of mosses belonging to the family Atherstoneaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, leafy structures and are typically found in moist, shaded environments. Atherstonea species are often epiphytic, growing on the surfaces of trees or rocks rather than in soil. Their small, intricate morphology makes them important indicators of environmental conditions. Due to their specialized habitat requirements, they are relatively rare and often overlooked in ecological studies."
