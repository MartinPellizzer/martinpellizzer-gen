It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and smooth. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or on rocky slopes. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
