    "intro": "Asimina insularis, commonly known as the Florida yellow custard apple, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, yellow to orange fruits that are edible but have a strong, custard-like flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. Asimina insularis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
