    "intro": "Adipera santanderensis, commonly known as the Santander spider-orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance with long, slender petals and a distinctive floral structure. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.",
