    "intro": "Azorella hookeri, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is native to the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing cushions of foliage that help it survive in high-altitude, cold environments. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that are tightly packed to reduce water loss and withstand strong winds. It produces white or yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in umbels typical of its family. Azorella hookeri is adapted to harsh conditions, making it a hardy and resilient species found in alpine and subarctic regions."
