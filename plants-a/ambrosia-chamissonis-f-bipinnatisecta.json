    "intro": "Ambrosia chamissonis f. bipinnatisecta, commonly known as the bipinnatisect ambrosia, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, bipinnatisected leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its allergenic properties, it is considered a weed in some regions."
