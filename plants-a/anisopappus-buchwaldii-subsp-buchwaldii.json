    "intro": "Anisopappus buchwaldii subsp. buchwaldii, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has linear, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, helping it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces small, papery bracts beneath its flower heads, which are distinctive in appearance. This species is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
