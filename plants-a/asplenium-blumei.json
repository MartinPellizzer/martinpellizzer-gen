    "intro": "Asplenium blumei, commonly known as the Blume's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has slender, dark green fronds that are usually less than 20 centimeters in length. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns. Asplenium blumei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
