It is characterized by its delicate, translucent tentacles that give it a shimmering appearance. The polyp's body is typically pale or silver in color, which contributes to its common name. It thrives in shallow, coastal waters and is often found in association with coral reefs. This species plays an important role in marine ecosystems as both predator and prey.",
