It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid, rocky habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its simple structure and delicate blooms make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
