    "intro": "Alepyrum pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf pumice grass, is a small perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
