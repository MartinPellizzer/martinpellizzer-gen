    "intro": "Aster radicans, commonly known as the spreading aster, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features a sprawling growth habit with multiple stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread aggressively. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, typically blooming in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Aster radicans thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges."
