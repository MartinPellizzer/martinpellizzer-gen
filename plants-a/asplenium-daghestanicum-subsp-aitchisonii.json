    "intro": "Asplenium daghestanicum subsp. aitchisonii, commonly known as the Aitchison's maidenhair fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly glossy texture. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
