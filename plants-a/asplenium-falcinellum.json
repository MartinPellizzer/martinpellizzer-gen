    "intro": "Asplenium falcinellum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping, allowing it to form dense mats in its natural habitat. Asplenium falcinellum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
