    "intro": "Agropyron repens var. geniculatum, commonly known as the bentgrass or meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, and its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets. This variety is often found in moist, temperate environments, such as meadows and lawns. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant is adapted to withstand moderate grazing and is sometimes used in turfgrass mixtures."
