    "intro": "Agrostis decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is a small, tufted perennial grass that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and small, spikelet-based flowers that appear in late summer. It is often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Due to its ability to thrive in wet conditions, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
