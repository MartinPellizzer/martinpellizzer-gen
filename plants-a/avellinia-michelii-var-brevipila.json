    "intro": "Avellinia michelii var. brevipila, commonly known as the short-bracted hazelnut, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and clustered, nut-like fruits. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils. Its flowers are inconspicuous, and the fruits are enclosed in a cupule, which becomes woody as they mature. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
