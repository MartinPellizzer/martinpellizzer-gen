    "intro": "Arctostaphylos uva-ursi var. saxicola, commonly known as the saxicola bearberry, is a low-growing shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of North America. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically evergreen, and it produces red or pinkish flowers in the spring. The plant is adapted to harsh, rocky environments and has a deep root system to access moisture. Its berries are edible for some wildlife but contain compounds that can be toxic to humans in large quantities. This variety is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth compared to other bearberry species."
