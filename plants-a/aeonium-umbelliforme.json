    "intro": "Aeonium umbelliforme, commonly known as the Umbrella Aeonium, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features rosettes of fleshy, bluish-green leaves that form a compact, umbrella-like shape. The plant produces tall, branching stems with clusters of yellow flowers during the growing season. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with ample sunlight. Aeonium umbelliforme is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its ornamental appearance and low maintenance requirements."
