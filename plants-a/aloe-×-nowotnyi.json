    "intro": "Aloe \u00d7 nowotnyi, commonly known as the hybrid aloe, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Aloe vera and Aloe arborescens. It is characterized by its tall, branched stem and large, fleshy, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters at the top of the stem, which are attractive to pollinators. It is native to South Africa and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties. Aloe \u00d7 nowotnyi is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping."
