    "intro": "Anoectochilus lobbianus, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine pubescence. The plant produces small, pale yellow or greenish flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
