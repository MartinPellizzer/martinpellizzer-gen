    "intro": "Agave atrovirens var. latissima, commonly known as the broadleaf agave, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are broader than those of most other agave species, often reaching widths of up to 30 centimeters. The leaves are typically blue-gray in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces a tall flowering stalk with yellowish-green flowers, though it rarely blooms in cultivation. This variety is valued for its striking appearance and adaptability to dry climates."
