    "intro": "Abutilon eggersii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, characterized by its fuzzy, gray-green leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The flowers are usually yellow or orange and bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. The plant is also known for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon eggersii is primarily native to the Andes Mountains of South America, specifically in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. It thrives in high-altitude regions with a temperate climate and well-drained soils. This species is commonly found in cloud forests and rocky slopes at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters. It is adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its native habitat. Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon eggersii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and adaptability. It was brought there during the 19th century by European settlers who admired its fuzzy leaves and showy flowers. Although it was initially cultivated for its aesthetic value, it has since become an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in disturbed habitats and can spread rapidly through seeds dispersed by wind and water. Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native plant species."
