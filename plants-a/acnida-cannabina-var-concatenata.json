    "intro": "Acnida cannabina var. concatenata, commonly known as the horned hemp or horned cannabis, is a variant of the genus Acnida within the Cannabaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like structures on its stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant is native to parts of Africa and is often found in moist, shaded environments. It has small, opposite leaves and produces greenish-white flowers. Due to its close relation to Cannabis sativa, it has been the subject of botanical and pharmacological interest.",
