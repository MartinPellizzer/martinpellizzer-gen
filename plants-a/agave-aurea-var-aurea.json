    "intro": "Agave aurea var. aurea, commonly known as the golden agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color with a yellowish tinge. The leaves are lined with sharp spines and have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces a tall flowering stalk that bears yellow flowers, which appear in the spring. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
