    "intro": "Astragalus linifolius, commonly known as the silky milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are finely divided and covered in soft, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss. Astragalus linifolius is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
