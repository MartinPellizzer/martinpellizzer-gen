    "intro": "Amsonia biformis, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking blue-gray foliage and fluffy, lavender-blue flower heads that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Its showy blooms attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native gardens. Amsonia biformis is drought-tolerant once established and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
