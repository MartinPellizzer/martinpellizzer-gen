    "intro": "Amorphophallus krausei, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking tropical plant native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can span several feet in diameter, which float on the surface of still water. The plant's most notable feature is its massive, spadix-like inflorescence, which can grow up to 10 feet tall and is often associated with its strong, unpleasant odor. Its botanical structure includes a rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in aquatic environments. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by providing shelter and food for various aquatic organisms."
