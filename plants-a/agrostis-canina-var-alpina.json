    "intro": "Agrostis canina var. alpina, commonly known as alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. This variety thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds."
