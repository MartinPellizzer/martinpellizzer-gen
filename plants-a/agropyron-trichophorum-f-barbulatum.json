    "intro": "Agropyron trichophorum f. barbulatum, commonly known as the hairy bluegrass, is a grass species characterized by its distinctive hairy foliage and compact growth habit. It is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute blue to purple flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its rhizomatous growth system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil health."
