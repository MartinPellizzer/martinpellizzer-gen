    "intro": "Asplenium prenticei, commonly known as the Prentice's spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, evergreen leaves that are typically narrow and strap-like in appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium prenticei is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or forest floors. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and relatively rare species within its native range."
