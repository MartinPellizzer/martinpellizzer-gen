    "intro": "Adelobotrys spruceanus, commonly known as the Sprucean mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on coniferous trees, primarily in the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Viscaceae and has a distinctive appearance with small, oval-shaped leaves and white, fleshy berries. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent. It plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects. Adelobotrys spruceanus is often found in temperate and subalpine regions where its host trees thrive.",
