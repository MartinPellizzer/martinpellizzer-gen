    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has bipinnate leaves composed of numerous tiny leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This variety is distinguished by its pale floral color, setting it apart from the more commonly seen red-flowered form of the species."
