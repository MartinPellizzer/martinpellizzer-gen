    "intro": "Ancistrocactus scheeri subsp. tobuschii, commonly known as the Tubb's ancistrocactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the arid regions of Texas and northern Mexico. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, woolly white hairs that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. It is well adapted to drought and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
