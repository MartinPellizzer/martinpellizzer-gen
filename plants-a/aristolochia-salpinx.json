    "intro": "Aristolochia salpinx, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Dutchman's pipe, is a perennial vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, maroon-colored flowers that resemble a pipe, which attract specific pollinators like wasps. The plant has heart-shaped, serrated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its stems are woody and can climb by twining around supports. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
