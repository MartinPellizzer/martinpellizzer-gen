    "intro": "Anacamptis laxiflora f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species characterized by its long, spiraled inflorescence. It features predominantly white flowers with subtle pink or greenish hues, distinguishing it from the typical greenish-yellow flowers of the species. The plant thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its floral structure includes three sepals and three petals, with the lateral petals forming a hood-like shape over the lip. This orchid is noted for its delicate appearance and is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution."
