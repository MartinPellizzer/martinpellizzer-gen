    "intro": "Abronia \u00d7 minor, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid landscapes.",

It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in disturbed or open habitats. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within California. Due to its hybrid nature, its exact native range can be difficult to define.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abronia \u00d7 minor was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained sandy soils and full sun exposure. It is commonly found in coastal dunes and disturbed habitats where it can thrive in harsh environmental conditions. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant flowers and compact growth habit. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions outside its native range. However, its spread is generally limited due to its specific ecological requirements."
