    "intro": "Anomacanthus drupaceus, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an endangered species in many regions."
