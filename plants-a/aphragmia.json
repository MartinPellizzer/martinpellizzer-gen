    "intro": "Aphragmia, commonly known as the marsh gentian, is a flowering plant belonging to the Gentianaceae family. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Aphragmia has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. It plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies in its native wetland environments."
