    "intro": "Alchemilla condensa, commonly known as narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender stems. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. Alchemilla condensa is often found in moist, shady habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
