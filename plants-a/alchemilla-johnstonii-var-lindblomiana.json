    "intro": "Alchemilla johnstonii var. lindblomiana, commonly known as the Lindblom's lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
