    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris f. colorata, commonly known as the variegated lady's mantle, is a decorative perennial plant native to Europe. It features striking, shield-shaped leaves with a distinctive variegation of white, yellow, and green, which add visual interest to gardens. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens or shaded borders. Its ornamental foliage is the primary attraction, though it also serves as a habitat for beneficial insects."
