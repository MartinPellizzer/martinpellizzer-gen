    "intro": "Avena pubescens var. amethystina, commonly known as purple oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It features slender, upright stems that are often tinged with a distinctive purple hue, especially under certain light conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, contributing to its characteristic pubescent appearance. This variety is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes."
