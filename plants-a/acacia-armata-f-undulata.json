    "intro": "Acacia armata f. undulata, commonly known as the undulating wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, yellow flowers that appear in dense clusters. The leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous tiny leaflets, and the plant produces long, slender pods that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This variety is notable for its unique, undulating growth pattern that gives it its common name.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia armata f. undulata is primarily native to southern Australia, including parts of New South Wales, South Australia, and Western Australia. This subspecies is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in sandy soils. It thrives in open woodlands and scrublands, often along riverbanks and in coastal areas. The plant is well adapted to drought and heat, making it a resilient component of the local flora. Its distribution is closely associated with specific soil types and climatic conditions typical of the southern Australian landscape.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia armata f. undulata was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has been cultivated for its ornamental value and hardiness. It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides due to its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid conditions. This plant is also used in reclamation projects because of its capacity to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. However, it has been identified as an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a popular choice for landscaping but also a potential ecological concern."
