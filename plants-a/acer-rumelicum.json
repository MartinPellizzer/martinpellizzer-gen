    "intro": "Acer rumelicum, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The tree has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that are typically green in summer and turn red, orange, or yellow in autumn. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring. Acer rumelicum prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas along rivers and streams.",
