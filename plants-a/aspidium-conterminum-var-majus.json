    "intro": "Aspidium conterminum var. majus, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, broad, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorus on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered and covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found near streams, ponds, or in damp forest floors. This variant is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant."
