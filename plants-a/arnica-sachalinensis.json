    "intro": "Arnica sachalinensis, commonly known as the Sakhalin arnica, is a flowering plant native to the Russian Far East and northeastern China. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, meadow-like habitats and is adapted to temperate climates. It has a short stem and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
