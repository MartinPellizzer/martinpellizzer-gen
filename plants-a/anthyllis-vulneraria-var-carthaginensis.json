    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria var. carthaginensis, commonly known as the Carthaginian milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink to violet. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
