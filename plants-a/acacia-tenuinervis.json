    "intro": "Acacia tenuinervis, commonly known as the narrow-veined acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often thornless stems and bipinnate leaves with fine, parallel veins. The plant produces yellow or pale yellow flowers in compact clusters, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Acacia tenuinervis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a potential source of medicinal or ecological value.",

This species thrives in open woodlands and grasslands with well-drained soils. It is often seen in the northeastern parts of Queensland, including areas near the coast and inland. Acacia tenuinervis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia tenuinervis was mainly introduced to regions with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It has been widely planted for its ability to stabilize soils and provide forage for livestock. The plant is also valued for its hardy nature and capacity to withstand drought conditions. However, its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species. It is commonly found in parts of Australia, Africa, and the Middle East where it has been intentionally introduced for agricultural and environmental purposes."
