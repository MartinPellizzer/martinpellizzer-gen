    "intro": "Asplenium trichomanes nothosubsp. malacitense, commonly known as the Malacitense spleenwort, is a fern species belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its small, evergreen, and densely packed fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. This nothosubspecies is likely a hybrid or variant of the broader A. trichomanes species, exhibiting slight morphological differences."
