    "intro": "Aloe tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a dense, woolly layer of white to grayish hairs. The leaves are typically narrow and upright, forming a rosette shape that helps the plant conserve water. It produces yellowish-green flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, often during the summer months. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
