    "intro": "Anagallis arvensis f. pallida, commonly known as the pale willow herb, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Primulaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and small, pale pink to white flowers. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and the plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas. This variety is distinguished by its reduced floral pigmentation compared to the typical form of Anagallis arvensis."
