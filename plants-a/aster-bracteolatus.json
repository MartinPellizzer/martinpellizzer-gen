    "intro": "Aster bracteolatus, commonly known as the bracteolate aster, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges, and it can reach heights of up to 2 feet. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the bracts beneath the flower heads are distinctive and often mistaken for petals. Aster bracteolatus plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies during the autumn season."
