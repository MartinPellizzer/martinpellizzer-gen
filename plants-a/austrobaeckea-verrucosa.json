    "intro": "Austrobaeckea verrucosa, commonly known as the rough-leaved ironwood, is a flowering plant native to southern South America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with a dense, rugged trunk and thick, leathery leaves. The leaves are typically dark green and have a rough, textured surface, giving the plant its common name. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits. This species is valued for its hard, heavy wood and is often found in dry, coastal areas."
