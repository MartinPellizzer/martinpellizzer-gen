    "intro": "Ananas erectifolius, commonly known as the upright-leaf pineapple, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many other bromeliads. The plant is characterized by its rosette of narrow, upright leaves that form a central cup, which can hold water. It produces a striking inflorescence with brightly colored flowers, typically red or orange, followed by a fruit that resembles a pineapple. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in warm, humid environments with bright indirect light."
