    "intro": "Asplenium rawsonii, commonly known as the Rawson's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to New Zealand. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in cool, moist environments. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. It produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Asplenium rawsonii is relatively uncommon and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche."
