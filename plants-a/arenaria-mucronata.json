    "intro": "Arenaria mucronata, commonly known as the sharp-tipped sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Arenaria mucronata plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and mountainous regions."
