It features compound leaves with elongated, leathery leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences. The plant bears pods that contain several elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat."
