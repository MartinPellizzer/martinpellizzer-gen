It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important plants such as cabbage and mustard. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. Its foliage is characterized by narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs."
