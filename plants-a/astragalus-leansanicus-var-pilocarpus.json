    "intro": "Astragalus leansanicus var. pilocarpus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-white flowers clustered in globular heads. The plant has compound leaves with small, hairy leaflets, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. This species plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife."
