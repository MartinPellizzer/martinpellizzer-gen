    "intro": "Anopteris hexagona var. simplicior, commonly known as the Japanese male fern, is a fern species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a rough texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in botanical studies."
