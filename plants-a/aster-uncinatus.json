It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, purple-to-white ray florets and yellow disk flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its unique feature is the hooked bracts at the base of the flower head, which give it its common name. Aster uncinatus is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
