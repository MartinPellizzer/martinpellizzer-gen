    "intro": "Artemisia gigantea f. montana, commonly known as mountain wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray, aromatic foliage and branched stems that often grow in a sprawling or upright habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in loose panicles, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough texture and a strong, camphor-like scent. This variety is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and alpine environments."
