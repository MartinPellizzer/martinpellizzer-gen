    "intro": "Achillea eradiata, commonly known as yellow archangel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal rosettes of lance-shaped, bright green leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom from spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings.",
