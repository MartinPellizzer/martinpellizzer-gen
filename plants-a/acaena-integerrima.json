    "intro": "Acaena integerrima, commonly known as the New Zealand burr or bristly knapweed, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, spiny bracts that form a bur-like structure, which helps in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the development of its distinctive, prickly fruits. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. Acaena integerrima is often found in coastal and inland habitats, including forest margins and rocky areas.",

It thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and shrublands. Acaena integerrima is well adapted to the climate and soil conditions of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in the local ecosystems of South America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena integerrima was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European agricultural expansion and has since become naturalized in various regions. The plant is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, pastures, and forest edges. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its ability to spread rapidly and outcompete native vegetation. Its distribution is now widespread across much of the country, particularly in the North Island."
