    "intro": "Amalophyllon repens, commonly known as the creeping amalophyllon, is a rare and specialized plant species. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces delicate, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
