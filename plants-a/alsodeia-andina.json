    "intro": "Alsodeia andina, commonly known as the Andean alsodeia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are often pale yellow or greenish-white, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds."
