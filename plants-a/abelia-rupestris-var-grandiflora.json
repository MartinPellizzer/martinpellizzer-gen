    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelia rupestris var. grandiflora is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia. This variant is typically found in sandy or well-drained soils along the coast or in coastal dunes. It thrives in areas with high humidity and mild winters, making it well adapted to the subtropical climate of its native range. The plant is often seen in open woodlands and along the edges of wetlands. Its native distribution is limited to these specific regions due to its particular ecological requirements.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia rupestris var. grandiflora was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and showy flowers. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. This variety is particularly favored for its large, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the summer. It has been widely distributed in regions with temperate climates, including the eastern and central United States. However, it is important to note that it is considered an invasive species in some areas, where it can outcompete native plants."
