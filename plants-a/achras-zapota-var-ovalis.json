    "intro": "Achras zapota var. ovalis, commonly known as the chicle tree, is a tropical plant native to Central America and northern South America. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a thick, buttressed trunk and large, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by oval, fleshy fruits that are typically yellow or orange when mature. The fruit's pulp is edible and has a mild, sweet flavor, while the tree is also valued for its latex, which is used in the production of chewing gum.",
