    "intro": "[WRONG START] Astellia alpina, commonly known as the alpine astelia, is a perennial plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Astelia alpina thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
