    "intro": "Atriplex patula var. valida, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its small, fleshy, sage-green leaves that are adapted to tolerate high salinity and arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in sandy or saline soils. This variety is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ecological resilience and ability to stabilize dunes."
