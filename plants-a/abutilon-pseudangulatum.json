It is commonly found in the states of Par\u00e1, Amazonas, and Maranh\u00e3o. This plant thrives in humid, lowland environments and is often associated with riverine forests and secondary growth areas. It is also present in parts of Central America, including Panama and Colombia. Due to its ecological significance, it plays a vital role in supporting local biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon pseudangulatum was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, often as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and the Caribbean. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often cultivated for its unique, heart-shaped leaves. It has been reported to naturalize in some regions, posing a potential risk to native ecosystems. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in landscaping and restoration projects."
