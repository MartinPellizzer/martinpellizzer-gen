    "intro": "Arceuthobium hondurense, commonly known as the Honduran dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily infects members of the Fabaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, attaching itself through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and berries that are dispersed by wind or animals. It is native to Central America, particularly Honduras, and thrives in tropical and subtropical forest environments. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly impact the growth and survival of its host plants."
