It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces a tall, slender flowering stem topped with a dense cluster of small, white or pale pink flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ornamental addition to gardens with specific horticultural conditions."
