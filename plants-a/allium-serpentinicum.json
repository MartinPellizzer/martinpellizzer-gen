    "intro": "Allium serpentinicum, commonly known as the serpentine garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, calcareous soils, often found in rocky or serpentine habitats. Its bulbous structures, similar to garlic, are used in traditional medicine and have a strong, pungent aroma. Allium serpentinicum plays an important ecological role in its native environment, supporting pollinators and contributing to soil stability."
