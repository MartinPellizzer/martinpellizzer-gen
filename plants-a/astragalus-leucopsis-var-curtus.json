    "intro": "Astragalus leucopsis var. curtus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, upright stems with alternate, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in dense spikes, and it produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds. This species is adapted to drought conditions and is often found in disturbed or marginal soils."
