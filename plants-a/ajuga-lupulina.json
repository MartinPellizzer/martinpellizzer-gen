    "intro": "Ajuga lupulina, commonly known as the purple deadnettle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of purple or pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. Ajuga lupulina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its ground-covering ability."
