    "intro": "Acacia cambagei, commonly known as the broad-leafed wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, phyllodes that are typically broad and flat. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. Acacia cambagei is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resistance to drought and salinity. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia cambagei is primarily native to New South Wales, Northern Territory, Queensland, and South Australia. This species is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these states. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. The plant is well adapted to the dry climate of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia cambagei was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or rocky soils, typically in coastal or semi-arid regions. It thrives in well-drained environments and is commonly found in dunes or along shorelines. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber or fuelwood. Its introduction has been associated with ecological changes in native plant communities. However, it is considered invasive in some regions, outcompeting native species for resources."
