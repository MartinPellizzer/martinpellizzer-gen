    "intro": "Alyssum alpestre var. genuinum, commonly known as the alpine alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant plants."
