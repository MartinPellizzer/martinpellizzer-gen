    "intro": "Aechmea colombiana, commonly known as the Colombian pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the Andes mountains of Colombia. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The plant produces vibrant, spathiflorous inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, adding visual interest to its appearance. Its foliage is typically a deep green, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Aechmea colombiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance in suitable growing conditions."
