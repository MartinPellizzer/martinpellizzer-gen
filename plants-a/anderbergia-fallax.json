    "intro": "Anderbergia fallax, commonly known as the false sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its bark is smooth and greyish-brown, and it is often used in traditional medicine. Anderbergia fallax is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established."
