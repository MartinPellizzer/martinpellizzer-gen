It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
