    "intro": "Acrostichum auricomum, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a tropical plant native to the wetlands and marshes of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a metallic sheen. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistently moist soil. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies. The golden shield fern is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its striking appearance and adaptability to waterlogged conditions.",
