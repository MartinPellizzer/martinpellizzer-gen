    "intro": "Aristida kelleri, commonly known as Keller's grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to survive in drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it access underground water sources. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping and as a forage plant in dry environments."
