    "intro": "Alyssum punctatum, commonly known as the spotted alyssum, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale purple, arranged in dense clusters atop slender stems. The leaves are narrow and linear, with a silvery or grayish hue due to fine hairs covering the surface. This species thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ability to attract beneficial insects like hoverflies and ladybugs makes it a valuable addition to ecological gardens."
