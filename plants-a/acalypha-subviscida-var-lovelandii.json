It is commonly found in dry to mesic woodlands, prairies, and along roadsides. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed or open habitats. It is known for its distinctive foliage and is sometimes used in ornamental horticulture. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and locally uncommon species in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha subviscida var. lovelandii was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in states like Florida and Georgia. It was originally from tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America. The plant was introduced as an ornamental due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. It has since become naturalized in some areas, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it is present."
