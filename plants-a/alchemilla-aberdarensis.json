    "intro": "Alchemilla aberdarensis, commonly known as the Aberdare alkanet, is a flowering plant native to the Aberdare Range in Kenya. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as montane forests. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a waxy coating, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its ability to thrive in high-altitude regions. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
