    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia hermannii is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It thrives in dry savannas and woodland areas where it forms part of the native vegetation. This plant is commonly found in regions with a warm climate and well-drained soils. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. Acacia hermannii is also sometimes cultivated in other parts of the world for its ornamental value and potential uses in traditional medicine.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia hermannii was mainly introduced to areas with a tropical and subtropical climate, where it can thrive in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Sudan, Ethiopia, and Somalia. This plant is often used for its hardy nature and ability to withstand drought conditions. It has been introduced to various parts of the world for ornamental purposes and for soil stabilization. However, its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its invasive potential in certain environments."
