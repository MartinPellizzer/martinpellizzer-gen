    "intro": "Ardisia brachythyrsa var. stellata, commonly known as the star-leaf ardisia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are broadly ovate with a distinctive star-shaped base, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in shaded to partially sunny conditions and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Its ornamental foliage and compact growth make it a popular choice for woodland gardens and container planting."
