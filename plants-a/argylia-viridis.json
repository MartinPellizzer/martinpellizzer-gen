    "intro": "Argylia viridis, commonly known as the green argyle, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
