    "intro": "Arenaria caesia, commonly known as silver sandplant, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in dunes and coastal plains. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and covered in a fine layer of silvery hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal sands and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
