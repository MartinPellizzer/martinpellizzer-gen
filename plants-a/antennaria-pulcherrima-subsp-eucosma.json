    "intro": "Antennaria pulcherrima subsp. eucosma, commonly known as the pink sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features dense clusters of small, pink to reddish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with silver-green, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in sandy soils. It thrives in well-drained, coastal environments and is often found in dunes and rocky habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to harsh, maritime climates."
