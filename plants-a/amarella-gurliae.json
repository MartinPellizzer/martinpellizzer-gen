    "intro": "Amarella gurliae, commonly known as the Gurlie's amarella, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and potential medicinal properties."
