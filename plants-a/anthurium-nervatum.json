    "intro": "Anthurium nervatum, commonly known as the velvet leaf anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces striking spadices, which are bright red or orange, surrounded by a leaf-like structure called a spathe. Anthurium nervatum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. It is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities."
