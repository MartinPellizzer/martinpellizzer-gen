    "intro": "Agropyron curvatum, commonly known as the curlleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and bluish-green foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites. Its leaves are narrow and often curl at the tips, giving it its common name. Agropyron curvatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
