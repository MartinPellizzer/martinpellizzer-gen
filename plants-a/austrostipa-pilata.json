    "intro": "Austrostipa pilata, commonly known as the tufted wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form low, compact clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. Austrostipa pilata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small fauna in its native range."
