    "intro": "Afrotrichloris martinii, commonly known as the African trichloris, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. The plant features slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spikelet-based inflorescence contains both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Afrotrichloris martinii is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment."
