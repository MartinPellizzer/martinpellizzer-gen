    "intro": "Aydendron macrophyllum, commonly known as the giant fern, is a striking member of the Blechnaceae family, native to the temperate rainforests of South America. This plant is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, making it a prominent feature in its natural habitat. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a soft glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, Aydendron macrophyllum is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
