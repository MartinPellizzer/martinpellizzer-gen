    "intro": "Aechmea prieuriana, commonly known as the Purple Sword fern, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's nourishment. The leaves are typically dark green with a metallic sheen and often have a reddish or purple hue along their edges. It produces vibrant orange or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette, adding a dramatic visual contrast. This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its adaptability and ornamental appeal."
