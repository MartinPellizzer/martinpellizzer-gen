It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant produces pods that contain several elliptical, flat seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Astragalus mucidus is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is released when the plant is disturbed."
