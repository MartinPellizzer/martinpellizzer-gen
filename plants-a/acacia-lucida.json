    "intro": "Acacia lucida, commonly known as the shining acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are delicate and feathery in appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical clusters, which are pollinated by insects and birds. Its seed pods are elongated and woody, containing several flat, kidney-shaped seeds. Acacia lucida thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savannas and rocky areas.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia lucida is primarily native to Australia. It is found in various regions across the continent, including Queensland, New South Wales, and South Australia. This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as woodlands, grasslands, and rocky areas. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range. Acacia lucida is commonly found in the northern and central parts of Australia, where it thrives in well-drained soils.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia lucida was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in arid or semi-arid regions. It thrives in environments where it can establish itself along roadsides, disturbed soils, and open woodlands. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize degraded landscapes, making it a common invasive species in some regions. Its introduction has led to competition with native flora, altering local ecosystems. Due to its adaptability, Acacia lucida is often found in areas where human activity has disrupted natural vegetation."
