    "intro": "Astragalus hamulosus, commonly known as the hookleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, bean-shaped pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Astragalus hamulosus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
