    "intro": "Apicra margaritifera, commonly known as the pearl-spotted orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink with a distinctive yellow or greenish spot near the base. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Apicra margaritifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
