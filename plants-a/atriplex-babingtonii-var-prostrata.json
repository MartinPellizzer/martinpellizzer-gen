    "intro": "Atriplex babingtonii var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate saltbush, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its prostrate or creeping growth habit, with small, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a common component of desert and coastal ecosystems. Its foliage is often used as forage for livestock in areas where other vegetation is scarce."
