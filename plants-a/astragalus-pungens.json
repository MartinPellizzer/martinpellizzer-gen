    "intro": "Astragalus pungens, commonly known as the pungent milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its hairy stems and compound leaves with small, oval leaflets. The plant produces yellow to orange pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Astragalus pungens is known for its deep root system, which helps it survive in arid conditions."
