    "intro": "Andropogon contortus var. macroglumis, commonly known as tall bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are typically purple to reddish in color, adding visual interest in the fall. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common component of native prairie ecosystems. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, and it is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
