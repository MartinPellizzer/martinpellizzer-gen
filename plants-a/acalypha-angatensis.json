    "intro": "Acalypha angatensis, commonly known as the Angatensis spurflower, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spiky inflorescences. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs.
