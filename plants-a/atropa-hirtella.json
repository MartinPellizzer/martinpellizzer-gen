    "intro": "Atropa hirtella, commonly known as poison berry or white henbane, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. Its fruits are small, green berries that turn red when mature, and the plant contains toxic alkaloids, making it harmful to humans and animals. Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes found in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
