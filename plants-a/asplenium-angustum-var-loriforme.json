It features finely divided, lanceolate fronds that are typically dark green and often have a glossy appearance. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found growing on rocks or in shaded woodland areas. It has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the undersides of its leaves. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
