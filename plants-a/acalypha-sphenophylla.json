    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha sphenophylla is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich soil and high rainfall. This plant is commonly found in forests, along riverbanks, and in disturbed habitats. It is well adapted to the warm and moist climate of its native range. Due to its ornamental value, it has also been introduced to other tropical and subtropical regions around the world.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha sphenophylla was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is commonly cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires regular watering to maintain its health and appearance. It is particularly popular in horticultural settings such as gardens and landscapes. However, it is important to note that it may become invasive in certain environments if not properly managed."
