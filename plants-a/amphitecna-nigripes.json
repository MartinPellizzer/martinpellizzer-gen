    "intro": "Amphitecna nigripes, commonly known as the black-winged orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its dark purple to blackish stems and leaves, which are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, delicate orchid-like flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Amphitecna nigripes is considered a rare and endangered species."
