    "intro": "Aleuritopteris veitchii, commonly known as the Veitch's shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Aleuritopteris veitchii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
