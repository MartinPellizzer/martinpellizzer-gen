    "intro": "Aechmea retusa, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The plant's foliage is often adorned with vibrant, spiky bracts that can range in color from red to orange, adding to its ornamental appeal. Aechmea retusa thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil or a suitable substrate. Its unique structure and colorful display make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
