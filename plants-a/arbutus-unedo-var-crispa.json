    "intro": "Arbutus unedo var. crispa, commonly known as the crinkled strawberry tree, is a variant of the strawberry tree native to the western Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive, crinkled leaves that give it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, strawberry-like fruits in the fall. Its evergreen foliage provides year-round interest, making it a popular ornamental plant. The species is adapted to well-drained soils and can thrive in coastal areas due to its tolerance of salt and wind."
