    "intro": "Athyrium filix-femina var. commune, commonly known as the lady fern, is a deciduous fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically bright green and arching in growth habit. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and prefers well-drained, loamy soil. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
