It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination.
