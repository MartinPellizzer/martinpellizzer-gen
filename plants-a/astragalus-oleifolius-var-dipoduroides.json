    "intro": "Astragalus oleifolius var. dipoduroides, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species in harsh environments. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat. The variety dipoduroides is distinguished by its more robust growth and dense, woolly appearance compared to other varieties of Astragalus oleifolius."
