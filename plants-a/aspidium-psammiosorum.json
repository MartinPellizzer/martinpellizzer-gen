    "intro": "Aspidium psammiosorum, commonly known as the sand aspidium, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Aspidium psammiosorum plays a minor ecological role in its habitat, contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small invertebrates."
