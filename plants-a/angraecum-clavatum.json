    "intro": "Angraecum clavatum, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a species of orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow with a deep purple or black center. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it thrives in humid, tropical environments. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by moths, with a long nectar spur that matches the proboscis of its pollinators. Angraecum clavatum is known for its striking appearance and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
