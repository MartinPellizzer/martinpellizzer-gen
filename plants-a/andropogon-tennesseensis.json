It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, slender flowering spikes that bear small, fluffy seeds. It is adapted to moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in disturbed or wetland habitats. Tennessee panicgrass plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
