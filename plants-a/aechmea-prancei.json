    "intro": "Aechmea prancei, commonly known as the Prance's bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant's foliage is often brightly colored, with shades of red, orange, and yellow, which help attract pollinators. It produces inflorescences that emerge from the center of the rosette, featuring showy, spathaceous bracts. Aechmea prancei thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
