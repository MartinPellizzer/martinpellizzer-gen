    "intro": "Armeria transmontana, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of North America. It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of white or pink flowers in spring. The plant has basal leaves that are linear and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. It is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats due to its tolerance for salt and wind. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for coastal gardens and restoration projects."
