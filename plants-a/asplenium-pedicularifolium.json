    "intro": "Asplenium pedicularifolium, commonly known as the hanging spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are clustered at the base, forming a rosette, and are characterized by their narrow, linear shape with a finely toothed margin. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium pedicularifolium is often found in forested areas and is adapted to nutrient-poor substrates."
