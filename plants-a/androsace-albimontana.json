    "intro": "Androsace albimontana, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in early summer. The plant has a rosette of narrow, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh mountain habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and slopes at high altitudes. Androsace albimontana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in alpine ecosystems."
