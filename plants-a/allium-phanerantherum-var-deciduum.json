    "intro": "Allium phanerantherum var. deciduum, commonly known as the deciduous garlic chive, is a perennial herb native to China. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, strap-like leaves and umbel-shaped flower clusters. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs are edible and often used in Chinese cuisine, similar to leeks and chives. The deciduous variety is distinguished by its tendency to lose its foliage in colder months, making it well-suited for temperate climates."
