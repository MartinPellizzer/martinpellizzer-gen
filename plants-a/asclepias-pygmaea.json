    "intro": "Asclepias pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, branching stems that grow close to the ground, often reaching heights of only a few inches. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive horn-shaped structure, which is typical of the milkweed genus. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in arid and rocky environments. Asclepias pygmaea is an important host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing a vital food source for its larvae."
