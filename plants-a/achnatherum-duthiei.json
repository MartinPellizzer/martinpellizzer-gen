    "intro": "Achnatherum duthiei, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Achnatherum duthiei is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with limited water availability. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers.",
