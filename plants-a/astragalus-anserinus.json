It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its seed pods develop into spiny, burs-like structures that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals. Astragalus anserinus is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
