    "intro": "Alisma pubescens, commonly known as the hairy water plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Asia. It features slender, cylindrical stems that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the base of the leaves. Its leaves are elongated and float on the water surface, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Alisma pubescens is often found in shallow water, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystem dynamics."
