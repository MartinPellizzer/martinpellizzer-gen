    "intro": "Astragalus elatus, commonly known as the tall milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Astragalus elatus is adapted to dry environments, with deep taproots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
