    "intro": "Arabis cenisia, commonly known as the winter flowering rock cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has basal leaves that are lobed and hairy, and its stems are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Arabis cenisia is valued in gardens for its early blooming habit and delicate appearance."
