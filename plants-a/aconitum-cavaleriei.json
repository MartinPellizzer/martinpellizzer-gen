It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense, spikelike inflorescences. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. Aconitum cavaleriei contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling.",
