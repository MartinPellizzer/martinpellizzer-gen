    "intro": "Anthericum triphyllum, commonly known as the three-leaved lily, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the wetlands of North America. It features a basal rosette of three elliptical, waxy leaves that are often submerged in water. The plant produces a tall, slender stem that bears a single, showy white or pale pink flower with six petals. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist environments. Anthericum triphyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in wetland habitats."
