    "intro": "Arctium lasiandrum, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and rough, hairy stems. The plant produces spiny, bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals or clothing. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in fine, stiff hairs. Arctium lasiandrum is often found in meadows, wastelands, and along roadsides, thriving in disturbed soils."
