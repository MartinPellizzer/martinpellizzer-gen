    "intro": "Anacamptis coriophora subsp. martrinii, commonly known as the Martini's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, slender flower spike bearing a single, pale purple or white orchid flower. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It is a short-lived perennial that relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
