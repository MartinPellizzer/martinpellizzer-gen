    "intro": "Agropyron glaucum f. aristatum, commonly known as the blue wheatgrass or slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. This form is distinguished by its elongated leaf blades and reduced flowering structures compared to the typical form of Agropyron glaucum."
