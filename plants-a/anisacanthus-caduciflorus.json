It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, blooming in summer. The plant has woody stems and thick, fleshy leaves that are adapted to arid environments. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Anisacanthus caduciflorus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
