    "intro": "Acaena buchananii var. buchananii, commonly known as the New Zealand thistle, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It features dense clusters of spiny, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright red or orange berries. The plant has woody stems and hairy leaves, which are adapted to the cool, temperate climate of its native habitat. It is often found in coastal and subalpine regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in areas outside its native range.",

This plant typically grows in rocky and coastal areas, often in dry and sunny environments. It is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of these regions. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within New Zealand's southern ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena buchananii var. buchananii was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there during the 19th century as part of the European flora introduced for ornamental purposes. This plant has since become naturalized and is now found in various habitats across the country. It is commonly found in coastal areas, dry hills, and disturbed sites. However, it is considered a potential weed in some regions due to its ability to spread rapidly."
