    "intro": "Abrahamia lecomtei, commonly known as the Lecomte's abrahamia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen shrub form. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.",

It is endemic to Madagascar, meaning it is not found anywhere else in the world. The plant is adapted to the local climate and soil conditions of the island. Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrahamia lecomtei was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was first documented in Oregon in the late 19th century, likely through human activity such as horticultural trade or accidental introduction. This plant has since spread to parts of Washington and northern California. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native flora in certain ecosystems."
