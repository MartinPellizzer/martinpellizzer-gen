    "intro": "Argemone subalpina, commonly known as the alpine argemone, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in the summer months. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize harsh environments. Argemone subalpina is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes."
