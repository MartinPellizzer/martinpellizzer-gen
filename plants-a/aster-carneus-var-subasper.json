    "intro": "Aster carneus var. subasper, commonly known as the rough sandwort, is a perennial herb native to arid and rocky habitats in North America. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, succulent leaves that are densely covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are characterized by a rough, gritty texture due to the dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. This variant is distinguished from the typical Aster carneus by its more pronounced leaf texture and slightly different floral arrangement."
