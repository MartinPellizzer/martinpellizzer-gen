    "intro": "Arctium commutatum, commonly known as the greater burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces spiny, bur-like fruits that are adapted for seed dispersal by attaching to animals. Its flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets, typical of the daisy family. Arctium commutatum is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates."
