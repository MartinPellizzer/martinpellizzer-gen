    "intro": "Asperula doerfleri, commonly known as the silver leaf azalea, is a flowering shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that has a distinctive silvery-blue hue due to the presence of fine, soft hairs on the leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It prefers partial shade and well-drained, acidic soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Asperula doerfleri is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cooler climates."
