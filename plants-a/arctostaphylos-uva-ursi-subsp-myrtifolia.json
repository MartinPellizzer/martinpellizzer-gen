    "intro": "Arctostaphylos uva-ursi subsp. myrtifolia, commonly known as red bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It features dense clusters of small, leathery leaves that are typically reddish or bronze in color, providing a distinctive visual appearance. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its berries are dark red or black, containing a single seed, and are an important food source for various wildlife species. The subspecies is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
