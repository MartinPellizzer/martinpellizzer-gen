    "intro": "Aeonium, commonly known as the \"Roman Candle\" or \"Tree Aeonium,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the Crassulaceae family. These succulent plants are characterized by their rosette-shaped leaves, which are often thick and fleshy to store water. Aeonium species are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, southern Europe, and the Mediterranean. They produce striking inflorescences that resemble candles, typically in shades of yellow, orange, or red. Many aeoniums are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
