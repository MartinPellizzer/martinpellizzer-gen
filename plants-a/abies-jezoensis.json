    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies jezoensis is primarily native to eastern Asia, specifically Japan, Korea, and the Russian Far East. It is commonly found in mountainous regions, where it thrives in cool, moist climates. This species is often associated with mixed forests and grows at elevations ranging from 500 to 2,000 meters. Its natural habitat includes areas with well-drained soils and moderate precipitation. It is an important component of the temperate coniferous forest ecosystems in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies jezoensis was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, particularly in regions of East Asia. It is commonly found in mountainous regions of Japan, Korea, and Russia. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often planted in gardens and parks. It prefers partial shade to full sun and can tolerate a range of soil types. Due to its hardiness, it has been introduced to several regions outside its native range for landscaping purposes."
