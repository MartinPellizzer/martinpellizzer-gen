    "intro": "Achroanthes montana, commonly known as the mountain ghostflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high elevations of the western United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and distinctive, often pale or white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided lobes, and it produces small, inconspicuous fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of high-altitude ecosystem health.",
