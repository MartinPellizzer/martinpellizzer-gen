    "intro": "Androsace rotundifolia subsp. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe. It features a dense rosette of rounded, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, typically arranged in clusters at the center of the rosette. Its subspecies designation, *glandulosa*, refers to the presence of glandular structures on its leaves and stems. This species is well adapted to rocky, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes."
