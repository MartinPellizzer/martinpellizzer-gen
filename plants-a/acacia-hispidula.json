    "intro": "Acacia hispidula, commonly known as the rough wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and compound leaves with small, stiff, hairy leaflets. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing drought resistance. It produces small, woody pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Acacia hispidula is often used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental value.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia hispidula is primarily native to New South Wales and Queensland in Australia. This species is commonly found in a variety of habitats, including open woodlands, grasslands, and rocky areas. It is well adapted to the dry and semi-arid conditions of these regions. Acacia hispidula is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its distribution reflects its ecological flexibility and resilience in the Australian landscape.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia hispidula was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in the North Island, where it spreads along roadsides and in disturbed areas. The plant is considered a weed in some parts of its range because of its rapid growth and competitive nature. It prefers full sun and well-drained soils, making it adaptable to different environments. Despite its invasive tendencies, Acacia hispidula is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which can improve soil fertility."
