    "intro": "Arthraxon quartinianus var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous arthraxon, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically hairless or nearly so. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its low maintenance and adaptability, it is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
