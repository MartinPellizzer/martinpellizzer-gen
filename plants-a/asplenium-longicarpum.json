    "intro": "Asplenium longicarpum, commonly known as the long-fruited spleenwort, is a member of the Aspleniaceae family and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic fern that grows on rocks or tree trunks, often in temperate regions. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a prominent midrib, and its sporangia are clustered in sori along the underside of the fronds. Asplenium longicarpum is characterized by its long, slender spore cases, which are often arranged in a single row on the sorus. This species is relatively uncommon and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations."
