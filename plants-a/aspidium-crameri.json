    "intro": "Aspidium crameri, commonly known as the Cramer's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often submerged or partially submerged. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. Aspidium crameri plays a role in water filtration and is sometimes used in ornamental gardening."
