    "intro": "Anthurium subdeltoideum, commonly known as the broad-leaf anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces striking spadices, which are modified leaves that enclose the actual flowers. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Anthurium subdeltoideum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
