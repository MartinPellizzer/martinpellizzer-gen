    "intro": "Aspidistra stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf aspidistra, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India, China, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its dark green, glossy, and narrow lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Aspidistra stenophylla is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
