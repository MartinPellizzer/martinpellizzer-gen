    "intro": "Armeria segoviensis, commonly known as Segovian thrift, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, which is also known as the ice plant family. This perennial herb is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The leaves are typically linear and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy environments."
