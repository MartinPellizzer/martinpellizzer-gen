    "intro": "Apocynum hastatum, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are oval-shaped with a distinctive waxy coating, and the plant produces toxic, milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions. Apocynum hastatum plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees."
