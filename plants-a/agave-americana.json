    "intro": "Agave americana, commonly known as the century plant, is a succulent plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped arrangement of thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a blue-gray hue. The plant produces a tall flower stalk that can reach several meters in height, bearing numerous white or yellow flowers. Agave americana is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems to survive in dry conditions. It is also widely cultivated for its use in producing agave nectar and as an ornamental plant."
