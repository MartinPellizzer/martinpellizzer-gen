    "intro": "Alchemilla subglobosa, commonly known as the globular lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rounded rosette of silver-green, hairy leaves that form a dense, cushion-like structure. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla subglobosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
