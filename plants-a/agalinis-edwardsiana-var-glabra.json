    "intro": "Agalinis edwardsiana var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth agalinis, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing pink to purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in sandy or gravelly areas. The smooth, hairless leaves and its overall appearance make it distinguishable from other agalinis species."
