It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in harsh, nutrient-poor soils, showcasing its adaptability to extreme environments. Its leaves are often compound, and it produces pods that contain small, rounded seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, Astragalus vulcanicus is considered a vulnerable species."
