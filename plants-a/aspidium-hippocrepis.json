    "intro": "Aspidium hippocrepis, commonly known as the horse's tail fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its long, creeping rhizomes that produce clusters of small, dark green, lance-shaped fronds. The fronds are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, giving the plant a distinctive, compact appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. The plant is known for its ability to form dense mats, which can help prevent soil erosion."
