    "intro": "Alseodaphne cujumary, commonly known as the Cujumary or Malabar Alseodaphne, is a small evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and elliptical, leathery leaves.

It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
