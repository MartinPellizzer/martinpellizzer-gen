    "intro": "Allium thracicum, commonly known as the Thrace onion, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces bulbous structures that are similar to onions, though they are not typically used in culinary applications. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Allium thracicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
