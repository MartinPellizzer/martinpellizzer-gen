    "intro": "Allocasuarina striata, commonly known as the Narrow-leaf Sheoak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive feathery, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits containing one or two seeds. It is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Allocasuarina striata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
