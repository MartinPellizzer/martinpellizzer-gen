    "intro": "Aegilops uniaristata, commonly known as the single-awned goatgrass, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with a single awn on each lemma, giving it its common name. It is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Aegilops uniaristata is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement."
