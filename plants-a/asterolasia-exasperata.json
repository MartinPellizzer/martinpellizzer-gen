It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a dense, compact cluster, often surrounded by bracts that give it a distinctive appearance. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Asterolasia exasperata is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is a hardy species that thrives in harsh environments."
