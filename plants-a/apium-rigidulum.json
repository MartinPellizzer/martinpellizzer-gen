It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its aromatic, often hollow stems. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are usually bluish-green in color. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are arranged in umbels, a common feature of the Apiaceae family. Apium rigidulum is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
