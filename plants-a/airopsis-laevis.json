    "intro": "Airopsis laevis, commonly known as the smooth sea fan, is a species of soft coral found in tropical marine environments. It has a branching, fan-like structure that resembles a sea fan, with a pale green to brown coloration. The coral is characterized by its smooth, flexible texture and lacks the spines found in other sea fan species. It thrives in shallow, warm waters with moderate to strong currents. Airopsis laevis plays an important role in reef ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine organisms."
