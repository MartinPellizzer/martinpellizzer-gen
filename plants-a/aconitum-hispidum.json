    "intro": "Aconitum hispidum, commonly known as the hairy monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture, and it produces toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous to handle. Aconitum hispidum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value despite its poisonous nature.",
