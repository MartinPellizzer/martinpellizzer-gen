    "intro": "Aristolochia mycteria, commonly known as the Indian pipe or birthroot, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pipe-shaped flowers that are often pale green or white. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swamps. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a waxy appearance, while its fruit is a dark, fleshy capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
