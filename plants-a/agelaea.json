    "intro": "Agelaea, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. Agelaea species are typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a short, underground rhizome and produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
