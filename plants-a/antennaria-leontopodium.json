    "intro": "Antennaria leontopodium, commonly known as the edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the high alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a symbol of resilience and purity in many cultures. Due to its restricted range and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is also considered a vulnerable species."
