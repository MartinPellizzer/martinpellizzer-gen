    "intro": "Asplenium radicans var. argutidentatum, commonly known as the creeping spleenwort, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, producing dense mats of foliage that often cover rocky or shaded surfaces. The fronds are typically lanceolate to ovate in shape, with serrated margins and a dark green, leathery texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or on moist rock faces. This variety is distinguished by its finely toothed leaflets and is valued for its ornamental appeal in botanical gardens."
