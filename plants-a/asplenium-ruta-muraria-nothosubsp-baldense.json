    "intro": "Asplenium ruta-muraria nothosubsp. baldense, commonly known as the southern rock spleenwort, is a fern that thrives in rocky, calcareous habitats. It is characterized by its small, leathery, evergreen leaves that are often clustered on rock surfaces. The plant has a compact growth habit and typically forms dense mats on limestone or granite. Its fronds are usually narrowly lanceolate and have a distinctive, serrated margin. This nothosubspecies is considered a hybrid form, likely resulting from crosses between A. ruta-muraria and other related species."
