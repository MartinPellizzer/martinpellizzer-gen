It is characterized by its upright, branching stems that bear clusters of small, delicate flowers in shades of pink, red, or white. The plant produces feathery, plume-like inflorescences that give it a soft, airy appearance. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Astilbe barbata is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and prolonged blooming period."
