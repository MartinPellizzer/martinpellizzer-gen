    "intro": "Arisaema laminatum, commonly known as the Chinese arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia. It features a distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaf that is typically bright green with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces an underground tuber, which is the primary structure for storage and propagation. Its flowering stem bears a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe, which is often brightly colored. Arisaema laminatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and unique floral structure."
