    "intro": "Alisma validum, commonly known as narrow-leaved water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are usually submerged or floating, with a smooth, waxy surface. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences and bloom in early summer. Alisma validum is valued for its ability to thrive in aquatic environments and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
