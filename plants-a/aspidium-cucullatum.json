    "intro": "Aspidium cucullatum, commonly known as the hooded water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green and have a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium cucullatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic or semi-aquatic gardens."
