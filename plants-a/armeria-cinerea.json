    "intro": "Armeria cinerea, commonly known as silver tuft or sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial with dense, silver-gray foliage that helps it tolerate salty and windy conditions. The plant produces showy clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves and compact growth habit make it well-suited for coastal gardens and rockeries. Armeria cinerea is also valued for its ability to stabilize sandy soils and its ornamental appeal in maritime landscapes."
