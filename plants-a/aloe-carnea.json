    "intro": "Aloe carnea, commonly known as the hardy aloe or red aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with red or purple markings, which help it store water and protect against intense sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, adding ornamental value. Aloe carnea is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid climates. Its leaves can be used to make gel, which has various medicinal and skincare applications."
