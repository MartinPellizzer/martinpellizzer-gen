    "intro": "Arbutus lanceolata, commonly known as the California strawberry tree, is a broadleaf evergreen shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It features glossy, lance-shaped leaves that remain green throughout the year. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its bark is thick, scaly, and reddish-brown, providing a distinctive appearance. Arbutus lanceolata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal regions and chaparral habitats."
