    "intro": "Asclepias vestita var. parishii, commonly known as the Parish's milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is a vital host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing food for both the caterpillars and the nectar for adult butterflies. This species is also adapted to arid environments, making it a resilient addition to xeriscaped gardens."
