    "intro": "Andropogon contortus var. allionii, commonly known as allion's bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves that are often rolled when young, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its botanical features include fibrous roots and a rhizomatous growth habit, which helps it spread and establish in wet environments. It is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
