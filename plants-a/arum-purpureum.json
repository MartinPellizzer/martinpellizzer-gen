    "intro": "Arum purpureum, commonly known as the purple arum, is a striking tropical plant native to parts of Africa. It features large, arrow-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored, with a deep purple hue on the underside. The plant produces a unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a showy, petal-like spathe. Its flowers are typically green or yellow, with a strong, unpleasant odor that attracts pollinators like flies. Arum purpureum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in warm climates due to its dramatic appearance."
