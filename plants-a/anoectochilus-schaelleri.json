    "intro": "Anoectochilus schaelleri, commonly known as the Sch\u00e4ler's slipper orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive slipper-shaped lip, which is a key feature in the Orchidaceae family. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its leaves are usually broad and fleshy, adapted to store moisture in its natural habitat. Anoectochilus schaelleri produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn."
