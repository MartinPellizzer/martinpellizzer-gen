    "intro": "Atelophragma purpusii, commonly known as the Purpus's spider-orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, spider-like flower structure with elongated petals and a prominent, twisted column. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it can receive indirect light. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
