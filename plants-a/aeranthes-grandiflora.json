    "intro": "Aeranthes grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered orchid, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale blue or violet, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that attracts pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Aeranthes grandiflora is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in warm, humid climates."
