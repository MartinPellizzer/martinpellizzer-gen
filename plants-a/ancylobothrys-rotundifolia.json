    "intro": "Ancylobothrys rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leafed wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a waxy coating and produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a day, and it relies on insect pollination. The plant's unique leaf shape and delicate appearance make it a notable species in its native habitat."
