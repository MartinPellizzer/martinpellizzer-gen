    "intro": "Agathis kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu agathis, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It belongs to the family Araucariaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and broad, feather-like leaves. The tree produces large, conifer-like cones that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in humid, high-altitude environments and is often found in primary rainforests. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
