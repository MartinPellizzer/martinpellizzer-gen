    "intro": "Andinia lappacea, commonly known as the Lapp's bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains in South America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often with a distinctive white or yellow throat. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help protect it from harsh weather. Andinia lappacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
