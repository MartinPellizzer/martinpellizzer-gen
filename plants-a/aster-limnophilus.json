    "intro": "Aster limnophilus, commonly known as the water aster, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in North America. It thrives in moist soils and is often found along the edges of ponds, lakes, and streams. The plant produces clusters of small, usually white or pale blue flowers in the late summer and early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture. Aster limnophilus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
