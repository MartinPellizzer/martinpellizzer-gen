    "intro": "Aconitum variegatum var. album, commonly known as the white-flowered monkshood, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear large, showy flowers. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veining pattern, and its flowers are typically blue or purple, though the var. album variant is notable for its white petals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for areas with young children or pets.",
