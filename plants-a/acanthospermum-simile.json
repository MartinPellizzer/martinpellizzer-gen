    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthospermum simile is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. It is commonly found in open woodlands, grasslands, and along roadsides in these areas. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to regions with distinct wet and dry seasons. It is often seen growing in disturbed habitats, showing its preference for sunny and warm environments. Due to its hardy nature, it has also been introduced to other parts of the world in some horticultural contexts.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthospermum simile was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in degraded areas. It is commonly found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, fields, and wastelands. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soils. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it an effective pioneer species. However, it can become invasive if not managed properly."
