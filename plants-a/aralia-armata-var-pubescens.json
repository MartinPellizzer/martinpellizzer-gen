    "intro": "Aralia armata var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy aralia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically palmately arranged and covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by berry-like fruits that are often red or yellow in color. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some horticultural settings for its unique foliage and growth habit."
