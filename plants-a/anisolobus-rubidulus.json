    "intro": "Anisolobus rubidulus, commonly known as the red-stemmed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats. It possesses specialized structures called bladders, which it uses to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant has thin, erect stems that are often reddish in color, giving it its common name. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, while its true leaves are modified into bladder-like organs. Anisolobus rubidulus thrives in nutrient-poor environments, relying on its carnivorous adaptations to supplement its nutrient intake."
