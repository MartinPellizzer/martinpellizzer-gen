    "intro": "Artemisia maritima, commonly known as seaside wormwood, is a hardy perennial herb native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its gray-green, aromatic foliage and small, yellowish flower clusters that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its leaves contain volatile oils, which contribute to its strong, pungent scent. Artemisia maritima is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and as a source of natural compounds used in traditional medicine."
