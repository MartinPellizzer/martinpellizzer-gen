It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pink to red flowers. The plant produces trifoliate leaves and has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in sandy or rocky soils. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Anthyllis sanguinea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
