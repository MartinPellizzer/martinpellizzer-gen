    "intro": "Antennaria manicouagana, commonly known as the Canadian sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the boreal and subarctic regions of North America. It belongs to the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is characterized by its small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in open, disturbed habitats such as dunes, roadsides, and barren ground. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Antennaria manicouagana plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
