    "intro": "Anacamptis palustris subsp. palustris, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, flowering stems that bear whorls of pale pink to white, spurred flowers. The plant is adapted to moist, nutrient-poor soils and thrives in marshes, fens, and other wetland environments. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly bees, and it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity. The subspecies palustris is distinguished by its more robust growth and broader habitat range compared to other subspecies of the genus."
