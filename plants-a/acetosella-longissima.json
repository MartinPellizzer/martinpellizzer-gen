    "intro": "Acetosella longissima, commonly known as mouse ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and early summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands, stream banks, and garden beds. Acetosella longissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas.",
