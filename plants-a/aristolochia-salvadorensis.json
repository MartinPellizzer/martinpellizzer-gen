It is characterized by its unique, heart-shaped leaves and striking, pipe-shaped flowers that are often greenish-yellow in color. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
