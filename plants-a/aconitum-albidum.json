    "intro": "Aconitum albidum, commonly known as the white aconite, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy, white to pale blue flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. Aconitum albidum contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring caution during handling.",
