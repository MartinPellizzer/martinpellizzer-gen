    "intro": "Aconitum meyeri, commonly known as Meyer's monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking, hooded blue-purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
