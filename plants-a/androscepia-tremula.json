    "intro": "Androscepia tremula, commonly known as the trembling androscepia, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
