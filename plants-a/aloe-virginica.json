    "intro": "Aloe virginica, commonly known as the narrow-leaf aloe, is a succulent plant native to the southeastern United States. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically narrow and covered in a whitish, powdery coating called farina. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Aloe virginica is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves to survive drought conditions. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
