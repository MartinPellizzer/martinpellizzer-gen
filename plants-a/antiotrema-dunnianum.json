    "intro": "Antiotrema dunnianum, commonly known as the slender leaved orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often near streams or in dense forest understories. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to anchor securely in rocky or loamy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
