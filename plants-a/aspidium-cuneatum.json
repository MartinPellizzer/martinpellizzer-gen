    "intro": "Aspidium cuneatum, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia clustered in sori. Aspidium cuneatum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in partial shade."
