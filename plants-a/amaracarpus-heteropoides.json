    "intro": "Amaracarpus heteropoides, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its unique, zigzagging fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce both roots and new shoots. Its leaves are pinnate, with small, oval-shaped pinnae that are arranged alternately along the fronds. Amaracarpus heteropoides is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, feathery appearance."
