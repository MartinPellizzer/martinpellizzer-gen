    "intro": "Arenaria aggregata subsp. capitata, commonly known as the clustered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping. It is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats, contributing to soil stabilization in harsh environments."
