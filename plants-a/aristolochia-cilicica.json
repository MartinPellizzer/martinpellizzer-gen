    "intro": "Aristolochia cilicica, commonly known as the Cilicia birthwort, is a climbing vine native to the Mediterranean region. It features heart-shaped, aromatic leaves with a distinctive, waxy texture. The plant produces showy, hooded flowers that are typically purple or greenish in color. Its tubular flowers are adapted for pollination by specific insects, such as flies. However, the plant contains toxic compounds and is considered a potential bioindicator of certain environmental conditions."
