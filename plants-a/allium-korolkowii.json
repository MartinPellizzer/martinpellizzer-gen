    "intro": "Allium korolkowii, commonly known as the Siberian garlic or Korolkov's garlic, is a bulbous perennial plant native to Central Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of pale purple to pink flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant's bulb is edible, though it is less commonly cultivated than other allium species. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Allium korolkowii is valued for its ornamental appeal and mild garlic-like aroma."
