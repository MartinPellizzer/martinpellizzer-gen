    "intro": "Ageratina tomentella, commonly known as the woolly ageratum, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish foliage and small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite and covered in fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. Ageratina tomentella is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in garden settings with proper care."
