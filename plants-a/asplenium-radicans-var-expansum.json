    "intro": "Asplenium radicans var. expansum, commonly known as the creeping spleenwort, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, with slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes. The leaves are typically lanceolate or ovate, with a dark green, glossy surface and a serrated margin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. This variety is noted for its ability to form dense mats, making it a common epiphytic or lithophytic species in its native habitat."
