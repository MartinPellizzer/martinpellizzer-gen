    "intro": "Arenaria holosteoides var. stellarioides, commonly known as the star-like sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It is an important component of tundra ecosystems, providing food for various herbivores."
