    "intro": "Aristolochia sylvicola, commonly known as the red spiderflower, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, tubular, and often fragrant flowers that resemble a spider's web, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as a climbing vine, producing heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. Its flowers are usually purple or reddish in color, with intricate patterns that attract specific pollinators. The genus Aristolochia is known for containing aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals, making the plant both ecologically significant and potentially hazardous."
