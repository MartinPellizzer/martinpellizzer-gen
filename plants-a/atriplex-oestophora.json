    "intro": "Atriplex oestophora, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is well adapted to saline and arid environments, with small, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact spikes, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep water sources in dry conditions. Atriplex oestophora plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
