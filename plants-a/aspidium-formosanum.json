    "intro": "Aspidium formosanum, commonly known as the Formosan water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating its reproduction."
