    "intro": "Alchemilla transpolaris, commonly known as the Arctic lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its rosette of silver-green, hairy leaves that help it retain heat in cold environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra habitats. Alchemilla transpolaris is adapted to harsh climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native ecosystems."
