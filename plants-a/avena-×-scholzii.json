    "intro": "Avena \u00d7 scholzii, commonly known as the intermediate oat, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Avena sativa (common oat) and Avena fatua (wild oat). It is a perennial grass that typically grows in temperate regions and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in agricultural settings. Avena \u00d7 scholzii is notable for its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in disturbed environments."
