    "intro": "Agrostis alba var. gracilis, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and delicate, hair-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. This plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its flowering heads are small and spike-like, producing lightweight seeds that are dispersed by wind. Agrostis alba var. gracilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting insect and bird populations."
