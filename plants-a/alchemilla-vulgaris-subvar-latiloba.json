It features a low-growing rosette of broad, softly hairy, dark green leaves that are often tinged with silver or white on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in branched clusters during late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its leaves are used in herbal medicine and are also popular in ornamental gardening for their attractive appearance."
