    "intro": "Astropanax polysciadius, commonly known as the mountain ginseng, is a rare and endangered plant native to the high-altitude regions of China. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish hue. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil, often found in forested mountainous areas. Due to its medicinal properties and limited distribution, it is highly valued in traditional Chinese medicine."
