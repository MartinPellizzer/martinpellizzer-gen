    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthus maderaspatensis is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, specifically Brazil. It is found in the states of Bahia, Pernambuco, and Piau\u00ed, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. This plant is commonly associated with tropical rainforests and is often found growing near streams or in moist, well-drained soils. It is also present in parts of northern Argentina and Paraguay, though its distribution is more limited in these areas. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions but remains most abundant in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus maderaspatensis was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its striking foliage and architectural appearance. It is commonly used in gardens and as a decorative plant in urban settings. The plant has been introduced to several regions outside its native habitat, including parts of Europe and North America. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in non-native environments. Despite its aesthetic value, careful management is recommended to prevent ecological disruption."
