    "intro": "Acer monspessulanum f. hispanicum, commonly known as the Spanish maple, is a rare and distinctive variant of the maple tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its small, palmate leaves that are typically red or orange in the autumn, adding vibrant color to the landscape. The plant thrives in mild, temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after species for horticultural collections. However, due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in the wild.",
