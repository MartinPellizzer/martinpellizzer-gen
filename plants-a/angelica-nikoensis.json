    "intro": "Angelica nikoensis, commonly known as Niko's angelica, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley, carrots, and celery, and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, a feature typical of the carrot family. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Angelica nikoensis is considered a vulnerable species."
