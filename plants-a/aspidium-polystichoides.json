    "intro": "Aspidium polystichoides, commonly known as the broad-leafed wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its large, triangular, and often deeply lobed fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in clusters called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests and along stream banks. Aspidium polystichoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
