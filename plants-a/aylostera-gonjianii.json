    "intro": "Aylostera gonjianii, commonly known as the Gonji's aylostera, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Aylostera gonjianii is considered a species of conservation concern."
