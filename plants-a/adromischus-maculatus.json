    "intro": "Adromischus maculatus, commonly known as the \"Lamb's Ear\" or \"Dotting Plant,\" is a succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, white or grayish pubescence, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the warmer months. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact size and drought tolerance. Adromischus maculatus thrives in bright, indirect light and requires minimal watering, making it an ideal choice for low-maintenance gardening.",
