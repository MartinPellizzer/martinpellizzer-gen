    "intro": "Ammophila arundinacea, commonly known as beach grass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous root system that stabilizes sandy soils and prevents erosion. The plant has tall, cylindrical stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer, followed by feathery seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its ability to thrive in harsh coastal environments makes it an important species for dune stabilization and habitat creation."
