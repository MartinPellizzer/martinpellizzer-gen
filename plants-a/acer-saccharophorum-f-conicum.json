    "intro": "Acer saccharophorum f. conicum, commonly known as the dwarf sugar maple, is a compact form of the sugar maple tree. It is characterized by its small size, typically reaching heights of only 6 to 10 feet, making it suitable for smaller gardens or urban landscapes. The plant features palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and gold in the fall. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with a texture that becomes more rugged as the tree matures. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.",
