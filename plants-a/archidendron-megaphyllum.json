It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, followed by flat, woody pods containing elliptical seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat."
