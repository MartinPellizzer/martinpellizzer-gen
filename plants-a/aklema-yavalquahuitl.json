    "intro": "Aklema yavalquahuitl, commonly known as the \"flower of the sacred mountain,\" is a rare and elusive plant native to the high altitudes of central Mexico. It belongs to the genus Aklema, which is part of the Apiaceae family, known for its aromatic and often medicinal properties. The plant features delicate, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the early spring. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to the cool, moist environments it inhabits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare species with significant ecological and cultural importance."
