    "intro": "Azalea indica var. lateritia, commonly known as the rock azalea, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense foliage and clusters of showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soil and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its ability to tolerate rocky and well-drained conditions. The variety is known for its hardiness and ability to withstand colder temperatures compared to other azalea species."
