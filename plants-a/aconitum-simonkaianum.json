    "intro": "Aconitum simonkaianum, commonly known as the Simonkaian monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking purple to blue bell-shaped flowers. The plant has palmately divided, deeply lobed leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of soft, woolly hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered dangerous to handle and should be approached with caution.",
