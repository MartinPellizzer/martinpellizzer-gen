    "intro": "Aegiceras corniculatum, commonly known as the mangrove apple or sea apple, is a halophytic shrub native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is adapted to saline and brackish water environments, often found in mangrove ecosystems. The plant has distinctive, leathery, ovate leaves that are typically clustered at the base of the stems. Its small, yellowish flowers are followed by fleshy, red berries that are an important food source for various birds and animals. The roots of Aegiceras corniculatum play a crucial role in stabilizing coastal sediments and preventing erosion."
