    "intro": "Arctium karelinii, commonly known as Karelin's burdock, is a perennial herb native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and rough, hairy stems. The plant produces large, spiny burrs that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals or clothing. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and clustered in composite heads. Karelin's burdock is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates."
