    "intro": "Asclepias contrayerba, commonly known as the lesser milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers with a distinctive heart-shaped structure at the base. It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is known for its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals. Asclepias contrayerba plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae."
