    "intro": "Asplenium caudatum var. minor, commonly known as the small-tailed spleenwort, is a compact, evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices, walls, and forest floors. The plant features a short, upright rhizome with closely clustered, lanceolate leaves that have a distinctive, toothed margin. Its fronds are usually dark green and remain semi-evergreen throughout the year. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its compact growth habit."
