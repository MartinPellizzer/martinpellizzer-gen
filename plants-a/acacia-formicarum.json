    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia formicarum is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is commonly found in savannas and shrublands. This species is well adapted to drought conditions and can survive in areas with low rainfall. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. Acacia formicarum is also known for its ability to form associations with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility in its habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia formicarum was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas, particularly in the Western and Eastern Cape provinces. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is often seen along roadsides and in disturbed habitats. Its introduction has led to some ecological concerns due to its potential to invade native vegetation. Despite its spread, it is valued for its hardiness and ability to provide habitat for local wildlife."
