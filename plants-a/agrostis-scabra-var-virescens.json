    "intro": "Agrostis scabra var. virescens, commonly known as the green rough bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a vibrant green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
