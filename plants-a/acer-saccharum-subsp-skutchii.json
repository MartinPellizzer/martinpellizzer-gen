    "intro": "Acer saccharum subsp. skutchii, commonly known as the Skutch's sugar maple, is a subspecies native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is characterized by its distinct leaf morphology, including coarsely serrated margins and a more elongated shape compared to the typical sugar maple. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. Its leaves turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn, contributing to its ornamental value. This subspecies is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates.",
