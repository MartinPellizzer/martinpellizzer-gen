    "intro": "Ariopsis protanthera, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the southeastern United States and the Caribbean. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or muddy soils along the shoreline. The plant features showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often blooming in summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and often covered in fine hairs. The sea hibiscus is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it a hardy coastal plant."
