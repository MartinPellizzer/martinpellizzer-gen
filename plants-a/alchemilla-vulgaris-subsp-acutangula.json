    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris subsp. acutangula, commonly known as narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of basal, lanceolate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or stream banks. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
