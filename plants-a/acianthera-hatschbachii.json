    "intro": "Acianthera hatschbachii, commonly known as the Hatschbach's acianthera, is a rare orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.",
