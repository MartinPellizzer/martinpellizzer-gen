    "intro": "Abatia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered abatia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its slender, woody stems and simple, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Its small, white to pale pink flowers are typically clustered in terminal inflorescences. Abatia parviflora is often found in humid, shaded environments such as forest understories.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abatia parviflora is primarily native to Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Peru. This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and undergrowth. Abatia parviflora is often associated with humid climates and is part of the native flora in these areas. Its distribution is largely restricted to the western regions of South America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abatia parviflora was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in states like Florida and Georgia. It is commonly found in wetland areas, swamp forests, and along the edges of freshwater bodies. This species thrives in humid, subtropical climates with high rainfall and well-drained soils. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and disturbed habitats. However, it is considered a non-native species in these regions and has not been widely reported as invasive."
