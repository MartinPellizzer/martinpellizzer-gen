    "intro": "Atitara macrodon, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to two meters in diameter, which float on the water's surface. The plant has a showy, pale yellow to white flower that blooms at night, attracting pollinators such as bats and moths. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the mud while absorbing nutrients from the water. Atitara macrodon plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water filtration."
