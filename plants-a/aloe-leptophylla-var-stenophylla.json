    "intro": "Aloe leptophylla var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
