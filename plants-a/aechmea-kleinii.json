    "intro": "Aechmea kleinii, commonly known as the Klein's bromeliad, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from intense sunlight. Aechmea kleinii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
