    "intro": "Asplenium repente, commonly known as the running spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that often form dense, mat-like growths. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its rhizomes and leaf surfaces. It is commonly found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions. Asplenium repente plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to the understory vegetation and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
