It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are often covered with glandular hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. This subvariety is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its use in forage and erosion control."
