    "intro": "Anisocarpus, commonly known as wild millet, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its unique seed pods that are unequal in size, giving the genus its name. The plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Anisocarpus species are perennial herbs that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. They are adapted to thrive in low-nutrient environments and are sometimes used for forage or soil stabilization."
