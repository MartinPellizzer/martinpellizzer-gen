    "intro": "Arabis thaliana, commonly known as the mouse-ear cress, is a small flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or yellow flowers. The plant is annual or biennial, depending on the climate, and thrives in moist, disturbed soils. Arabis thaliana is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbage and mustard. It is also a model organism in plant biology research due to its short life cycle and genetic simplicity."
