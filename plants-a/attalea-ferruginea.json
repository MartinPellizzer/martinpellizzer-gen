    "intro": "Attalea ferruginea, commonly known as the yellow palm or golden palm, is a species of palm native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves and produces clusters of yellowish-orange fruits. The plant is often found in wetland and coastal areas, thriving in humid, tropical climates. Its fruits are edible and have a sweet, coconut-like flavor, making it valuable for both local consumption and commercial use. The plant also plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity in its habitat."
