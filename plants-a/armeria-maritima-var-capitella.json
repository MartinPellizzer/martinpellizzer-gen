    "intro": "Armeria maritima var. capitella, commonly known as sea thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features dense clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes, cliffs, and other harsh maritime environments. Its compact growth habit and hardy nature make it a popular choice for coastal landscaping and erosion control."
