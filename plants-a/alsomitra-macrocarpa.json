    "intro": "Alsomitra macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant orchid or giant alsomitra, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter, often in shades of pink and white. The plant produces long, pendant-like inflorescences that can grow up to 3 meters in length, making it a dramatic addition to gardens. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
