    "intro": "Aristolochia ornithopterae, commonly known as the birdwing arrowhead, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, aromatic leaves and distinctive, hooded flowers that resemble a pipe or a bird's beak. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow berries that contain toxic seeds, a trait common among members of the Aristolochiaceae family. Its unique floral structure is adapted for pollination by specific insects, such as flies and beetles. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
