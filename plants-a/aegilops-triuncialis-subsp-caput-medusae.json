    "intro": "Aegilops triuncialis subsp. caput-medusae, commonly known as the \"devil's wheat\" or \"false wheat,\" is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive, branched inflorescence that resembles a crown of thorns, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its seeds are small and enclosed in spikelets. This species is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement."
