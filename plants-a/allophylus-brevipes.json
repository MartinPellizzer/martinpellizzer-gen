    "intro": "Allophylus brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed alderleaf, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 2 to 4 meters and has simple, elliptical leaves that are often leathery in texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by spherical, fleshy fruits that contain several seeds. Its leaves are usually opposite or alternate, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded habitats. Allophylus brevipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its dense, compact growth habit."
