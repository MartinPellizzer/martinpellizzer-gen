    "intro": "Aegilops viridescens, commonly known as green wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
