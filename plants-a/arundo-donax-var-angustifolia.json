    "intro": "Arundo donax var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf giant reed, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are narrower than those of the typical Arundo donax. This variety grows in dense stands, often reaching heights of up to 6 meters. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as riverbanks and marshes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both an ecological pioneer and a potential invasive species in non-native regions."
