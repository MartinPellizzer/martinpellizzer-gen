    "intro": "Aechmea aculeatosepala, commonly known as the spiny-leafed bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding cup. The leaves are typically broad, stiff, and covered with sharp, spiny margins, which give the plant its common name. The plant produces striking inflorescences with colorful flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil and consistent moisture."
