    "intro": "Aster arenicola, commonly known as the sand aster, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, reducing water loss through transpiration. Aster arenicola plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
