    "intro": "Aconitum lycoctonum var. rerayense, commonly known as the Reray alpine monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps. It is characterized by its striking purple to blue flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and prefers partial to full shade, often found in rocky or alpine meadows. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care, as all parts of the plant contain potent alkaloids.",
