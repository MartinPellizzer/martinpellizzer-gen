    "intro": "Aizoon mezianum, commonly known as the Mezianum dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, enclosed in a fluffy, parachute-like structure. Aizoon mezianum is valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
