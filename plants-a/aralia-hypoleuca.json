    "intro": "Aralia hypoleuca, commonly known as white aralia, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves with a distinctive white or pale green coloration, which sets it apart from other aralia species. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and streamside areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking shade-tolerant plants."
