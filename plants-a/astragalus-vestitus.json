    "intro": "Astragalus vestitus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces cylindrical, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species in harsh environments. Astragalus vestitus plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
