    "intro": "Allophylus borbonicus, commonly known as the Madagascar alder, is a small evergreen tree native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, spherical fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
