    "intro": "Agropyron \u00d7 elymoides, commonly known as the intermediate wheatgrass, is a hybrid perennial grass native to the northern Great Plains of North America. It is a cross between Agropyron cristatum (crested wheatgrass) and Agropyron dasycladum (dasycladus wheatgrass), resulting in a plant with enhanced adaptability to various environmental conditions. The plant features dense, tufted growth with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is valued for its forage quality, erosion control, and potential as a bioenergy crop. Its botanical characteristics make it a key species in ecological restoration and sustainable agriculture."
