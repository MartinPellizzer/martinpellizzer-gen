    "intro": "Aulomyrcia pallens var. ovata, commonly known as the oval-leafed alderleaf, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myricaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often green or yellowish in color, which develop into woody, cone-like structures. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in swampy or riparian areas. This variant is distinguished by its ovate leaf shape, which sets it apart from the typical form of Aulomyrcia pallens."
