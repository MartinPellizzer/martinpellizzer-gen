    "intro": "Aceras densiflorum f. bifidum, commonly known as the bifid bellflower, is a rare and striking variant of the bellflower species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive, bifid (two-lobed) petals that give it a unique appearance compared to the typical single-lipped flowers of its species. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in sunny, well-drained habitats. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of vibrant blue or violet flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered plant in its native range.",
