    "intro": "Astragalus marcusjonesii, commonly known as Marcus Jones' milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its survival in harsh environments. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
