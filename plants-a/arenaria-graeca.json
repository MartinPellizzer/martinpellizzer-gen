    "intro": "Arenaria graeca, commonly known as Greek sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically thrives in rocky, sandy, and well-drained soils, often found in coastal and alpine environments. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Arenaria graeca is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
