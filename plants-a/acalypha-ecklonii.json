    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha ecklonii is primarily native to the Cape Provinces and Namibia. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in coastal and inland desert environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife. Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific regions in southern Africa.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha ecklonii was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions. It has since been reported in several regions across the country, particularly in areas with mild climates and well-drained soils. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative means have raised concerns about its potential to become invasive. Despite its ornamental value, its establishment in natural ecosystems has led to monitoring efforts to assess its impact on native flora. Proper management and control measures are recommended to prevent its spread in non-target environments."
