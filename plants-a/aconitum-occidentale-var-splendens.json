    "intro": "Aconitum occidentale var. splendens, commonly known as the Western monkshood or splendid aconite, is a striking perennial plant native to the western United States. It features large, showy blue to purple flowers arranged in a spire-like cluster, which are typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are deeply cut, giving it a distinctive and elegant appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic nature, it should be handled with care and is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value.",
