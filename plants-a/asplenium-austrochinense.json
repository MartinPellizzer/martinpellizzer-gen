    "intro": "Asplenium austrochinense, commonly known as the southern China spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit with dark green, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves, typically near the margins. Asplenium austrochinense is native to Southeast Asia, including parts of China, India, and the Philippines."
