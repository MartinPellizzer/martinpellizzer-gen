    "intro": "Agrimonia major, commonly known as great agrimony, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the rose family (Rosaceae) and is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits called achenes, which are enclosed in a pappus of bristles, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Agrimonia major is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
