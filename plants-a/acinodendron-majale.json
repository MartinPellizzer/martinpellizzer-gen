    "intro": "Acinodendron majale, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, which is why it is sometimes referred to as the \"milk tree.\" The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions.",
