    "intro": "Ambrosia porcheri, commonly known as Porcher's ragweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Its pollen is a significant allergen, contributing to seasonal hay fever in affected regions. The species is named in honor of the botanist George Porcher, who made notable contributions to the study of North American flora."
