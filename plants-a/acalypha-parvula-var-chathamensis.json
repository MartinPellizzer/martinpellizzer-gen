    "intro": "Acalypha parvula var. chathamensis, commonly known as the Chatham Island false nettle, is a small shrub native to the Chatham Islands of New Zealand. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually smooth or slightly hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by three-lobed, papery bracts that give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in coastal habitats and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native environment. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species.",

This rare variant of the species is found exclusively in the unique ecosystems of this archipelago. It thrives in the volcanic soils and varied microclimates of the islands. The plant is adapted to the specific environmental conditions of the Gal\u00e1pagos, making it an important part of the local flora. Its limited distribution highlights its ecological significance and vulnerability.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha parvula var. chathamensis was mainly introduced to New Zealand, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, particularly in the Chatham Islands. This plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often associated with human-modified environments. Its introduction is believed to have occurred through accidental transport by humans, likely as a contaminant in soil or plant material. Due to its adaptability, it has spread beyond its original introduction sites, raising concerns about its ecological impact."
