    "intro": "Acacia triphylla var. pungens, commonly known as the spiny wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance. The plant's thorn-like structures provide protection against herbivores.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia triphylla var. pungens is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia, particularly in the states of Western Australia, South Australia, and parts of the Northern Territory. This variety is commonly found in sandy soils and rocky outcrops, thriving in environments with low rainfall and high temperatures. It is often seen in shrublands and woodlands, where it contributes to the local biodiversity. The plant is well adapted to harsh conditions, showcasing its resilience in native Australian ecosystems. Its distribution is closely tied to the specific climatic and geological features of these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia triphylla var. pungens was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas, particularly in the Western and Eastern Cape provinces. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is often seen along roadsides and in disturbed habitats. Its introduction has led to its spread beyond its original range, contributing to local biodiversity. However, it is not considered invasive in most areas where it is established."
