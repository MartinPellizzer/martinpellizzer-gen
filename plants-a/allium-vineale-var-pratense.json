    "intro": "Allium vineale var. pratense, commonly known as garlic chives, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are aromatic and often used in culinary applications. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its bulbous structures are similar to garlic but are typically smaller and more delicate. This variety is often cultivated for both its edible leaves and ornamental value in gardens."
