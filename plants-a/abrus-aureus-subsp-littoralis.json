    "intro": "Abrus aureus subsp. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal velvet tamarind, is a perennial shrub native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow-orange flowers and bean-like, toxic seeds enclosed in red pods. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces a strong, unpleasant odor, which may deter herbivores. Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care.",

This subspecies is commonly found along coastal areas and sandy soils in the eastern and southern regions of the island. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in disturbed or open habitats. The plant is known for its distinctive red seeds enclosed in a showy, bean-like pod. Its distribution is largely restricted to the native range of Madagascar, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrus aureus subsp. littoralis was mainly introduced to coastal and estuarine environments along the eastern and southern coasts of Australia. It thrives in saline and brackish soils, often colonizing areas with high water tables and tidal influence. This subspecies is commonly found in mangrove swamps, salt marshes, and estuarine margins, where it plays a role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms. Its introduction has been associated with both natural dispersal and human activities such as land modification and coastal development. However, its impact on native ecosystems remains largely understudied."
