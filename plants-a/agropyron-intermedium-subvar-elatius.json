    "intro": "Agropyron intermedium subvar. elatius, commonly known as the tall wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are typically 30\u2013100 cm in height. The plant produces spikelets that are arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, with each spikelet containing several small, two-lobed florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairies, disturbed sites, and along roadsides. This species is valued for its erosion control capabilities and is also used in forage and soil stabilization efforts."
