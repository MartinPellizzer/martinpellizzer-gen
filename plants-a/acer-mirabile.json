    "intro": "Acer mirabile, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its ornamental value, featuring delicate, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The tree typically grows to a height of 6\u201315 meters, with a spreading, rounded canopy. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring. The bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is well-suited to moist, well-drained soils.",
