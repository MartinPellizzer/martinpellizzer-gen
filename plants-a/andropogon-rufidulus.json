    "intro": "Andropogon rufidulus, commonly known as purple bluestem, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its coarse, upright stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves that turn reddish in color during the fall. This perennial plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and prairie habitats. Its flowering spikes appear in late summer, producing small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind. Andropogon rufidulus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
