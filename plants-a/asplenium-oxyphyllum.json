    "intro": "Asplenium oxyphyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its slender, dark green fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Asplenium oxyphyllum is native to regions of southern Africa and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
