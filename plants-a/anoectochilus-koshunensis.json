    "intro": "Anoectochilus koshunensis, commonly known as the Koshun mountain orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers with a distinctive, narrow lip that is often marked with purple or reddish veins. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is typically found growing in shaded forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
