    "intro": "Aristolochia clavidenia, commonly known as the purple pipevine, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, purple-tinged leaves and its unique, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-white with a strong, musky scent. The plant belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is known for its complex morphology, including tendrils that aid in climbing. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and the plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic to most animals but serve as a defense mechanism. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
