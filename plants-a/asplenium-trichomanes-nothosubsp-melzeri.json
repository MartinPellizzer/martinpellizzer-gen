    "intro": "Asplenium trichomanes nothosubsp. melzeri, commonly known as the Melzer's maidenhair fern, is a rare hybrid species within the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in rocky or wooded areas. It has small, spore-producing structures called sori that are located on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and unique genetic makeup, it is considered a valuable subject in botanical research."
