    "intro": "Austrocactus hibernus subsp. robustior, commonly known as the robust desert cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of South America. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, spiny areoles, which help protect it from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to absorb moisture from the soil efficiently. This subspecies is adapted to extreme drought conditions and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils."
