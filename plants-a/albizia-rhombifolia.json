    "intro": "Albizia rhombifolia, commonly known as the African mimosa, is a leguminous shrub or small tree native to Africa. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are often fern-like in appearance, and its showy, pink or white flower clusters. The plant produces flat, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savannas and woodlands. Albizia rhombifolia is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment."
