It is characterized by its dark, almost sooty-colored foliage and slender, erect growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairies and open woodlands. Its botanical features make it an important component of native grassland ecosystems."
