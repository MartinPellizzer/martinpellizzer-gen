    "intro": "Acantholimon austroiranicum, commonly known as the Persian sandthorn, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its small, spiny leaves provide protection against herbivores and reduce water loss through transpiration. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and valuable species in its native habitat.",

It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often in mountainous areas. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Iran. It is a rare species with a restricted native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon austroiranicum was mainly introduced to regions with a temperate climate and well-drained soils, particularly in the Mediterranean basin and parts of southern Europe. It thrives in sunny, open habitats such as rocky slopes and gravelly soils. This plant is often found in disturbed areas and can tolerate moderate drought conditions. Its introduction has been associated with both natural dispersal and human activities like gardening and landscaping. However, it is considered a non-invasive species in most regions where it is established."
