    "intro": "Acer insigne f. velutinum, commonly known as the velvet maple, is a variant of the Pacific silver fir, characterized by its soft, velvety texture on the leaves. It is native to the western regions of the United States, particularly California, where it thrives in moist, shady environments. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a dark green upper surface. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value, especially during the autumn when the foliage turns vibrant shades of red and orange. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes.",
