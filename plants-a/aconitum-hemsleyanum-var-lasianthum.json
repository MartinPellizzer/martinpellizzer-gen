    "intro": "Aconitum hemsleyanum var. lasianthum, commonly known as the Hemsley's monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Himalayas. It features striking blue to purple flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape, typical of the genus Aconitum. The plant has dark green, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for use in gardens with children or pets.",
