    "intro": "Agrostis sozanensis, commonly known as the Sozan grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Agrostis sozanensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is of interest to botanists studying high-altitude flora."
