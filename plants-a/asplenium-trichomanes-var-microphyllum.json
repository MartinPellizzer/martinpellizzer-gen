    "intro": "Asplenium trichomanes var. microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaf rock spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and small, lanceolate leaves that are densely packed along the stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, often on limestone or other calcareous substrates. Its fronds are usually short and dark green, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in its preferred habitat. This variety is notable for its adaptability to moist, shaded conditions and its role in ecological succession in rocky habitats."
