It features broad, dark green, glossy leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Aucuba himalaica is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
