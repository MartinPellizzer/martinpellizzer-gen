    "intro": "Artemisia camphorata var. platyloba, commonly known as Chinese mugwort, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It is characterized by its gray-green, aromatic foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. Its leaves contain volatile oils, giving it a strong, camphor-like scent. This variety is closely related to other Artemisia species and is valued for its medicinal and aromatic properties."
