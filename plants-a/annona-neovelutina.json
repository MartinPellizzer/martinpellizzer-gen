    "intro": "Annona neovelutina, commonly known as the velvet annona, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture, which contribute to its common name. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow and are followed by edible, pear-shaped fruits. The fruit has a smooth, thin skin and a sweet, creamy pulp, making it a valuable food source in its native habitat."
