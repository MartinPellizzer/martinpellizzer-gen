    "intro": "Asarum versicolor var. non-versicolor, commonly known as the non-versicolor variety of the yellow woodruff, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, clustered flowers that range from white to pale yellow. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rich, loamy soils. It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, with sepals that are often more prominent than the petals. This variant is less variable in color compared to the typical *A. versicolor*, making it a distinct but less commonly cultivated form."
