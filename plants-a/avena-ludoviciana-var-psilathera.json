    "intro": "Avena ludoviciana var. psilathera, commonly known as the slender oat, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and open habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native wildlife."
