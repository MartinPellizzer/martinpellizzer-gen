    "intro": "Artemisia dalmatica, commonly known as western wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their antiseptic and digestive properties. Artemisia dalmatica is also a valuable plant in ecological restoration due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
