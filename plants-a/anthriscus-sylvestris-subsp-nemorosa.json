    "intro": "Anthriscus sylvestris subsp. nemorosa, commonly known as wood anise, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white, umbel-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its name reflects its association with wooded areas and its resemblance to the related plant, anise."
