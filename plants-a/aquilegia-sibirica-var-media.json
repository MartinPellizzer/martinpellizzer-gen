It features showy, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple, with five petals arranged in a bell shape. The plant has compound leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces bright red or orange seed pods that burst open to disperse seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early spring bloom and ability to attract pollinators."
