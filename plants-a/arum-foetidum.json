    "intro": "Arum foetidum, commonly known as the stinkplant, is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It features a distinctive, arrow-shaped leaf that can grow up to 1 meter in length, with a deep green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. The plant produces a spadix, a spiky structure surrounded by a showy, purple to green spathe, which is typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps and along the edges of ponds. The plant is notable for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is released from the spadix and attracts pollinators such as flies."
