    "intro": "Adiantum \u00d7 moranii, commonly known as the moonlight fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Adiantum capillus-veneris and Adiantum venustum. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green to silvery-white in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, moist soil. Its fronds are bi-lobed and often droop gracefully, giving it an ethereal appearance. Adiantum \u00d7 moranii is a popular ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical gardens due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of care.",
