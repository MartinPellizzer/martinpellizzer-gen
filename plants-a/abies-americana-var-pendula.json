    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies americana var. pendula is primarily native to the eastern United States, including parts of New York, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey. This variety is typically found in moist, well-drained soils in mixed hardwood forests. It grows in regions with a temperate climate and is often associated with mountainous areas. The plant thrives in areas with ample sunlight and moderate temperatures. It is a rare and distinctive form of the American fir, known for its drooping branches.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies americana var. pendula was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its unique weeping form and aesthetic appeal. It is commonly used in gardens and parks to add visual interest and create a dramatic focal point. This variety is preferred for its slow growth rate and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. However, it is important to note that it may pose a risk of becoming invasive in certain environments if not properly managed. Its introduction has expanded its range beyond its native habitat in the northeastern United States."
