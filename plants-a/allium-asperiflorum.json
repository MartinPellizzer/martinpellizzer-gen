    "intro": "Allium asperiflorum, commonly known as the roughflower garlic, is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and striking, spherical inflorescences that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant is native to southern Europe and western Asia, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense clusters, with each bloom having six tepals that are often adorned with a distinctive waxy coating. Allium asperiflorum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is relatively low maintenance once established."
