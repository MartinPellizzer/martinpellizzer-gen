    "intro": "Artemisia flavifolia, commonly known as the yellowleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in dry, well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves contain volatile oils, which contribute to its distinctive scent and medicinal properties. Artemisia flavifolia is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported antiseptic and anti-inflammatory benefits."
