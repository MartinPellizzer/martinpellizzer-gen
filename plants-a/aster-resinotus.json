    "intro": "Aster resinotus, commonly known as the resinous aster, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces a sticky, resinous substance from its stems and leaves, which gives it its common name. Its flowers are typically blue to purple in color and bloom in the late summer to early fall. Aster resinotus is often found in moist, woodlands and thrives in partial to full shade."
