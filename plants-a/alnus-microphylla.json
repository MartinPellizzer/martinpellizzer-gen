    "intro": "Alnus microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved alder, is a deciduous tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The tree produces catkin-like flowers and is often found growing near water sources such as streams and wetlands. Its bark is smooth and gray, and it has a shallow root system that helps stabilize soil. Alnus microphylla plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life."
