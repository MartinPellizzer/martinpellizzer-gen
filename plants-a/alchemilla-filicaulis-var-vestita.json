    "intro": "Alchemilla filicaulis var. vestita, commonly known as the velvetleaf lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of silky, white hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and ability to form dense ground cover."
