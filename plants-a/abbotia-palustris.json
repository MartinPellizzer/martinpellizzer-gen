    "intro": "Abbotia palustris, commonly known as the swamp abbotia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It features striking, showy white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its unique floral structure and habitat preferences make it an important species for wetland ecosystems.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abbotia palustris is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia. It thrives in wetland environments such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This plant is commonly found in areas with consistently moist to saturated soils. It is often associated with the Florida scrub ecosystem but can also be found in other wetland habitats. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abbotia palustris was mainly introduced to wetland and riparian areas where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is commonly found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This plant is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality. Its introduction has helped in reclaiming degraded wetland habitats in various regions. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological imbalances."
