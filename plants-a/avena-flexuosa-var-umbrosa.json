    "intro": "Avena flexuosa var. umbrosa, commonly known as the shaded oatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to moist, shaded environments. It features slender, arching stems that often form dense mats, with narrow, grass-like leaves that have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides habitat for various invertebrates. Its ecological role is significant in maintaining the biodiversity of shaded, mesic ecosystems."
