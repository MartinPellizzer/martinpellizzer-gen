    "intro": "Athyrium woodwardioides, commonly known as the Japanese maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a rosette of fiddlehead-like spore-bearing fronds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
