    "intro": "Agrostis mildbraedii, commonly known as the mildbraed\u2019s bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassland and wetland habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny seeds. It is characterized by its dense growth habit and ability to form mats, which helps in soil stabilization. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
