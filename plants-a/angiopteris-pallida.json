    "intro": "Angiopteris pallida, commonly known as the pale fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green fronds that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is known for its intricate, lace-like leaf structures. Angiopteris pallida typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its unique botanical appearance."
