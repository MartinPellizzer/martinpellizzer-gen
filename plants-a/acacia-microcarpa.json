    "intro": "Acacia microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Acacia microcarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand drought conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia microcarpa is primarily native to New South Wales, South Australia, and Victoria. It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands, grasslands, and along roadsides. This species is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of these regions. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various native animals. Its distribution reflects its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand periods of drought.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia microcarpa was mainly introduced to South Africa for its ornamental value and potential for soil stabilization. It is commonly found in coastal and inland regions, particularly in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping due to its attractive foliage and drought tolerance. However, it has also been noted to spread aggressively, posing a threat to native vegetation in some areas. Its introduction has led to both ecological and economic impacts, depending on the region."
