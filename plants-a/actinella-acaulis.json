    "intro": "Actinella acaulis, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It forms dense, compact cushions of foliage that help it retain moisture and resist harsh environmental conditions. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often hidden among the foliage. Actinella acaulis is well adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.",
