    "intro": "Arctium ugamense, commonly known as the common burdock, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed. The plant produces purple to pink flower heads, which are surrounded by bracts that form the distinctive bur-like structures. These burs contain hooked seeds that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals or clothing. Native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
