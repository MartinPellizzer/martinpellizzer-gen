    "intro": "Alchemilla urceolata, commonly known as the spoonwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of silver-green leaves that form a rosette at the base. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in compact inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Alchemilla urceolata is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and its ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
