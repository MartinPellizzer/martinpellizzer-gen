It features showy, clustered flowers in shades of white, violet, and blue, which bloom from late summer to early fall. The foliage is typically gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden borders and containers. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees."
