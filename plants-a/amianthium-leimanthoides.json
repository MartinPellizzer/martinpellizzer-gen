    "intro": "Amianthium leimanthoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf marsh clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces strobili, or cone-like structures, which contain the sporangia that release spores for reproduction. Its morphology reflects adaptations to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, with a low-growing habit that helps it thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Amianthium leimanthoides plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and is an indicator species for certain types of wetlands."
