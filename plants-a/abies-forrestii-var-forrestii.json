The plant is commonly found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,000 meters. Its native distribution is closely tied to the specific ecological conditions of these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies forrestii var. forrestii was mainly introduced to North America and Europe as an ornamental plant due to its attractive conical shape and evergreen foliage. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. This variety is known for its slow growth and resistance to pests and diseases, making it a popular choice for landscaping. However, it has raised concerns in some regions due to its potential to become invasive in natural habitats. Its introduction has led to increased efforts in monitoring and managing its spread to protect native ecosystems."
