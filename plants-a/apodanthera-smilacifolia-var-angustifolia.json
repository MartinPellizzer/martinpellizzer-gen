    "intro": "Apodanthera smilacifolia var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf apodanthera, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It features slender, wiry stems that can reach several meters in length, often twining around supports. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, with a smooth margin and a glossy dark green upper surface. Small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters, followed by small, fleshy berries that are edible but not widely cultivated. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in shaded, humid environments."
