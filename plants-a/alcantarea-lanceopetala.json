    "intro": "Alcantarea lanceopetala, commonly known as the lanceleaf puya, is a striking bromeliad native to the coastal regions of Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces vibrant, spikelike inflorescences with showy red or orange flowers, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bats. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value, and it thrives in well-drained soil with bright, indirect light. Alcantarea lanceopetala is a popular choice for tropical gardens and indoor collections due to its dramatic appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
