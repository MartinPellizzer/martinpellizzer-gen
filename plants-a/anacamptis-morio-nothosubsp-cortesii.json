    "intro": "Anacamptis morio nothosubsp. cortesii, commonly known as the Cortesii Orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a terrestrial herb with a sympodial growth habit, characterized by a short rhizome and a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single spike bearing several pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with prominent purple markings. It thrives in calcareous soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
