    "intro": "Abutilon sandwicense, commonly known as the Kona abutilon, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in coastal areas, characterized by its hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. It is adapted to the dry, sunny conditions of its native habitat and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky slopes. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range.",
