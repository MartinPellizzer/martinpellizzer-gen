    "intro": "Andropogon incompletus, commonly known as the incomplete grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are often hidden among the foliage. Andropogon incompletus plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
