    "intro": "Areca nobilis, commonly known as the betel nut palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible, round fruits containing a hard, starchy seed. The leaves are often used in traditional practices, while the seeds are cultivated for their nut-like fruit. Areca nobilis thrives in warm, humid climates and is often grown for its ornamental value as well as its economic importance."
