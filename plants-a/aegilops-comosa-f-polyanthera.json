It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of climates. Its inflorescence features multiple flowering branches, which distinguish it from the typical form of Aegilops comosa. This form is often studied for its genetic traits and potential agricultural applications."
