    "intro": "Allium decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive onion, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs are often mistaken for true onions due to their similar appearance, hence the common name. Allium decipiens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes grown in gardens for its visual interest."
