    "intro": "Amanoa cupatensis, commonly known as the Kauai bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest habitats, often found in the understory of native Hawaiian forests. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a glossy texture, while its flowers bloom in clusters. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, Amanoa cupatensis is considered endangered and is a focus of conservation efforts in Hawaii."
