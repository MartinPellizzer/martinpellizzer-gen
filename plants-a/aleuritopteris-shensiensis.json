    "intro": "Aleuritopteris shensiensis, commonly known as the Sichuan water fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent in certain conditions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Aleuritopteris shensiensis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
