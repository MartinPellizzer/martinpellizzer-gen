It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the island, particularly in the southern and southwestern parts. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to the dry climate of its native habitat. It is a member of the Fabaceae family and is known for its distinctive silvery foliage. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species to Madagascar.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrahamia sericea was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in coastal regions. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, dunes, and sandy soils. This plant thrives in environments with moderate to high salinity, making it adaptable to coastal ecosystems. Its introduction has been noted in several states along the Pacific coast of North America. However, its spread is limited by its specific soil and climate requirements."
