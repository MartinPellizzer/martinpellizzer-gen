It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic fern that typically grows on rocks or trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Aspidium sancti-pauli is native to regions in Asia, including parts of China, Japan, and the Indian subcontinent."
