    "intro": "Acanthobotrya, commonly known as the thorned milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apocynaceae. These plants are characterized by their milky sap, which is often toxic and serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Acanthobotrya species typically have simple, opposite leaves and produce showy, tubular flowers in various colors, including yellow, orange, and red. They are native to regions in Africa and are often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The genus is noted for its ecological importance, particularly in supporting certain species of insects and birds."
