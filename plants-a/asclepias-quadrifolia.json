    "intro": "Asclepias quadrifolia, commonly known as the four-leaf milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, opposite leaves that are heart-shaped and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with five petals and a distinctive horned structure at the center. It is a critical host plant for the endangered monarch butterfly, providing food for both larvae and adult insects. Its medicinal properties have also been historically recognized by Native American tribes."
