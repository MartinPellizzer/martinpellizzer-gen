    "intro": "Ajuga nipponensis var. pallescens, commonly known as the pale ajuga, is a low-growing perennial groundcover native to Japan. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a silvery-green color. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom in early to mid-summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and long blooming period."
