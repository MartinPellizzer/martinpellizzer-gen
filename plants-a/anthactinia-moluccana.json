    "intro": "Anthactinia moluccana, commonly known as the Moluccan starfish plant, is a unique succulent native to the Maluku Islands in Indonesia. It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its star-shaped, fleshy leaves that resemble the arms of a starfish. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, waxy leaves to survive periods of drought. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months, adding a delicate touch to its rugged appearance. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
