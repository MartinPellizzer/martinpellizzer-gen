    "intro": "Acacia dissona var. dissona, commonly known as the slender wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, feathery leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical clusters, which are typically visited by various pollinators. It is well adapted to dry and arid conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. The wood of Acacia dissona var. dissona is strong and durable, historically used by Indigenous Australians for tool-making.",

This plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. It is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. Its distribution is closely associated with sandy soils and coastal areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia dissona var. dissona was mainly introduced to areas with a warm, dry climate and well-drained soils, often in regions with low rainfall. It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas where it can tolerate high salinity and sandy soils. This plant is often used for erosion control and as a windbreak due to its hardy nature. It has also been introduced as an ornamental plant because of its distinctive foliage and ability to thrive in challenging environments. Its distribution is largely limited to regions where it can establish itself without significant competition from native vegetation."
