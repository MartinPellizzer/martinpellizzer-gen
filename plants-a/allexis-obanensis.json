    "intro": "Allexis obanensis, commonly known as the Oban alpine bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the Scottish Highlands. It is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late summer. The plant thrives in alpine environments, growing in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. It has small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Allexis obanensis is considered a vulnerable species."
