    "intro": "Astranthium integrifolium var. triflorum, commonly known as the three-flowered thornweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This species is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
