It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Amphiachyris dracunculoides is well-suited to arid and saline environments, making it a hardy plant for coastal landscaping."
