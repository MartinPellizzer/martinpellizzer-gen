    "intro": "Azorella crenata var. mutisiana, commonly known as the Andean stonecress, is a low-growing evergreen plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers during the summer months, and its leaves are typically covered in a thick layer of fine, woolly hair. Azorella crenata var. mutisiana is adapted to cold, arid conditions and can thrive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is often used in traditional medicine by local communities."
