    "intro": "Adiantum obtusum var. kunzei, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are broad at the base and taper towards the tips. The plant produces delicate, spore-bearing sori on the underside of its fronds, which are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.",
