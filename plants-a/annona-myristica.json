    "intro": "Annona myristica, commonly known as custard apple, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It produces a distinctive fruit with a rough, green exterior and a sweet, creamy white pulp that resembles custard. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually heart-shaped and have a velvety texture. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in umbels, often appearing before the fruit. The fruit is typically harvested when it is fully ripe, characterized by a change in color and a soft, fragrant texture."
