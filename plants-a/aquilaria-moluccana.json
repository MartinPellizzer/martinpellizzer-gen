    "intro": "Aquilaria moluccana, commonly known as the agarwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thymelaeaceae and is characterized by its aromatic resinous wood, which is highly valued in perfumery and traditional medicine. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall and has glossy, elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, and it produces woody fruits containing three to four seeds. The resin, known as oud or agar, is secreted in response to fungal infections and is the primary reason for its economic importance."
