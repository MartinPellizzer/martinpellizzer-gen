    "intro": "Astragalus subrobustus, commonly known as the robust milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow to greenish-yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. Astragalus subrobustus is often found in grasslands, deserts, and along rocky slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
