    "intro": "Aspidosperma molle, commonly known as the white cedar, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves that are typically opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy fruits containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Botanically, it is notable for its ability to tolerate drought and its historical use in traditional medicine."
