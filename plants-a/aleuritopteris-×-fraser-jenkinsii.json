    "intro": "Aleuritopteris \u00d7 fraser-jenkinsii, commonly known as the Fraser-Jenkins huperzia, is a hybrid fern that combines traits from Aleuritopteris and Huperzia. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various garden settings."
