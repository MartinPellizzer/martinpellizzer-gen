    "intro": "Asplenium camptocarpon, commonly known as the curled spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are often curled or twisted. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in shaded forest floors. Asplenium camptocarpon is a hardy species that is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
