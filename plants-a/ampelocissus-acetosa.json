    "intro": "Ampelocissus acetosa, commonly known as the sour fig or sour vine, is a woody vine native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and distinctive, opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, sour-tasting berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Ampelocissus acetosa is also valued as a decorative plant in gardens due to its attractive foliage and cascading form."
