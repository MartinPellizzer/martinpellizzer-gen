    "intro": "Ankylobus hamosus, commonly known as the hairy beggar-tick, is a flowering plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has slender, hairy stems and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. Its leaves are alternate, often lobed, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Ankylobus hamosus is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain regions."
