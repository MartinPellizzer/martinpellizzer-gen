    "intro": "Aconitum napellus subsp. pyramidale, commonly known as the Italian monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Alps and parts of southern Europe. It features striking, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers that are arranged in a tall, sparsely branched inflorescence. The plant has palmately lobed leaves with a distinctive, waxy texture and a strong, toxic scent. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.",
