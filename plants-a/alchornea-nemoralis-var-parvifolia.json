    "intro": "Alchornea nemoralis var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved alchornea, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features simple, ovate leaves that are typically smaller than those of the typical variety, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in woodland edges and rocky soils, preferring partial shade to full sun. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological studies and habitat diversity."
