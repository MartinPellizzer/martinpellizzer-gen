    "intro": "Alnus incana var. ovata, commonly known as the oval-leaf gray alder, is a variant of the gray alder native to the western United States. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streams and in mountainous regions. The plant has slender, zigzagging branches and is characterized by its oval-shaped, gray-green leaves. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and improve soil quality."
