    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer dasycarpum var. pendulum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China, particularly in the provinces of Sichuan, Hubei, and Shaanxi. It thrives in temperate climates with high altitudes, often found in mixed forests and on rocky slopes. This variety is known for its distinctive weeping growth habit, which makes it a striking ornamental plant. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for cultivation in cooler regions. The plant's natural range is limited, reflecting its adaptation to specific ecological conditions in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer dasycarpum var. pendulum was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its unique weeping growth habit and aesthetic appeal. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and parks for its visual interest throughout the growing season. The plant is well-suited for temperate climates and can thrive in a variety of soil types with adequate drainage. Its introduction has expanded its presence in both private and public green spaces across regions with suitable growing conditions. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native environments."
