    "intro": "Aster leucocappus, commonly known as the silver aster, is a perennial herb native to New Zealand. It features striking white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has a robust root system and hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine silvery down. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open forest and shrubland habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it is considered rare in the wild."
