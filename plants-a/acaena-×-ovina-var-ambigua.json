    "intro": "Acaena \u00d7 ovina var. ambigua, commonly known as the New Zealand bracken or bracken fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae and is characterized by its fern-like fronds and spore-bearing structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along streambanks. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a coarse texture, while its spores are released from specialized clusters called sori. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.",

It is found in the northern and central regions of the country, including the North Island and parts of the South Island. This variant is commonly associated with coastal and lowland environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as dunes and grasslands. The plant is part of the bramble family and is known for its distinctive spiny structures.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena \u00d7 ovina var. ambigua was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of early European colonization efforts. The plant was likely cultivated for its ornamental value or as a potential agricultural crop. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native flora. Its distribution is now widespread across various habitats in New Zealand."
