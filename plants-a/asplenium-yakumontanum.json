    "intro": "Asplenium yakumontanum, commonly known as the Yakumontan spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often clustered at the base, with a short, creeping rhizome. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. This species is native to Australia and is often found in the rainforests of the eastern and northern regions of the country."
