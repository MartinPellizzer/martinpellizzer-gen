    "intro": "Armeria seticeps, commonly known as the sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant with dense clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to stabilize sandy or gravelly soils. Armeria seticeps is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh maritime conditions."
