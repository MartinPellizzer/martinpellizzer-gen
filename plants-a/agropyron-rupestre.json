    "intro": "Agropyron rupestre, commonly known as the Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate and arctic regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps it thrive in poor soils and harsh climates. The plant produces spikelets that are often tinged with purple, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is well adapted to cold environments and can tolerate drought conditions. Agropyron rupestre is also valued for its use in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
