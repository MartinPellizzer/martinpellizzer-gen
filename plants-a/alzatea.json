    "intro": "Alzatea, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and includes several species that are valued for their ornamental and medicinal properties. The plants typically have opposite leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, often with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Alzatea species produce small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pink, followed by small, round fruits. These plants thrive in tropical and subtropical climates and are often found in moist, shaded environments."
