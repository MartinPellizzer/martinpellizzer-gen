    "intro": "Artemisia besseriana, commonly known as the Siberian wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the cold climates of Eastern Europe and Western Siberia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open areas such as grasslands and forest edges. Artemisia besseriana contains various volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its medicinal and aromatic properties. It is also used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic effects."
