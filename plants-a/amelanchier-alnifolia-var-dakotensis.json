    "intro": "Amelanchier alnifolia var. dakotensis, commonly known as the Dakota serviceberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the central United States. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 12 feet and features opposite, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet berries in late summer. Its small, persistent fruits are an important food source for birds and wildlife. The Dakota serviceberry is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open woodlands and prairie edges."
