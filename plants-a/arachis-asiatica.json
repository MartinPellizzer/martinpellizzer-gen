It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its erect, herbaceous growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by pod-like fruits containing one to three seeds. Arachis asiatica is adapted to warm, tropical climates and is often cultivated for its edible seeds. It is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
