This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested or open areas. The species is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage. Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to the warm and humid climates of southern China and neighboring regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon sinense was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowers. It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas in countries such as Australia, the United States, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative propagation have led to its establishment in some native ecosystems. However, it is considered a potential invasive species in certain regions where it can outcompete native vegetation."
