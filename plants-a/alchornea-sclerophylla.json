    "intro": "Alchornea sclerophylla, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its hard, dense wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in spikes, followed by small, woody fruits. Alchornea sclerophylla is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in savannas and woodland areas."
