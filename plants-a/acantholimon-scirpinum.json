    "intro": "Acantholimon scirpinum, commonly known as the slender stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky and sandy soils of the Mediterranean region. It features small, fleshy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. The plant has succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, helping it retain moisture in arid environments. It is well adapted to coastal and inland areas with poor soil conditions. Acantholimon scirpinum is often found in dry grasslands, cliffs, and dunes, where it thrives in full sun.",

It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in mountainous areas. The plant is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. It is a part of the local flora in Iran's central and eastern regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon scirpinum was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or semi-arid regions. It thrives in well-drained environments and is commonly found in dunes, slopes, and disturbed areas. This plant is adapted to tolerate salt spray and harsh climatic conditions, making it suitable for coastal restoration projects. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of the Mediterranean and the western United States. Its distribution is largely influenced by human activity and habitat modification."
