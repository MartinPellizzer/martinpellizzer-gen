    "intro": "Allosorus lanuginosus, commonly known as the downy allosorus, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its fern-like fronds and umbellate inflorescence. It is native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, particularly in Europe and parts of Asia. The plant features finely hairy leaves that give it a soft, downy appearance, and its small white flowers are arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Allosorus lanuginosus is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
