It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant is adapted to cold, rocky environments and has a short growing season. It is often found in mountainous areas at elevations above 1,500 meters. The bulbous stem is edible and has a mild garlic flavor, making it a valued wild plant in some culinary traditions."
