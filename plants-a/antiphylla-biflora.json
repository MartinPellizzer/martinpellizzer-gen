    "intro": "Antiphylla biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered antiphylla, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant features small, pale pink or white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to its arid or semi-arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Antiphylla biflora is considered a vulnerable species."
