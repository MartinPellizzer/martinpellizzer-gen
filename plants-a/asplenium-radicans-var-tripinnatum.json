    "intro": "Asplenium radicans var. tripinnatum, commonly known as the creeping shield fern, is a varietal form of the shield fern, characterized by its distinctive fronds. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the ground or climb over other vegetation. Its fronds are typically bipinnate or tripinnate, giving the plant a delicate, feathery appearance. The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid conditions."
