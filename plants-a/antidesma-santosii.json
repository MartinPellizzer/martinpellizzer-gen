    "intro": "Antidesma santosii, commonly known as the Santosii antidesma, is a small evergreen shrub native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
