    "intro": "Astragalus maculatus, commonly known as the spotted milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Astragalus maculatus has small, rounded seeds that are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment. It is also sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive appearance."
