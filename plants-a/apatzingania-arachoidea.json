    "intro": "Apatzingania arachoidea, commonly known as the Mexican fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
