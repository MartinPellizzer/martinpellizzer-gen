    "intro": "Arctium thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's burdock, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces spiny, bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are thick and often reddish in color. Thomson's burdock is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as meadows and stream banks."
