    "intro": "Aspidium navarrense, commonly known as the Navarre fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green and finely divided. This plant is native to the Iberian Peninsula and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Aspidium navarrense has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces spores in small, clustered sori on the underside of its fronds. It plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystem."
