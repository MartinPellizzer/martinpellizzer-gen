    "intro": "Acacia undulifolia, commonly known as the wavy-leaf acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that have a wavy or undulating appearance, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow globular flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, attracting various pollinators. Acacia undulifolia is well adapted to drought and can thrive in poor soils, making it a resilient species in harsh environments. It is also valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in landscaping in suitable climates.",

This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in open woodlands and heathlands. It is well adapted to the dry and semi-arid climates of New South Wales. Acacia undulifolia plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia undulifolia was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils, particularly in the Western Cape. The plant is known for its distinctive wavy leaf margins and yellow flowers, which make it a popular ornamental species. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some parts of its range. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation."
