    "intro": "Anthurium maricense, commonly known as the Mar\u00edn Anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are typically deep green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces bright red spathes that enclose small, white spadices, which are the actual flowering structures. It thrives in humid, warm environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Anthurium maricense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
