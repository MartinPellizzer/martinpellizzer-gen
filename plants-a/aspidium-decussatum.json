    "intro": "Aspidium decussatum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arranged in a decussate pattern, meaning they cross each other in a staggered manner. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in wet forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce adventitious roots, allowing it to anchor itself in soil and absorb nutrients. Aspidium decussatum is known for its ability to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions, making it a common sight in freshwater habitats."
