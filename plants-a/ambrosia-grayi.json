    "intro": "Ambrosia grayi, commonly known as gray's ambrosia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Ambrosiaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in desert environments. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Ambrosia grayi is a perennial shrub that plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
