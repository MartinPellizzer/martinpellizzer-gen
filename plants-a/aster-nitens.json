    "intro": "Aster nitens, commonly known as the frost aster, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often appearing in late summer to early autumn. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cold temperatures. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Aster nitens plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is a symbol of resilience in alpine ecosystems."
