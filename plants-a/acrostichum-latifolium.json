    "intro": "Acrostichum latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf brake, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, compound leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its fronds are often divided into numerous small, finger-like segments called pinnae. The reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.",
