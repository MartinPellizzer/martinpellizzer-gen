    "intro": "Anthemis hirtella, commonly known as the hairy anthemis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its hairy stems and leaves are adaptations to its arid environment, helping to reduce water loss. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
