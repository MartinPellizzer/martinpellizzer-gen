    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. curtiloba, commonly known as broad-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with a rosette of basal leaves that are broad, spoon-shaped, and often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in branched clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are known for their ability to retain moisture, a characteristic that contributes to its resilience in various soil conditions. It is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in shady or partially sunny environments."
