It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and aromatic, lemon-scented leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported antiseptic and digestive properties. The flowering stems produce small, pale-green spikelets that are inconspicuous but essential for seed production."
