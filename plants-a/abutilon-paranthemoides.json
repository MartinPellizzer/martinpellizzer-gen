    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon paranthemoides is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is commonly found in lowland areas with well-drained soils. This plant is often associated with disturbed habitats such as roadsides, pastures, and forest edges. It is also cultivated in some regions for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowers. Its natural range extends into parts of Central America as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon paranthemoides was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in full sun to partial shade. It is commonly found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in urban environments due to its adaptability. This plant is often considered an invasive species in some regions because of its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds. Its distribution has been expanding in parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. However, it is less common in temperate regions where it may not establish itself successfully."
