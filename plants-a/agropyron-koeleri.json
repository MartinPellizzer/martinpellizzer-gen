    "intro": "Agropyron koeleri, commonly known as the Koeler's wheatgrasses, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and arctic environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
