    "intro": "Acrostichum virens var. crispatulum, commonly known as the curly fern, is a variant of the common brake fern. It is a perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions, characterized by its distinctive, wavy, and curled fronds. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forests or along stream banks. Its fronds are typically bright green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. The botanical features of this fern make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects.",
