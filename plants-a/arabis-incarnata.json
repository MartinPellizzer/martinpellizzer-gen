It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and clusters of small, pink or white flowers. It produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. Arabis incarnata is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and easy care requirements."
