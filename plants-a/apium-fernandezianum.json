    "intro": "Apium fernandezianum, commonly known as the Fernandez's celery, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like carrots and parsley. The plant is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and compound leaves with a feathery appearance. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within its native range."
