    "intro": "Acantholimon strictiforme, commonly known as the narrowleaf thrift, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its upright, branching stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant has needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species in dry climates. Acantholimon strictiforme is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.",

This plant is typically found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the Tien Shan range. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing on slopes and in alpine zones. The species is adapted to the cold and dry climate of its native habitat. It plays an important role in the local flora and is part of the unique biodiversity of Kirgizstan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon strictiforme was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It is commonly found in coastal scrub and sandy soils, often growing in disturbed areas. This plant is known for its upright growth habit and small, blue-gray foliage. It thrives in full sun and is adapted to dry, well-drained conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it has become a common invasive species in some regions."
