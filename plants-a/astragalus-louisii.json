    "intro": "Astragalus louisii, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has a deep root system that helps it survive in dry, sandy soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion. Astragalus louisii is also valued for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for various desert animals."
