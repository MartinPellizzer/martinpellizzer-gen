    "intro": "Agave brachystachys, commonly known as the blue agave, is a species native to Mexico. It is a succulent plant characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that form a rosette shape. The leaves are typically blue-gray in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces a tall flowering stalk that bears small, greenish-white flowers. This plant is widely cultivated for its sap, which is used in the production of tequila and other agave-based spirits."
