    "intro": "Astragalus schelichowii, commonly known as Schelichow's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists and ecologists. Its limited distribution makes it a subject of conservation concern in some areas."
