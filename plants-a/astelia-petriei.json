    "intro": "[WRONG START] Astelea petriei, commonly known as the Kauri fern, is a unique species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures consist of spore-bearing cones, and it plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
