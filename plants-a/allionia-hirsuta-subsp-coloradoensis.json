    "intro": "Allionia hirsuta subsp. coloradoensis, commonly known as the Colorado sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial with slender, often hairy stems and small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing nectar for pollinators."
