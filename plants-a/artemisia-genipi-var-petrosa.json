    "intro": "Artemisia genipi var. petrosa, commonly known as the Mexican tarragon, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and rocky gardens. Its essential oils, rich in compounds like thymol and camphor, contribute to its use in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb. The variety petrosa is distinguished by its more compact growth habit compared to other Artemisia species."
