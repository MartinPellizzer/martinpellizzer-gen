    "intro": "Amorpha pedalis, commonly known as the creeping false indigo, is a perennial legume native to the eastern United States. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers that are typically purple or blue in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its trifoliate leaves are alternate and have a soft, hairy texture. Amorpha pedalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
