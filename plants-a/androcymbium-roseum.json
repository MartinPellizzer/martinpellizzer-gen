    "intro": "Androcymbium roseum, commonly known as the rose-flowered orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features a slender, erect stem that bears several lance-shaped leaves with a glossy green surface. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically arranged in clusters at the top of the stem. Its flowers have a unique structure with a spurred lip that serves as a nectar source for pollinators. Androcymbium roseum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
