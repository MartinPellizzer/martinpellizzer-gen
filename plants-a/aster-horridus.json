It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy, rough-textured stems and leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, violet to blue-purple flowers in the fall. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. Aster horridus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
