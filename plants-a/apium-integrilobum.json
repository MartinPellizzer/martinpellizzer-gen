    "intro": "Apium integrilobum, commonly known as the broad-leaved parsley or wild carrot, is a biennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that are aromatic and often used in culinary applications. The plant produces small, white or greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the Apiaceae family. Its root is edible and resembles a carrot in appearance, though it is less commonly consumed than its domesticated counterpart. Apium integrilobum is also known for its medicinal properties, including potential anti-inflammatory and digestive benefits."
