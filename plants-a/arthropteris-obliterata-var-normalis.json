    "intro": "Arthropteris obliterata var. normalis, commonly known as the common sword fern, is a species of fern native to various regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both roots and new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
