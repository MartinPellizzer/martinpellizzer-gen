    "intro": "Aspidium subtriphyllum var. ebenosum, commonly known as the ebony spleenwort, is a fern species belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often glossy and have a distinctive, compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in shaded garden settings."
