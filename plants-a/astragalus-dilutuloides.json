    "intro": "Astragalus dilutuloides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus dilutuloides is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in soil stabilization and as a food source for native wildlife."
