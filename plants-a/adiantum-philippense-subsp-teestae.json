    "intro": "Adiantum philippense subsp. teestae, commonly known as the Philippine maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that resemble a feather. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent under certain conditions, though this is not a common trait. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance.",
