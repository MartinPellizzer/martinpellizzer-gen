    "intro": "Andropogon zizanioides, commonly known as common Johnsongrass, is a perennial grass native to the warm temperate and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, and its narrow, blade-like leaves with a prominent midrib. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which contain both male and female flowers, making it monoecious. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, often forming dense stands that can dominate agricultural and natural landscapes. It is an important species in the grass family Poaceae and is known for its adaptability to various soil types and environmental conditions."
