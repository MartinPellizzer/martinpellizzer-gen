    "intro": "Aleuritopteris parishii, commonly known as the Parry's cliff fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Aleuritopteris parishii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in horticultural settings."
