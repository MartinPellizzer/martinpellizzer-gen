    "intro": "Acer nambuanum, commonly known as the Nambu maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China and northern Vietnam. It is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas.",
