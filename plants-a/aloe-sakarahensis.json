    "intro": "Aloe sakarahensis, commonly known as the Sakaraha aloe, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Asphodelaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are thick and fleshy. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow-orange flowers, which bloom during the dry season. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that is similar to other aloe species, though it is less commonly used in commercial products. Aloe sakarahensis is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water to survive."
