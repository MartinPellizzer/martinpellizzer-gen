    "intro": "Aristeguietia diplodictyon, commonly known as the Andean orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, often fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the cool, misty conditions of its high-altitude habitat. Its leaves are usually elongated and covered in a fine, soft pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
