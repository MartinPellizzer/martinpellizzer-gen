    "intro": "Arundo solida, commonly known as solid reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It features stiff, hollow stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height, making it a striking plant in gardens and landscapes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in coastal areas and rocky soils. Solid reed is also valued for its use in basket-making and as a natural windbreak."
