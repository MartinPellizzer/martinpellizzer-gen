    "intro": "Aconitum kirinense var. australe, commonly known as the Japanese monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple spurred flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, palmate shape. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.",
