    "intro": "Alchemilla hirsuticaulis, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, cylindrical stems and heart-shaped, serrated leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. Alchemilla hirsuticaulis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
