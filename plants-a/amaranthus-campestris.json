    "intro": "Amaranthus campestris, commonly known as tumbleweed, is an annual plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces dry, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its ability to spread over large areas. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and can be edible when young. Amaranthus campestris is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
