    "intro": "Archidendron, commonly known as the climbing tamarind, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are characterized by their woody stems and compound leaves, often with small, paired leaflets. They produce distinctive pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds and are used in traditional medicine. Archidendron species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Their ability to climb and their nitrogen-fixing properties make them ecologically and agriculturally significant."
