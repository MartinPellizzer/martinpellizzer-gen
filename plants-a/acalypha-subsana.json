    "intro": "Acalypha subsana, commonly known as the red-veined nettle, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive red veins on its leaves. The plant has small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha subsana is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant thrives in lowland areas and is frequently associated with forest understories. It is also present in parts of the Philippines and Malaysia. Its distribution is largely limited to these regions, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha subsana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was likely brought there during the 19th or early 20th century by horticulturists and gardeners seeking exotic plants for landscaping. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant spreads primarily through seed dispersal by wind, water, and human activity. Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native species in island environments."
