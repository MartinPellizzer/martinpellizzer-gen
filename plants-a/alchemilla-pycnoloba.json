    "intro": "Alchemilla pycnoloba, commonly known as the dense-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along streambanks. Alchemilla pycnoloba is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and its ability to attract pollinators."
