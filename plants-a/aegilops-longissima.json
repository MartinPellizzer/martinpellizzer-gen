    "intro": "Aegilops longissima, commonly known as the long\u7a57 goatgrass, is a wild wheat relative native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its long, slender spikes and grass-like leaves, which are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in arid conditions. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in some areas. Due to its genetic similarity to wheat, it is of interest in agricultural research for potential crop improvement."
