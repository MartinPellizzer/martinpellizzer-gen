    "intro": "Arctium minus var. corymbosum, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of purple to pink flowers, which are followed by spiny, bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in fields, along roadsides, and in waste areas. The plant has been used historically for its medicinal properties, particularly for its purported skin-soothing effects."
