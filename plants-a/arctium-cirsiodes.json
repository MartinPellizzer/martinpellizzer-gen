    "intro": "Arctium cirsiodes, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and leafy structures. The plant features rough, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. Its most distinctive feature is the spiny, bur-like fruit that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. Arctium cirsiodes typically grows in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows."
