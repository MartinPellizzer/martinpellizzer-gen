It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates with cold winters and warm, dry summers. The plant features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which are often hairy on the underside. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging environmental conditions.",
