    "intro": "Asperula stricta subsp. latibracteata, commonly known as the broad-bract asperula, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It features small, dark green leaves that are densely arranged along the stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, oval berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its ornamental value lies in its foliage and delicate floral display."
