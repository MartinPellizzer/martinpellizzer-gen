    "intro": "Asplenium morobense, commonly known as the Morobe spleenwort, is a fern native to the Pacific Islands, particularly New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that typically grow in dense clusters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or on tree trunks in tropical rainforests. Its spores are dispersed through wind, and it plays a role in the ecological structure of its habitat. Asplenium morobense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage."
