    "intro": "Arenaria perlevis, commonly known as the silver sandplant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine, silvery or grayish coating, which helps reduce water loss. Arenaria perlevis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy or rocky habitats."
