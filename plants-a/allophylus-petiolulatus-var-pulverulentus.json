    "intro": "Allophylus petiolulatus var. pulverulentus, commonly known as the powdered hibiscus, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom during the wet season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The powdery texture of its leaves is a distinguishing feature that aids in its identification."
