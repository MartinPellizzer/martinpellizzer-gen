    "intro": "Aethionema dumanii, commonly known as the Armenian rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a silvery-blue hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Aethionema dumanii thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
