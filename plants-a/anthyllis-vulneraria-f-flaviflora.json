It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of North Africa, often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, and it has a deep root system that helps it thrive in poor soil conditions. The species is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
