    "intro": "Agrostis aenea, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Agrostis aenea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
