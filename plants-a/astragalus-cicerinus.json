    "intro": "Astragalus cicerinus, commonly known as the Greek milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus cicerinus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
