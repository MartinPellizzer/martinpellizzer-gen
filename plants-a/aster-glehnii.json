    "intro": "Aster glehnii, commonly known as the Glehn's aster, is a herbaceous perennial native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its showy, daisy-like flowers bloom in late summer, producing blue to purple petals surrounding a yellow center. Aster glehnii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
