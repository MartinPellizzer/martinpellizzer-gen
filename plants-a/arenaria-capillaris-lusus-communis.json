    "intro": "Arenaria capillaris lusus communis, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has compact, mat-forming growth habit with tiny, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to cold climates and nutrient-poor substrates."
