    "intro": "Astragalus trigonus, commonly known as the three-lobed milkvetch, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in prairie and steppe habitats. Its seeds are enclosed in a hairy pod and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize open areas. Astragalus trigonus is also noted for its potential medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices."
