    "intro": "Avena argentea, commonly known as silver oat, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are usually greenish or pale yellow, and it produces small, three-angled achenes as seeds. Silver oat is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
