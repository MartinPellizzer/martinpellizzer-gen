    "intro": "Arceuthobium juniperi, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to juniper trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by birds. Its life cycle involves a complex interaction with both the host tree and the dispersing agents. Botanically, it is notable for its unique method of seed dispersal, where the seeds are ejected forcefully from the fruit."
