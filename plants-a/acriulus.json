    "intro": "Acriulus, commonly known as the marsh helleborine, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are typically found in wet or marshy habitats across Europe, Asia, and Africa. They are characterized by their erect, leafy stems and showy, greenish-yellow to brownish flowers that bloom in late summer. Acriulus species are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks rather than in soil. Their botanical significance lies in their ecological role and their use in traditional medicine."
