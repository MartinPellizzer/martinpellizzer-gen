    "intro": "Aspidium subsageniaceum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a finely divided structure. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. Aspidium subsageniaceum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
