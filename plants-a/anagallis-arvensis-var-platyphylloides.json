    "intro": "Anagallis arvensis var. platyphylloides, commonly known as the broad-leafed mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple. The leaves are broad and oval, often with a slightly wavy margin, and the plant grows in moist, disturbed soils. It is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in other open habitats. This variant is distinguished by its broader foliage compared to the typical form of Anagallis arvensis."
