The plant is native to tropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with high humidity and warm climates. Its reproductive structures include sori, which are clusters of sporangia found on the underside of the fronds. This fern is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments.",
