    "intro": "Astragalus gossypinus var. phyllostachys, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and compound leaves with small, bean-like pods. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed sites. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
