It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across rocky substrates. Aspidium pachinense plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
