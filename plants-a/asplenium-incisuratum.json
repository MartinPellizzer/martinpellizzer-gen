    "intro": "Asplenium incisuratum, commonly known as the serrated spleenwort, is a small evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often finely toothed or serrated along the edges. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rock crevices or forest floors, and is often epiphytic or lithophytic. Its fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. Asplenium incisuratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, fern-like appearance."
