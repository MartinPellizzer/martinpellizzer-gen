    "intro": "Aristida divergens, commonly known as the divergent grass or slender threeawn, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers arranged in panicles. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
