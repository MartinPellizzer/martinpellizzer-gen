It features glossy, dark green oval leaves that are typically arranged in whorls along the stems. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The berries are edible for humans but can be toxic to some animals."
