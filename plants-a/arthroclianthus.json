    "intro": "Arthroclianthus, commonly known as the sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. The plants typically have small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, and their leaves are often finely divided. Arthroclianthus species are adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions. They are of interest in botanical studies due to their unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
