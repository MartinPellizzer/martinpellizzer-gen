    "intro": "Allochrusa, commonly known as the sand lily, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Alstroemeriaceae. These plants are native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina, where they thrive in arid and coastal environments. Allochrusa species are characterized by their narrow, grass-like leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. They are often found growing in sandy or rocky soils, and some species are cultivated for their ornamental value. Due to their specific habitat requirements, many Allochrusa species are considered rare or endangered."
