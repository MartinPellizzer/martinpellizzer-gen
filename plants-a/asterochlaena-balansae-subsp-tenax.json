It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typical of the daisy family. It is native to specific regions in South America and thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
