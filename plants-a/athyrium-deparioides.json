    "intro": "Athyrium deparioides, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into small, triangular segments. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both roots and new shoots, allowing it to spread gradually. The spores are borne on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates."
