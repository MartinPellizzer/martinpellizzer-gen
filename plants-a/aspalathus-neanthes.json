    "intro": "Aspalathus neanthes, commonly known as the small-leaved rooibos, is a shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and requires a warm, Mediterranean climate. It is closely related to the more well-known rooibos (Aspalathus linearis). Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is less commercially cultivated than its relative."
