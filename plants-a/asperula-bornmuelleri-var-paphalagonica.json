    "intro": "Asperula bornmuelleri var. paphalagonica, commonly known as the Paphlagonian azalea, is a flowering shrub native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing fragrant, pinkish-white to pale purple blossoms. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
