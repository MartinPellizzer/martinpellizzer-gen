    "intro": "Aconitum trichocarpum, commonly known as the hairy fruit monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and southern Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant features a tall, unbranched stem with alternating leaves that are palmately lobed. Its flowers are typically arranged in a single cluster at the top of the stem, and it produces small, hairy fruits that mature in late summer. Aconitum trichocarpum is known for its ornamental value in gardens but contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous to handle.",
