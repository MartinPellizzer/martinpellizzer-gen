    "intro": "Angelica pratensis, commonly known as field angelica, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It grows up to 2 meters tall, with large, umbrella-shaped compound leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a tall, branched stem with numerous small flowers arranged in a compound umbel. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and wetlands. The roots and seeds of Angelica pratensis have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
