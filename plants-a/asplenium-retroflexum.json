It is characterized by its compact, clump-forming growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often curled or twisted. The fronds are typically divided into narrow, linear segments with a distinctive, almost shield-like appearance. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
