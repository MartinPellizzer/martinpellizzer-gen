    "intro": "Aloe maculata subsp. maculata, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, pointed leaves with distinctive dark green bands and white or yellow spots. The leaves are typically upright and have a waxy texture, which helps the plant store water. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. This species is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements."
