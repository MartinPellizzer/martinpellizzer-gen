It is characterized by its narrower, more elongated leaves compared to the typical form. This plant is native to specific regions in Europe, particularly in mountainous areas. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a distinct, aromatic scent that attracts pollinators."
