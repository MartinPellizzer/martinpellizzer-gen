    "intro": "Abrus melanospermus subsp. tenuiflorus, commonly known as the slender-flowered poison bean, is a member of the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, elongated pods that contain toxic seeds. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in disturbed or open habitats. Its flowers are small and usually white or pale in color, arranged in racemes. Due to the presence of abrin, a potent toxin, it is considered highly poisonous and requires caution during handling.",
