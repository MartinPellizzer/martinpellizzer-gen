It features aromatic, gray-green leaves that are finely divided and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in dry, sunny conditions and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Its strong scent and medicinal properties have made it historically valuable in traditional herbal remedies."
