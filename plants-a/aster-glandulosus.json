It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant features hairy, glandular leaves that give it its scientific name, and it produces showy blue to purple flowers in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Aster glandulosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for pollinators."
