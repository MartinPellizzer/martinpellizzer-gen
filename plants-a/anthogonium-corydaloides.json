It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and clusters of small, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant produces elongated, spiral-shaped fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
