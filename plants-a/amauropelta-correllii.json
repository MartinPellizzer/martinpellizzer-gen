    "intro": "Amauropelta correllii, commonly known as the Appalachian shield fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
