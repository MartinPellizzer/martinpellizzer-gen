    "intro": "Aulomyrcia klotzschiana var. depauperata, commonly known as the poorleaf aulomyrcia, is a rare shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically glaucous and have a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
