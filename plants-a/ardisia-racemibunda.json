    "intro": "Ardisia racemibunda, commonly known as the clustered beautyberry, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that appear in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are visually striking. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a glossy surface. The berries are edible for birds but are generally not consumed by humans due to their bitter taste."
