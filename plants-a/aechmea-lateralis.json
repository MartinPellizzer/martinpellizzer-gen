    "intro": "Aechmea lateralis, commonly known as the silver pine bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaf structure, which forms a central cup to collect water and nutrients. The leaves are typically long, narrow, and covered in a silvery-gray coating, giving it its common name. It produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. This plant is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental species in gardens and greenhouses."
