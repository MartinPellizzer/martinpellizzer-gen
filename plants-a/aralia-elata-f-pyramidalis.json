    "intro": "Aralia elata f. pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal angel's trumpets, is a compact, upright shrub native to the eastern United States. It features finely divided, feather-like leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Its unique form and ornamental value make it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
