    "intro": "Aechmea viridis, commonly known as the green bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The leaves are typically broad, stiff, and covered in a waxy layer that helps reduce water loss. It produces striking inflorescences with vibrant, long-lasting flowers that range from yellow to red. This plant is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of indoor environments."
