    "intro": "Agrimonia serrifolia, commonly known as common agrimony, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has serrated, lance-shaped leaves and produces woody, branched stems that can become quite tall. Agrimony is often found in dry grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. It is valued in traditional herbal medicine for its purported digestive and tonic properties."
