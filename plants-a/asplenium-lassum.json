    "intro": "Asplenium lassum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to parts of Asia and Africa. It typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, often on cliffs or in forest understories. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with finely divided, lance-shaped fronds. Its spores are produced on the underside of its leaves, which are covered in tiny, hair-like structures called rhizoids. Asplenium lassum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in challenging growing conditions."
