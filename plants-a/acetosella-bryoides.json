    "intro": "Acetosella bryoides, commonly known as the mossy sorrel, is a low-growing plant belonging to the Primulaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, dark green leaves that often resemble moss. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-white flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, hairy stalks. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Acetosella bryoides is notable for its ability to tolerate acidic soils and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats.",
