It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces distinctive, elongated seed capsules that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in harsh environmental conditions. Alsine macrocarpa plays a role in stabilizing dunes and is often found in coastal and desert ecosystems."
