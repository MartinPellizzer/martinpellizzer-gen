These plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that often resemble those of the true lily of the valley. Agrostomia species are typically found in temperate regions and thrive in moist, well-drained soils. They produce small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. The genus includes several species, such as Agrostomia ciliata and Agrostomia rupicola, which are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
