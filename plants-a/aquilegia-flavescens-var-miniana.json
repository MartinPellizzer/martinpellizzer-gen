    "intro": "Aquilegia flavescens var. miniana, commonly known as the yellow columbine, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking, spurred petals that range in color from yellow to orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade conditions. Its leaves are palmately compound, with finely divided lobes, and it produces seed pods that split open to release seeds with tufts of hair for wind dispersal. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and naturalized areas."
