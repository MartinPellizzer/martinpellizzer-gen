    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia decora is primarily native to New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria. It is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas within these regions. This species thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils. It is often seen in open woodlands and heathlands. Acacia decora plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia decora was mainly introduced to India as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various environmental conditions. It has been widely cultivated in gardens and landscapes across the country because of its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil. The plant is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of timber. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts in native habitats. Despite these concerns, Acacia decora remains a popular choice for horticultural purposes in India."
