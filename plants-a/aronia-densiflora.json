    "intro": "Aronia densiflora, commonly known as the black chokeberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of small, red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces edible berries that transition from red to black as they mature, typically in the fall. These berries are rich in antioxidants and have been used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. Aronia densiflora thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks."
