It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hairy texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or limestone habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in tropical regions."
