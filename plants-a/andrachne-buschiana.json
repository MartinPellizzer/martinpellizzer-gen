    "intro": "Andrachne buschiana, commonly known as the Busch's sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and hairy, gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its succulent leaves and stems allow it to store water, making it well adapted to arid environments. Andrachne buschiana is often found in sandy or rocky soils, thriving in full sun conditions."
