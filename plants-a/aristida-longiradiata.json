    "intro": "Aristida longiradiata, commonly known as the long-bracted threeawn, is a grass species native to Africa and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical spikelets and long, bristly awns that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its inflorescence consists of multiple spikelets arranged in a panicle, with the upper bracts being longer than the lower ones. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
