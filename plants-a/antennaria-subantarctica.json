    "intro": "Antennaria subantarctica, commonly known as the Antarctic pearlwort, is a low-growing plant native to the extreme environments of Antarctica and the subantarctic regions. It is a member of the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is characterized by its tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the brief summer season. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with dense, hairy leaves that help insulate it against the harsh cold. Its adaptations include a short growing season and the ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils, making it a resilient species in one of the most extreme habitats on Earth."
