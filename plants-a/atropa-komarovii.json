    "intro": "Atropa komarovii, commonly known as the Komarov's belladonna, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range from white to violet in color. The plant produces toxic berries that contain tropane alkaloids, similar to other members of the Atropa genus. Its leaves are typically large, lobed, and have a distinctive waxy texture. Due to its toxicity, it is often found in remote, less disturbed habitats where it can thrive without human interference."
