    "intro": "Amerimnon cambodianum, commonly known as the Cambodian starflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and riverbanks. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a smooth, glossy surface. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
