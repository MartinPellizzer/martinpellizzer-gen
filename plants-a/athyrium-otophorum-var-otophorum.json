    "intro": "Athyrium otophorum var. otophorum, commonly known as the Otophorum Athyrium, is a fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features delicate, arching fronds with a dark green coloration and a finely textured appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming compact clumps. The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of the Athyrium genus."
