    "intro": "Andrachne ephemera, commonly known as the ephemeral sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, often before the leaves fully develop. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Andrachne ephemera is adapted to sandy or rocky soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
