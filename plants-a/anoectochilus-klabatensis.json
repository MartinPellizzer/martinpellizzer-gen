    "intro": "Anoectochilus klabatensis, commonly known as the Klabat orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Indonesia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are often covered in a dense, spongy layer of mycorrhizal fungi, which aids in nutrient absorption. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
