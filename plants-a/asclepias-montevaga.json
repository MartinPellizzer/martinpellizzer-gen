    "intro": "Asclepias montevaga, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of vibrant orange to yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces follicles that contain toxic, milky sap, which is a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are opposite, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Asclepias montevaga is an important host plant for monarch butterfly larvae, playing a crucial role in local ecosystems."
