    "intro": "Agathis robusta, commonly known as the giant's pine or woolly mahogany, is a large evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araucariaceae and is characterized by its tall stature, often reaching heights of over 50 meters. The tree has a straight trunk with a thick, flaky bark that provides some resistance to pests and diseases. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in humid environments. The plant is also notable for its large, cone-like fruits that contain seeds enclosed in woody capsules."
