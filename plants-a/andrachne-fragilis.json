    "intro": "Andrachne fragilis, commonly known as the brittle sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and sandy environments. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant has tiny, translucent leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky slopes. Due to its fragility, it is sensitive to disturbances and requires careful conservation efforts."
