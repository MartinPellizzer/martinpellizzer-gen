    "intro": "Aspidistra opaca, commonly known as the Japanese evergreen, is a perennial plant native to Japan and Korea. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its dark green, leathery, strap-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are surrounded by a spathe, typical of the Araceae family. It is well adapted to low-light conditions and is often cultivated as an indoor plant due to its tolerance of shade and poor soil conditions. Aspidistra opaca is also valued for its ability to thrive in humid environments and its ability to purify indoor air."
