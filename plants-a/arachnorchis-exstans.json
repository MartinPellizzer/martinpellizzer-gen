    "intro": "Arachnorchis exstans, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with long, thin, hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as rainforests and understoreys. It produces a single, erect spike bearing several flowers, which are often fragrant. Arachnorchis exstans is a protected species due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes."
