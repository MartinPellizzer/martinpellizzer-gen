    "intro": "Aspidium membranifolium var. dimorphum, commonly known as the two-form membranifolium, is a variant of the common water fern. It is a perennial fern characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi-lobed. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variant is notable for its morphological variation, which includes differences in frond shape and size compared to the typical form."
