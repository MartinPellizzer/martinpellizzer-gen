    "intro": "Ascalea, commonly known as the golden groundsel, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to southern Africa. The plants are typically low-growing shrubs or herbs with distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. They have rough, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Ascalea species are often used in gardens for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry conditions."
