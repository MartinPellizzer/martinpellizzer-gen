    "intro": "Acacia leptocarpa, commonly known as the slender wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family Fabaceae and is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads, which are typical of the Acacia genus. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy soils. Acacia leptocarpa is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia leptocarpa is primarily native to the Lesser Sunda Is., New Guinea, Northern Territory, Queensland, and Western Australia. This species is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including coastal areas, sandy soils, and open woodlands. The plant is well adapted to the warm and often arid climates of its native range. Its distribution reflects its preference for well-drained soils and full sun exposure.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia leptocarpa was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the southern and western parts of the country. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its extensive root system and ability to stabilize soil. It also serves as a valuable source of forage for livestock in certain regions. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in non-native environments."
