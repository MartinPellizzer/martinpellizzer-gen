    "intro": "Ageratum serratum, commonly known as the serrated ageratum, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant features finely serrated leaves that are often covered in a soft, fuzzy texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden borders and containers. Ageratum serratum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
