    "intro": "Agarista pyrifolia, commonly known as the flameleaf agarista, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in forested areas. The plant is characterized by its striking, lobed leaves that are often red or orange in color, which give it its common name. Its small, clustered flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, round berries that are edible. Agarista pyrifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant foliage."
