    "intro": "Arabis alpina subsp. cantabrica, commonly known as the Cantabrian rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of northern Spain and southern France. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features basal leaves that are spoon-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers in early spring, which are arranged in racemes. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
