    "intro": "Agropyron trachycaulum var. ciliatum, commonly known as the rough wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with leaves that are typically blue-green in color and have a rough, scaly texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. This grass is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
