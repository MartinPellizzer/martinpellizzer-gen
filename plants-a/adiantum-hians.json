    "intro": "Adiantum hians, commonly known as the running maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to Southeast Asia. It features finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often described as resembling the tail of a running woman, hence its common name. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining soil. Adiantum hians is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.",
