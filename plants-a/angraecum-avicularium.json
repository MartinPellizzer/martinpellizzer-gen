    "intro": "Angraecum avicularium, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Madagascar. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns that attract specific pollinators. Its flowers are often nocturnal, opening at night to attract moths. Angraecum avicularium is known for its resilience and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
