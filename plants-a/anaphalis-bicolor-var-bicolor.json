    "intro": "Anaphalis bicolor var. bicolor, commonly known as the silverleaf frostflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is characterized by its silvery-white, woolly foliage and clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance. The plant's unique appearance and cold tolerance make it a distinctive addition to alpine gardens."
