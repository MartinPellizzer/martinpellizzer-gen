    "intro": "Agauria littoralis, commonly known as the coastal agauria, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils near the shoreline. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Agauria littoralis is adapted to salt spray and can withstand periodic flooding, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems."
