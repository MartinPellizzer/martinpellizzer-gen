    "intro": "Allium parnassicum, commonly known as the alpine garlic or mountain garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces bulbs that are often used in traditional medicine and cuisine, similar to other Allium species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Allium parnassicum is also valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens and alpine settings."
