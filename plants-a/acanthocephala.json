    "intro": "Acanthocephala, commonly known as the spiny-headed worms, are parasitic organisms belonging to the phylum Acanthocephala. These animals are characterized by their complex life cycles, typically involving intermediate hosts such as crustaceans and definitive hosts like fish or mammals. They possess a unique anatomy, including a proboscis armed with hooks used to attach to the intestinal walls of their hosts. Acanthocephalans lack a digestive system and absorb nutrients directly through their body walls. Their presence in aquatic ecosystems can have significant ecological impacts, influencing host behavior and population dynamics."
