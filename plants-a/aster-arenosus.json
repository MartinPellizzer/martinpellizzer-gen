    "intro": "Aster arenosus, commonly known as the sand aster, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is well adapted to sandy soils. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, blooming in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Aster arenosus plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing sandy soils."
