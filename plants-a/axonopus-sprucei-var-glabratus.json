    "intro": "Axonopus sprucei var. glabratus, commonly known as the smooth axonopus, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Southeast Asia. It features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth and hairless. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are arranged in dense spikelets, characteristic of the grass family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its dense growth habit, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control and ground cover."
