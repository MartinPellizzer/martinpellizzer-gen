    "intro": "Alnus \u00d7 hybrida var. intermedia, commonly known as the hybrid alder, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is a hybrid between Alnus incana and Alnus serrulata, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The tree has smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse via wind. This species is often found in moist soils along streambanks and is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
