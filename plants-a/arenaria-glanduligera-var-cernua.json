    "intro": "Arenaria glanduligera var. cernua, commonly known as the prostrate sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky habitats. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. Its prostrate growth habit allows it to spread across the ground, forming dense mats. It is often found in coastal dunes, sandy soils, and other dry, well-drained areas."
