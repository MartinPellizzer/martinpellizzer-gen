    "intro": "Arenaria stricta var. texana, commonly known as Texas sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are linear and succulent, helping to conserve water in dry conditions. It is often found in open habitats such as plains, rocky outcrops, and disturbed areas."
