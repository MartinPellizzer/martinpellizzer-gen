It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are smooth to the touch. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often loosely arranged, giving it a delicate appearance. Anthoxanthum glabrum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
