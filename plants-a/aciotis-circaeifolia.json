    "intro": "Aciotis circaeifolia, commonly known as the woolly goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well adapted to harsh, sun-exposed conditions. Aciotis circaeifolia is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.",
