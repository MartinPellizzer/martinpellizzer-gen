    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacallis hoehnei is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa. It is found in the coastal regions of the country, particularly in the Eastern and Western Cape provinces. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is commonly found in coastal dunes and fynbos vegetation. It is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. Acacallis hoehnei is a small, flowering plant that plays a role in the local ecosystem and is of interest to botanists and conservationists.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacallis hoehnei was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, particularly in regions of South America. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open grasslands. This plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas quickly. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems. Due to its adaptability, it has been reported in several countries across the continent."
