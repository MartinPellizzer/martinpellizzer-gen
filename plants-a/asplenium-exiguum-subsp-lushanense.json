    "intro": "Asplenium exiguum subsp. lushanense, commonly known as the Lushan shield fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, dense rosette of lanceolate, dark green leaves. The fronds are typically short and upright, with a leathery texture and a distinctive, shield-like appearance. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
