    "intro": "Alternanthera ramosissima var. missionum, commonly known as the Red Alternanthera, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage, which becomes more intense under bright light conditions. The plant has slender, branching stems that often trail or float in water, making it a popular choice for water gardens and aquariums. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth texture and a glossy appearance. It prefers moderate to high light and can thrive in a variety of water conditions, though it benefits from regular pruning to maintain its shape and encourage dense growth."
