    "intro": "Aspalathus alternifolia, commonly known as rooibos, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its feathery, alternate leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a warm, dry climate. Rooibos is renowned for its unique flavor and is widely used to produce a popular herbal tea. Its botanical significance lies in its ability to grow in arid conditions and its role in traditional South African medicine."
