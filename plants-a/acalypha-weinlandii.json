Acalypha weinlandii is also valued for its ability to attract birds and butterflies to the garden.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha weinlandii is primarily native to the Caribbean, specifically the Greater Antilles, including Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico. It is also found in parts of Central America, such as Belize and southern Mexico. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within tropical forests. It is often seen in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. Its natural range is limited to these specific regions, where it thrives in the warm, humid climate.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha weinlandii was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its striking foliage and unique appearance. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions as a decorative plant. The species is often found in gardens, public spaces, and as part of landscape design. Its introduction has led to its establishment in some non-native areas, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. Despite its aesthetic value, careful management is recommended to prevent unintended spread."
