    "intro": "Alliaria taurica, commonly known as the Tauric garlic, is a perennial herb native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It is characterized by its strong garlic-like odor, which comes from sulfur compounds in its foliage. Alliaria taurica is often found in rocky or mountainous areas and is valued for its medicinal properties."
