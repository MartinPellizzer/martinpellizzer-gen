It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces distinctive, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Astragalus muschketowii is often used in traditional medicine and is of interest to botanists for its ecological and phytochemical properties."
