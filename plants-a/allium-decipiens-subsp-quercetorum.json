It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in late summer. The plant is notable for its aromatic, bulbous structure, which is used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
