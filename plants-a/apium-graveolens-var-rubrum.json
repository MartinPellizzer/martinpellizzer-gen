    "intro": "Apium graveolens var. rubrum, commonly known as red celery, is a cultivated variety of the celery plant characterized by its reddish-purple stalks. It belongs to the Apiaceae family and is native to Europe and western Asia. The plant features finely divided, feathery leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in umbels. Its flavor is slightly more pungent than regular celery, and it is often used in culinary applications. The reddish coloration of its stems is due to the presence of anthocyanins, which also contribute to its nutritional value."
