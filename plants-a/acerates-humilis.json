    "intro": "Acerates humilis, commonly known as the low acerates, is a small, herbaceous plant native to certain regions of South America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are often heart-shaped or ovate in form. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-white in color, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Acerates humilis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.",
