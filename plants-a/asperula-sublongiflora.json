    "intro": "Asperula sublongiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered woodruff, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its fragrant, small white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has slender, trailing stems that often form dense mats. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture, while its flowers bloom in clusters during the spring. Asperula sublongiflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
