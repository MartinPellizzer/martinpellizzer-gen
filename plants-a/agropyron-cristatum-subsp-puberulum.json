    "intro": "Agropyron cristatum subsp. puberulum, commonly known as the hairy crested wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold and arid regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive crested inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant has hairy leaves and stems, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It is well adapted to poor soils and is often used in reclamation projects due to its hardiness. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
