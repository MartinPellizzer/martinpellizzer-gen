    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer chiangdaoense is primarily native to Thailand. This species is found in the northern regions of the country, particularly in the Chiang Dao area. It thrives in humid, subtropical climates with well-drained soils. The plant is commonly associated with montane forests and is often found at elevations between 1,000 and 2,000 meters. Its natural distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within Thailand's mountainous terrain.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer chiangdaoense was mainly introduced to the temperate regions of East Asia, particularly in China, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is commonly found in mountainous areas with cool climates, often growing in forests or along stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental value due to its vibrant autumn foliage and unique leaf shape. It has also been introduced to other parts of the world, including North America and Europe, for horticultural purposes. However, its natural range remains primarily restricted to its native habitat in southern China."
