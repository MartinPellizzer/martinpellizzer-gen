    "intro": "Astragalus consanguineus, commonly known as the close-relative milkvetch, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow or orange flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Astragalus consanguineus is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
