    "intro": "Alopecurus \u00d7 hybridus, commonly known as hybrid meadowgrass, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Alopecurus pratensis (tall fescue) and Alopecurus aequalis (smooth meadowgrass). It is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in meadows, pastures, and along streambanks. Due to its hybrid nature, it does not produce viable seeds, relying instead on vegetative propagation for spread."
