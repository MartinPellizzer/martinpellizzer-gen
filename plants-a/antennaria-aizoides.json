    "intro": "Antennaria aizoides, commonly known as the hairy willow or mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, and its leaves are covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Its flowers are insect-pollinated, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed or nutrient-poor environments. Antennaria aizoides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
