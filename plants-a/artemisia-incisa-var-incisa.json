    "intro": "Artemisia incisa var. incisa, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage composed of narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its strong scent and medicinal properties, it has been historically used in herbal remedies and as a natural pest repellent."
