    "intro": "Aechmea hyacinthus, commonly known as the pink pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for hydration. The plant produces a tall flower spike bearing colorful, showy bracts that resemble flowers, often in shades of pink, red, or orange. Its foliage is typically broad and waxy, with a bluish-green hue and prominent veins. Aechmea hyacinthus thrives in humid, bright environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
