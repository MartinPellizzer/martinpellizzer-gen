    "intro": "Aristida adscensionis var. condensata, commonly known as the dense hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and dense, fine-textured foliage. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of native plant communities and a candidate for ecological restoration projects."
