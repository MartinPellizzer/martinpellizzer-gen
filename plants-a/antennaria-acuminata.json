    "intro": "Antennaria acuminata, commonly known as the slender mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy foliage. The plant features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. Its flowers are typically pale pink or white, arranged in clusters and blooming in late summer. Antennaria acuminata thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions."
