    "intro": "Aconitum kusnezoffii var. gibbiferum, commonly known as the Kusnezoff's aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple spires of flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features palmately compound leaves with a rough, hairy texture, and its roots are tuberous, typical of the genus Aconitum. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care.",
