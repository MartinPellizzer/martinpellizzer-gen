    "intro": "Asplenium mexicanum, commonly known as the Mexican spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rock crevices. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a layer of fine, hair-like structures. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium mexicanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
