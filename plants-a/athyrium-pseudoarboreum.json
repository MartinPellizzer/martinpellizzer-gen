    "intro": "Athyrium pseudoarboreum, commonly known as the tree fern athyrium, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a slender, upright trunk that resembles a small tree, covered with a layer of dead fronds. Its fronds are bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance, and they emerge from the base of the trunk. The plant's unique morphology makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and botanical collections."
