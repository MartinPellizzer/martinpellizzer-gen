It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often blue or purple in color. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Due to its ecological significance, it is often found in restoration projects aimed at wetland conservation."
