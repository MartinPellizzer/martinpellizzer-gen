    "intro": "Anemia elaphoglossoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a small, aquatic fern native to eastern North America. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that are often submerged or floating on the water surface. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Anemia elaphoglossoides plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
