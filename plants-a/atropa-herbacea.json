    "intro": "Atropa herbacea, commonly known as the deadly nightshade, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its spiny stems and dark, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically purple or violet in color. Its berries are bright red and highly toxic, containing tropane alkaloids such as atropine and scopolamine. Despite its toxicity, it has been historically used in medicine and as a source of poisons."
