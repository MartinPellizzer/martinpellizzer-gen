    "intro": "Alphitonia pomaderroides, commonly known as the broad-leaved sandpaper tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, leathery, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, sandpaper-like texture. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
