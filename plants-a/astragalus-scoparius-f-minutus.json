    "intro": "Astragalus scoparius f. minutus, commonly known as the dwarf milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of yellow to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its small stature and compact growth habit make it well-suited for xerophytic environments. It is often found in sagebrush steppe and other dry, open habitats."
