    "intro": "Anacampseros divaricata, commonly known as the desert stone cactus, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, globular stem with a smooth, pale green surface that stores water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the rainy season, which are clustered at the top of the stem. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and protecting it from herbivores. Anacampseros divaricata thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for arid gardens."
