    "intro": "Alchemilla stenoleuca, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in a cup-like structure known as an involucre. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. Alchemilla stenoleuca is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in moist, shady conditions."
