    "intro": "Alnus incana var. lobata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks. This species is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria."
