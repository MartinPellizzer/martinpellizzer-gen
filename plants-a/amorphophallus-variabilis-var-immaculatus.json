    "intro": "Amorphophallus variabilis var. immaculatus, commonly known as the white-veined elephant's foot, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, tuberous stem that resembles an elephant's foot, which stores water and nutrients. The plant produces large, showy flowers with a distinctive purple and white coloration, often emitting a strong odor similar to rotting meat. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variant is prized for its ornamental value and unique morphology."
