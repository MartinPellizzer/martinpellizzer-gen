    "intro": "Arabidopsis arenosa var. runcinata, commonly known as the coastal Arabidopsis, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, white flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. It is often used in botanical studies due to its genetic simplicity and ecological resilience. Its variability in morphology makes it an important species for research on plant adaptation and evolution."
