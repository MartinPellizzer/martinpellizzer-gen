    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies araragi is primarily native to the Japanese archipelago, specifically Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu. This species thrives in cool, moist environments at higher elevations, often found in mountainous regions. It is commonly associated with coniferous forests and is adapted to the temperate climate of Japan. The plant is also known as the Japanese white fir and is a significant component of the region's flora. Its distribution is limited to these specific areas due to its particular ecological requirements.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies araragi was mainly introduced to Japan, where it is cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections. It is also found in parts of South Korea and has been introduced to some regions in North America. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities, including its pyramidal shape and fragrant needles. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often planted in shaded areas. Due to its limited natural range, it is not commonly found in the wild outside its native habitat."
