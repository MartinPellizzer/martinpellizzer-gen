It is characterized by its golden-yellow coloration in the fall and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. The plant has narrow, upright leaves and produces panicles of small, beige to yellow flowers. It is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil. Its botanical features make it an important component of native grassland ecosystems."
