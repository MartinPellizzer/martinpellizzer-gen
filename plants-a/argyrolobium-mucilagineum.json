    "intro": "Argyrolobium mucilagineum, commonly known as the sticky false flax, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a sprawling growth habit with slender, hairy stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a sticky, mucilaginous substance that gives the plant its common name. The species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils."
