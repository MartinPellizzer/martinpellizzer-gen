    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha goudotiana is primarily native to Madagascar. It is found in the eastern part of the island, particularly in the humid lowland and montane rainforests. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of tropical forests. It is not commonly found outside of its native range. The species is part of the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its ornamental value.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha goudotiana was mainly introduced to urban and disturbed areas, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is commonly found along roadsides, in vacant lots, and near waterways. The plant spreads through both seeds and vegetative reproduction, making it a persistent weed in these environments. Its rapid growth and adaptability contribute to its success in colonizing new areas. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
