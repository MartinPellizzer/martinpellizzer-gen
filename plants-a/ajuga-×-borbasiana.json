    "intro": "Ajuga \u00d7 borbasiana, commonly known as carpet bugle or silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and features small, attractive flowers that range from blue to purple in color. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically silver-gray in appearance, giving it a distinctive visual appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in rock gardens or as ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Ajuga \u00d7 borbasiana is also known for its ability to spread readily through rhizomes, making it both a desirable and sometimes invasive plant in certain environments."
