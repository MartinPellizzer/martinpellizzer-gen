    "intro": "Aspidium pallidum, commonly known as the pale moonwort, is a fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in small, clusters on the underside of its fronds. Aspidium pallidum is a relatively small fern, usually reaching heights of only a few centimeters."
