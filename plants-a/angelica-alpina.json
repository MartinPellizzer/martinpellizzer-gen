It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in an umbel, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are large, pinnately compound, and have a distinctive aromatic scent. Angelica alpina is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
