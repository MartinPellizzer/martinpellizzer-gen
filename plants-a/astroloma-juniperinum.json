    "intro": "Astroloma juniperinum, commonly known as the Juniper Bush. It is a flowering plant native to southern Australia, characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and needle-like, giving it a resemblance to juniper, hence its common name. Astroloma juniperinum is often found in heathlands and coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soils."
