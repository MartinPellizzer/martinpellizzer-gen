    "intro": "Astrebla lappacea, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Astrebla lappacea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
