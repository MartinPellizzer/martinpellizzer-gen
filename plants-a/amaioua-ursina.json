    "intro": "Amaioua ursina, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and elongated, elliptical leaves that are often glossy in appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by woody, spindle-shaped fruits containing several seeds. Amaioua ursina is valued for its hard, dense wood, which has been historically used in furniture and carving. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species in its native range."
