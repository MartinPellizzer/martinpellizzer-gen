    "intro": "Alchemilla colorata subsp. exigua, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in clusters atop slender stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
