    "intro": "Asclepias curassavica f. kentingensis, commonly known as the Kenting milkweed, is a variant of the common milkweed native to southern China. It is characterized by its striking red and orange flowers, which are highly attractive to pollinators such as butterflies and bees. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release silky-haired seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for gardens in warmer climates. Its botanical features make it an important plant for both ecological and ornamental purposes."
