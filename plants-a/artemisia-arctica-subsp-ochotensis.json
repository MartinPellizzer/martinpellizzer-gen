It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. It is often found in tundra and alpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms. Its chemical composition includes volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its medicinal and aromatic properties."
