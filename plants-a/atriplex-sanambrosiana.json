    "intro": "Atriplex sanambrosiana, commonly known as the desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, salt-tolerant leaves that help it survive in harsh, saline environments. The plant produces small greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers. Atriplex sanambrosiana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
