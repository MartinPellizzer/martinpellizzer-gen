    "intro": "Astragalus gobi-altaicus, commonly known as the Gobi milkvetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods containing lens-shaped seeds, which are adapted for dispersal in harsh desert environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in steppes and semi-desert areas. Astragalus gobi-altaicus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
