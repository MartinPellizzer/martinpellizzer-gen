    "intro": "Arachniodes palmipes, commonly known as the spider fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble spider webs. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a finely divided structure that enhances its ornamental appeal. Arachniodes palmipes thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in tropical gardens."
