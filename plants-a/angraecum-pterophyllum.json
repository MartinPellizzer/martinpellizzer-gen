It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy flowers that typically bloom at night. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink with a distinct, elongated spur. Angraecum pterophyllum is well adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat."
