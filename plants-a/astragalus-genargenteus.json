    "intro": "Astragalus genargenteus, commonly known as silverleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Astragalus genargenteus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
