    "intro": "Astragalus brevidens, commonly known as the short-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant has compound leaves with numerous leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Astragalus brevidens plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment."
