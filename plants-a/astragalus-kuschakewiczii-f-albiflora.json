    "intro": "Astragalus kuschakewiczii f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered milkvetch, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typical of the Astragalus genus. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
