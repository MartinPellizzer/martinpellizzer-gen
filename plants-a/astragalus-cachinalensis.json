It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and can be found in areas with low precipitation. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sensitive species in its native range."
