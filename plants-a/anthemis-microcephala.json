It features small, daisy-like yellow flowers with white ray florets, and its leaves are aromatic and covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its essential oils, derived from the flowers, have been used in traditional medicine for their calming and anti-inflammatory properties. The species is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract beneficial insects."
