    "intro": "Alisma tangerina, commonly known as the Chinese water plantain, is a semi-aquatic herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. The plant has slender, ribbon-like leaves that are usually submerged or floating, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in late summer. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported health benefits. Alisma tangerina is valued for its ability to thrive in wet environments and its historical significance in herbal practices."
