    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 heuflerio, commonly known as the hybrid shield fern, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum. It is characterized by its compact, dense foliage and shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or woodland areas. Asplenium \u00d7 heuflerio is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions."
