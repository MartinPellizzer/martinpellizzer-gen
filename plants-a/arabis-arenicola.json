    "intro": "Arabis arenicola, commonly known as the sand arabis, is a low-growing flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically features succulent, gray-green leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with dry, sunny conditions."
