    "intro": "Astragalus stevenianus subsp. meskheticus, commonly known as the Steven's milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. It is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria, contributing to soil fertility. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological role and limited distribution."
