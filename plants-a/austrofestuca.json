These plants are characterized by their fine, tufted foliage and often form dense, low-growing clumps. They typically thrive in well-drained soils and are adapted to cooler climates. Austrofestuca species are often used in landscaping for their ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil. Their botanical features include narrow leaves and inflorescences that are usually spike-like or panicle-shaped."
