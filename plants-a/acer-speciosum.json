It is characterized by its ornamental foliage, which turns vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree has smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have finely serrated margins. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras. This species is often found in rocky soils and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.",
