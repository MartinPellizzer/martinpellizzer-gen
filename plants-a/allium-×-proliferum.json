    "intro": "Allium \u00d7 proliferum, commonly known as the tree leek, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers at the top of the stem, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broad, flat, and resemble those of garlic or onions, though they are more robust. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has a mild, garlic-like scent when crushed."
