    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa var. japonica, commonly known as Japanese alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan and parts of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits called samaras. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks. This species is valued for its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
