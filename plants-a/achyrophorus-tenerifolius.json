    "intro": "Achyrophorus tenerifolius, commonly known as the Canary Island pine, is a unique evergreen conifer native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its slender, upward-curving needles and its ability to thrive in rocky, arid environments. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a long-lived species. Its cones are woody and contain edible seeds, which have been historically used by local populations. The tree plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for endemic wildlife.",
