    "intro": "Acacia buxifolia, commonly known as the boxleaf acacia, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense, dark green foliage with leaves that are small, ovate, and have a leathery texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Acacia buxifolia is also valued for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia buxifolia is primarily native to New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria. This shrub or small tree is commonly found in dry to semi-arid regions within these states. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often seen in open woodlands and grasslands. The plant is well adapted to the local climate and can tolerate periods of drought. Its distribution reflects its preference for the specific environmental conditions found in these areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia buxifolia was mainly introduced to India. It is commonly found in the states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Karnataka. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in landscaping. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil. However, it has also been reported to spread beyond cultivated areas, raising concerns about its invasive potential."
