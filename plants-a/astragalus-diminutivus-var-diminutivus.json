    "intro": "Astragalus diminutivus var. diminutivus, commonly known as the dwarf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has a shallow root system and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
