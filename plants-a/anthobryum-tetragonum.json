    "intro": "Anthobryum tetragonum, commonly known as the four-cornered moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its erect, leafy shoots and closely spaced, quadrangular leaves that give it its common name. The leaves are typically narrow and have a distinctive four-sided cross-section when viewed in cross-section. This moss thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its simple morphology and ecological adaptability make it a common and widespread species in various habitats."
