    "intro": "Allophylus africanus, commonly known as the African holly, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 2 to 3 meters and features dense, leathery leaves that are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red or orange berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical gardens. Allophylus africanus is also valued for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
