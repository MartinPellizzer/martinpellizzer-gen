    "intro": "Asclepias navicularis var. compressidens, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States. It features slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, yellowish-green flowers with distinctive horn-shaped structures. It is a critical host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and supports a variety of pollinators. Its milky sap contains latex, which is toxic to some animals but essential for its ecological role."
