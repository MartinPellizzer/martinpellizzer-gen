    "intro": "Abutilon pycnodon, commonly known as the woolly abutilon, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces showy, lantern-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and often have a velvety texture. Abutilon pycnodon is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sunny conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon pycnodon is primarily native to Angola, Botswana, Cape Provinces, Namibia, Northern Provinces, and Zimbabwe. This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in shrublands and along riverbanks. The species is well adapted to the dry climate of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon pycnodon was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can spread rapidly through seed dispersal. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact."
