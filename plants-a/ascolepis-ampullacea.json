    "intro": "Ascolepis ampullacea, commonly known as the bottle-shaped lichen, is a unique species belonging to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, bottle-shaped thallus that is typically dark green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a crustose growth on rock surfaces, often in humid, shaded environments. It lacks true leaves and roots, relying on its thallus for nutrient absorption. Ascolepis ampullacea is a slow-growing lichen that plays a role in soil stabilization and serves as an indicator of air quality."
