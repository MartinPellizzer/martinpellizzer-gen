    "intro": "Acer spicatum f. americanum, commonly known as the American mountain maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas along streams and in mountainous regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates.",
