    "intro": "Akebia trifoliata, commonly known as the Japanese arrowroot or climbing false hop, is a deciduous vine native to East Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three heart-shaped leaflets, and its clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. Akebia trifoliata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained soil."
