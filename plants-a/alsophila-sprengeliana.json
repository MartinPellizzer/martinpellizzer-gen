    "intro": "Alsophila sprengeliana, commonly known as the Sprengel's tree fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting its upright growth habit. The fronds are bioluminescent in some species, though this feature is less common in Alsophila sprengeliana."
