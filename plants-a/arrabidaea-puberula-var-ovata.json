It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant typically grows in humid, tropical environments and is often found in forest understories. Its flowers are usually yellow or pale green, with a distinctive spurred structure, and it produces small, hairy seeds within its pods. This variety is notable for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a food source for certain insect species."
