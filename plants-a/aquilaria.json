    "intro": "Aquilaria, commonly known as agarwood, is a genus of evergreen trees native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic resinous heartwood, which is highly prized in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant belongs to the family Thymelaeaceae and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan. Aquilaria species are often cultivated for their unique scent, which develops when the wood is infected by a specific fungus. The plant's botanical significance lies in its chemical composition and ecological role in its native habitats."
