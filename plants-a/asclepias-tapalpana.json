    "intro": "Asclepias tapalpana, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, butterfly-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are typically opposite and oval-shaped, with a rough texture. Asclepias tapalpana plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing a host plant for their larvae."
