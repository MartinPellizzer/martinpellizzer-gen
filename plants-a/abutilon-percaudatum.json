This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or forested habitats. The species is known for its distinctive foliage and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. Its native range reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of Central America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon percaudatum was mainly introduced to Hawaii. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and adaptability. The plant has since spread to other tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of the Pacific Islands and Southeast Asia. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions, where it can outcompete native vegetation."
