    "intro": "Ajuga pyramidalis var. meonantha, commonly known as the creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial groundcover plant native to Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped, glossy dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in early to mid-summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. Its rapid growth and ability to spread make it effective for erosion control and ground cover in gardens."
