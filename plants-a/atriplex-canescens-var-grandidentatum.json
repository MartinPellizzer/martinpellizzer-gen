    "intro": "Atriplex canescens var. grandidentatum, commonly known as silverleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a distinctive, toothed margin. This species is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable plant for stabilizing desert landscapes."
