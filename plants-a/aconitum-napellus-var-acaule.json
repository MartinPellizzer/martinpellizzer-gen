    "intro": "Aconitum napellus var. acaule, commonly known as the naked stem monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in late summer. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and lacks a distinct stem, giving it its \"naked stem\" variety name. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed segments that are dark green and hairy. The plant contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling.",
