    "intro": "Aspalathus sericea, commonly known as silver bush, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, fine hairs covering the leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, bean-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to a Mediterranean climate with mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers. Aspalathus sericea is often used in traditional medicine and is also cultivated as an ornamental plant."
