    "intro": "Ajuga foliosa, commonly known as creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped, bright green leaves that are often variegated with yellow or white markings. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Ajuga foliosa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in ground cover due to its vigorous growth habit. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to suppress weeds in woodland gardens."
