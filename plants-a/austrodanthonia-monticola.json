It typically grows in coastal and inland regions, often found on sandy soils and rocky outcrops. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is drought-tolerant and adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Austrodanthonia monticola plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
