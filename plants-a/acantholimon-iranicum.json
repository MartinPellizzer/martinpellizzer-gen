    "intro": "Acantholimon iranicum, commonly known as the Iranian thornweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Iran. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, hairy stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. It has narrow, fleshy leaves that help conserve water, a feature common in xerophytic species. Acantholimon iranicum is often found in alpine and subalpine zones, where it thrives in well-drained soils.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon iranicum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in the Iranian Plateau and adjacent areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and on slopes. This plant is well adapted to the harsh climate of its native habitat, which includes high altitudes and significant temperature fluctuations. It is commonly found in alpine and subalpine zones, where it contributes to local biodiversity. Due to its specific ecological requirements, its distribution is relatively limited to these particular regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon iranicum was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils, particularly in mountainous areas. It thrives in environments with moderate rainfall and full sun exposure. This plant is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control. Its introduction has been noted in parts of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is valued for its ornamental value and ability to withstand drought conditions."
