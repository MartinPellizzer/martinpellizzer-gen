    "intro": "Achoriphragma, commonly known as the African daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that come in a variety of colors. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Achoriphragma species are often used in ornamental gardening due to their hardiness and ability to thrive in various soil conditions. They are also valued for their ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
