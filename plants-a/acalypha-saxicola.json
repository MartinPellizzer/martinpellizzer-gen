    "intro": "Acalypha saxicola, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to harsh environments. Its structure is low-growing, with a sprawling habit that helps it conserve moisture. Acalypha saxicola is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.",

The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. It is commonly seen in desert environments and along dry slopes. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within the northwest part of Mexico.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha saxicola was mainly introduced to rocky and coastal habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in areas with moderate to high sunlight exposure. This plant is often seen growing on cliffs, rock outcrops, and along shores. Its introduction has been documented in several regions, including parts of the Pacific Islands and coastal areas of Southeast Asia. It is considered an invasive species in some locations due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
