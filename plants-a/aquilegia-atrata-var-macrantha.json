It features showy, hood-shaped flowers that are typically deep purple or violet in color, with intricate patterns inside the petals. The plant has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are dark green and covered in a fine layer of hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
