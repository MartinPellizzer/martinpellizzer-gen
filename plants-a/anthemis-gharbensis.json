    "intro": "Anthemis gharbensis, commonly known as the Kashmiri tansy, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small yellow to golden-orange flowers that are often arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Anthemis gharbensis is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory effects."
