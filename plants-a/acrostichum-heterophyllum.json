    "intro": "Acrostichum heterophyllum, commonly known as the broad-leaf fern, is a member of the family Davalliaceae and is native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, leathery, compound leaves that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive arrangement of pinnae that are often broadly ovate. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of ferns.",
