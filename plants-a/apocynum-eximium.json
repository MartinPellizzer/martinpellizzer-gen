The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in summer, which are followed by cylindrical, green berries that turn red as they mature. Its roots contain toxic compounds, making it a plant with both ecological and medicinal significance. Apocynum eximium is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
