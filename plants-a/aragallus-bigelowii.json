    "intro": "Aragallus bigelowii, commonly known as the bigelow's aragallus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid environment to thrive. Its unique morphology includes strap-like leaves and a short, sturdy stem that supports its delicate inflorescence. Due to its restricted habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
