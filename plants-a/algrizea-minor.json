    "intro": "Algrizea minor, commonly known as the silverleaf spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features succulent, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are fleshy and contain a milky sap, which can be toxic to some animals. Algrizea minor is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
