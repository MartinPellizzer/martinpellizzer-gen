    "intro": "Astragalus iliensis, commonly known as the Ili Valley milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia, particularly found in the Ili River Valley in China. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils, often in mountainous regions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, and its leaves are compound, consisting of several small leaflets. Astragalus iliensis is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. It is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological role and potential medicinal properties."
