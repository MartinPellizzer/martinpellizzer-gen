    "intro": "Anthurium oxystachyum, commonly known as the red anthurium, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped spathes that range in color from deep red to orange, often with a contrasting green or yellow midrib. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spadices that contain the actual flowers, which are typically green or white. It thrives in humid, warm environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Anthurium oxystachyum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
