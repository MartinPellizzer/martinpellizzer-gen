    "intro": "Asterostigma vermicida, commonly known as the worm-leaf aster, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaf arrangement. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are typically small and clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is sometimes found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
