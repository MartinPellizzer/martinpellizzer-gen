    "intro": "Anemia tripinnata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately divided into three parts, giving it the species name *tripinnata*. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its wood is highly valued for its rich reddish color and durability, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts and furniture. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered in many regions."
