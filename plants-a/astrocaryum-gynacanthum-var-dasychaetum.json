    "intro": "Astrocaryum gynacanthum var. dasychaetum, commonly known as the thick-shelled coconut palm, is a species native to the Amazon Basin. It is a tall, slender palm with a smooth, dark green trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces heavy, woody fruits that contain a single, large seed. Its leaves are often used for thatching and weaving, while the trunk is valued for its durable, heavy wood. This variety is characterized by its dense, fibrous husk and is adapted to wet, tropical environments."
