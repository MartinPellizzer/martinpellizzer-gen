It is native to the eastern Himalayas and is characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored pods that resemble those of true cardamom. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers followed by elongated, spathaceous bracts that enclose the fruiting structures. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and have a smooth texture with a strong, spicy aroma. The plant is valued for its unique flavor and is used in both culinary and medicinal applications."
