    "intro": "Agrostis ecklonis, commonly known as coastal grass or beach grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color. Agrostis ecklonis is well adapted to sandy soils and salt spray, making it a common sight in coastal dunes and shorelines. Its ability to stabilize sand dunes makes it ecologically significant in coastal ecosystems."
