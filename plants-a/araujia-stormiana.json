It is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night and close during the day. The plant produces showy, lantern-shaped blooms that are often used in ornamental gardening. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a velvety texture. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
