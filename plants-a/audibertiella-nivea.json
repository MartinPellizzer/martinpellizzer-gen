    "intro": "Audibertiella nivea, commonly known as the white moss polypore, is a rare and delicate fungal species belonging to the family Polyporaceae. It is characterized by its pale, sponge-like cap that often appears on dead wood in temperate forests. The fungus has a unique appearance with a smooth, white to cream-colored surface and a distinctive, fibrous texture. It is typically found growing in association with coniferous trees, particularly in humid environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable indicator of healthy, undisturbed forest ecosystems."
