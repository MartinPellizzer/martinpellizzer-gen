    "intro": "Avena flexuosa montana, commonly known as mountain bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, often tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
