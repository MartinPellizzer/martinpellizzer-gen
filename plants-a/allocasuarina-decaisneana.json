    "intro": "Allocasuarina decaisneana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sheoak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, needle-like leaves that are clustered in spirals around the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spherical cones that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. Allocasuarina decaisneana is well adapted to dry conditions and can tolerate salt spray, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
