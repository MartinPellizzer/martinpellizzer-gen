It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spadix-like inflorescence surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its common name. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, relying on insects for pollination."
