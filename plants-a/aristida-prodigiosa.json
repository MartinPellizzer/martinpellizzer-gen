    "intro": "Aristida prodigiosa, commonly known as the prodigal grass, is a flowering plant species native to South America. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to brown in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue due to the presence of dense, fine hairs. Aristida prodigiosa is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
