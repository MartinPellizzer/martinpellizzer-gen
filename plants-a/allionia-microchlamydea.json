    "intro": "Allionia microchlamydea, commonly known as the dwarf allionia, is a small herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
