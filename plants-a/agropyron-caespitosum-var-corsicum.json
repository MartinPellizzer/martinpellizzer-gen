It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps it thrive in rocky and arid environments. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing stems. This variety is valued for its erosion control capabilities and is often used in landscaping and restoration projects."
