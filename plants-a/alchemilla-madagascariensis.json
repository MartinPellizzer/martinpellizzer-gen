    "intro": "Alchemilla madagascariensis, commonly known as the Madagascan lady's mantle, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant features hairy stems and possesses a succulent, fleshy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its leaves are often covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Alchemilla madagascariensis is typically found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun conditions."
