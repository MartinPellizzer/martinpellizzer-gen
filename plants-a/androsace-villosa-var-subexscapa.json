    "intro": "Androsace villosa var. subexscapa, commonly known as the hairy androsace, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features a rosette of hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers arranged in a cluster at the center of the rosette. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes."
