    "intro": "Angraecum macilentum, commonly known as the slender angraecum, is a rare and delicate orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, pale green to white flowers that bloom at night. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers emit a strong scent to attract nocturnal pollinators like moths. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
