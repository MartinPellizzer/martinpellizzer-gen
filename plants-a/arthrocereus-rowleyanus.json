    "intro": "Arthrocereus rowleyanus, commonly known as the ice plant or moon cactus, is a flowering cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its short, thick stems and small, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, adding a unique aesthetic to its appearance. Its succulent nature makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance requirements. The plant's ability to thrive in well-draining soil and minimal water makes it ideal for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
