It is characterized by its striking white or pale green leaves that contrast sharply with its dark green veins. This form is a natural mutation of the species, often found in specific geographic regions. The leaves are typically larger and more elongated compared to the standard variety. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.",
