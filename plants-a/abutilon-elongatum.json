    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon elongatum is primarily native to Central and South America, including regions such as Mexico, Brazil, and parts of the Caribbean. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. This plant thrives in warm climates with moderate to high humidity. It is also known to occur in some parts of southern North America, particularly in the southern United States. Its natural range extends into regions with a variety of soil types, making it adaptable to different environments.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon elongatum was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in coastal and disturbed areas. It is considered a potential weed in some parts of the country. Its spread is often associated with human activities such as gardening and land clearing."
