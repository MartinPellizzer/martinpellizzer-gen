    "intro": "Aloe trichosantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features tall, branching stems that produce clusters of fleshy, spiny leaves. The leaves are typically narrow and covered with a whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss. It produces yellow flowers in summer, which are borne on branched inflorescences. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional medicine."
