    "intro": "Aloe minima var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf aloe or miniature aloe, is a small, succulent plant native to South Africa. It features compact rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers on tall, slender stems during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and requiring minimal watering. Due to its ornamental value and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor and rock garden settings."
