    "intro": "Abies grandis var. densifolia, commonly known as the dense-foliage fir, is a variant of the grand fir native to western North America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and conical shape, which makes it a striking ornamental plant. The needles are short and stiff, often arranged in crossed pairs, giving the tree a distinctive appearance. It thrives in cooler, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. This variant is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is commonly used in landscaping and reforestation projects.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies grandis var. densifolia is primarily native to the western coast of North America, specifically in regions of western Canada and the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is found in areas such as British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and northern California. This variety thrives in moist, cool climates and is commonly found in mountainous and subalpine forests. It is often associated with other coniferous species and grows in well-drained soils. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones where it can receive adequate moisture and sunlight.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies grandis var. densifolia was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically in higher elevation regions. It is often found in coniferous forests where it forms part of the understory vegetation. This variety is particularly adapted to environments with high humidity and moderate temperatures. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range for ornamental and reforestation purposes. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems."
