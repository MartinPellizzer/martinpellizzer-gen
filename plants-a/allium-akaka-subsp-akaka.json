It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of broad, strap-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
