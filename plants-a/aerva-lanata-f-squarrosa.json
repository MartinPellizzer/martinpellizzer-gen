    "intro": "Aerva lanata f. squarrosa, commonly known as the hairy sida, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial species characterized by its slender stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate in shape and covered with fine, hairy texture, which helps in reducing water loss. The plant is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine systems."
