    "intro": "Aristolochia racemosa, commonly known as Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, tubular, vine-like flowers that resemble a pipe, with a deep purple to brown coloration. The plant produces heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves that are often hairy and have a strong, unpleasant odor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The species is also known for its medicinal properties, though it contains toxic compounds that can be harmful to humans and animals."
