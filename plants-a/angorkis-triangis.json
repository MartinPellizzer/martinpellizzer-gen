    "intro": "Angorkis triangis, commonly known as the three-angled orchid, is a unique flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive triangular-shaped leaves and striking violet-blue flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its root system is specialized for absorbing nutrients from the rocky substrates where it grows. Due to its habitat specificity, Angorkis triangis is considered a rare and endangered species."
