    "intro": "Astilbe senanensis, commonly known as the Senan Mountain Astilbe, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and clusters of delicate, lace-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink, white, or purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its foliage consists of heart-shaped, serrated leaves that are a deep green, providing a striking contrast to its floral display. Astilbe senanensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial to full shade."
