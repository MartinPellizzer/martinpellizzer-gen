    "intro": "Asclepias foliosa, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Asclepias foliosa is a host plant for the monarch butterfly and other milkweed-dependent species, making it ecologically significant. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds that deter herbivores, contributing to its survival in arid environments."
