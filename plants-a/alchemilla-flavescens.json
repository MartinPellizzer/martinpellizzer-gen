    "intro": "Alchemilla flavescens, commonly known as yellow lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties. Alchemilla flavescens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow environments."
