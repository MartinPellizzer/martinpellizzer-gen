    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthophippium javanicum is primarily native to Borneo, Jawa, Lesser Sunda Is., Malaya, and Sumatera. This plant is commonly found in tropical rainforest environments across these regions. It thrives in humid and shaded conditions, often growing along riverbanks or in dense undergrowth. The species is well adapted to the diverse ecosystems of Southeast Asia. Its natural range reflects its ecological significance in the local flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthophippium javanicum was mainly introduced to new habitats in Southeast Asia, particularly in regions with tropical and subtropical climates. It has been observed in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. The plant is often found in disturbed areas, including roadsides and agricultural fields. Its introduction is likely due to human activities, such as accidental transport through trade or intentional planting for ornamental purposes. However, its ecological impact remains under study due to limited data on its spread and interactions with native flora."
