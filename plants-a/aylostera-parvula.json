    "intro": "Aylostera parvula, commonly known as the small aylostera, is a small shrub native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the cooler months. Aylostera parvula is often found in rocky or well-drained soils at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
