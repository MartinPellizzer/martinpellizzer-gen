    "intro": "Anaphalis viscida, commonly known as the sticky anaphalis, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is known for its woolly, hairy leaves and stems, which help reduce water loss in its high-altitude habitat. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in clusters, often giving the plant a fluffy appearance. Anaphalis viscida is adapted to cold, dry environments and is often found in alpine meadows."
