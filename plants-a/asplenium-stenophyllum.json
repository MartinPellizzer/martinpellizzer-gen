    "intro": "Asplenium stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. This plant is often found growing in rocky or crevice habitats, preferring moist and shaded environments. Asplenium stenophyllum has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in crevices and absorb nutrients from the surrounding substrate. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
