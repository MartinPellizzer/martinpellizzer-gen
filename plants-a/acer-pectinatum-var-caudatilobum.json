    "intro": "Acer pectinatum var. caudatilobum, commonly known as the long-tailed maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated lobes on the leaves, which give it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are small and greenish-yellow, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The tree produces samaras, or winged seeds, which aid in its dispersal.",
