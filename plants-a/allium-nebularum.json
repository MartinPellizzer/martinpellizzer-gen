    "intro": "Allium nebularum, commonly known as the nebular garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves and clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces edible bulbs that are similar in taste to garlic but are less commonly cultivated. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
