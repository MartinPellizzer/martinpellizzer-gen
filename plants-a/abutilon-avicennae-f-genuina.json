    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon avicennae f. genuina is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and South Africa. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. It is commonly found in dune environments and is adapted to the harsh, saline conditions of the coastal areas. The species is well-suited to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range. Its distribution is limited to specific coastal habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon avicennae f. genuina was mainly introduced to coastal and sandy habitats, particularly in regions with warm, temperate climates. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing along shores, dunes, and rocky outcrops. This plant is commonly associated with disturbed areas and can establish itself in both natural and human-altered environments. Its introduction has been documented in several coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to stabilize sand dunes."
