    "intro": "Ardisia impressa var. grandiens, commonly known as the broad-leafed ardisia, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries that are edible but often used as ornamental features. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal. The leaves and berries contain compounds that have been studied for their potential medicinal properties."
