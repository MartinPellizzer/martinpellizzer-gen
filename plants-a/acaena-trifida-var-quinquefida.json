It is found in the North Island and the South Island, particularly in the northern and central regions. This species thrives in coastal and inland areas, often in rocky or sandy soils. It is commonly associated with open vegetation types such as shrublands and grasslands. The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate and is an important part of New Zealand's native flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena trifida var. quinquefida was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and small, showy flowers. However, it has since become naturalized and is now considered a weed in some areas. The plant spreads through its seeds, which are dispersed by animals and water. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native ecosystems."
