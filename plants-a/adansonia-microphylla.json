The tree has small, leathery leaves and produces yellow, clustered flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its fruit, known as a \"monkey bread,\" is edible and contains a pulp rich in nutrients. The plant plays a significant ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various species.",
