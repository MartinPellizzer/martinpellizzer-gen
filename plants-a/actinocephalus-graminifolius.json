    "intro": "Actinocephalus graminifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf actinocephalus, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a dense, terminal head, which gives it its common name. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens.",
