    "intro": "Astragalus krugeanus var. kurdomerensis, commonly known as the Kurdomer milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its conservation status is of concern due to habitat loss and over-collection."
