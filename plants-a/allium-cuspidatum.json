    "intro": "Allium cuspidatum, commonly known as the purple onion or purple garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of violet or purple flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant's bulbs are edible, though they have a more intense flavor compared to common onions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Allium cuspidatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
