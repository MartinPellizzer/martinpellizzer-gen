    "intro": "Athyrium filix-femina var. multidentatum, commonly known as the Japanese male fern, is a variant of the female fern species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that exhibit a distinctive bipinnate structure, with each pinna further divided into smaller, serrated segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides, preferring well-drained, loamy soils. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
