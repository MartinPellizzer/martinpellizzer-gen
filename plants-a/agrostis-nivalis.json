    "intro": "Agrostis nivalis, commonly known as snowgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in cold, alpine environments. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and is often found in rocky soils at high elevations. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to withstand harsh winters and has a mat-forming growth habit. Snowgrass plays an important role in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions and is a component of alpine vegetation."
