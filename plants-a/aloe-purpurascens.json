It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a reddish or purple tinge, especially under stress or in full sun. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences with yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that is sometimes used for its soothing properties. Aloe purpurascens is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil and full sunlight."
