    "intro": "Asterocephalus grandiflorus, commonly known as the grandiflorous starhead, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters at the top of its slender, branching stems. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It is typically found growing in rocky soils and is often associated with specific microhabitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
