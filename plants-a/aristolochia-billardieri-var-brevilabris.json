    "intro": "Aristolochia billardieri var. brevilabris, commonly known as the narrow-lipped Dutchman's pipe, is a tropical vine characterized by its unique, tubular, maroon-colored flowers. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and emits a mild, sometimes unpleasant odor to attract its pollinators. It is native to the Caribbean and thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil. The flowers are specifically adapted to be pollinated by certain species of flies, making it an interesting example of specialized pollination. Its ornamental value has made it a popular plant in botanical gardens and private collections."
