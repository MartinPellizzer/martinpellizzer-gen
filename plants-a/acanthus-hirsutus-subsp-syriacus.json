The plant is known for its ornate foliage and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. Its native range reflects its adaptation to the arid and semi-arid environments of the Levant.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus hirsutus subsp. syriacus was mainly introduced to regions with Mediterranean climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. It is commonly found in gardens and horticultural collections due to its ornamental value. This subspecies is known for its distinctive, palmate leaves and spiny, lavender-colored flowers. It has been cultivated in parts of Europe and North America as a decorative plant. However, it is considered invasive in some areas, where it can outcompete native vegetation."
