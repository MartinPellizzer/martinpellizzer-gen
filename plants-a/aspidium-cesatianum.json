    "intro": "Aspidium cesatianum, commonly known as the European water fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant has a rhizomatous structure and produces small, clustered fronds with a delicate, lace-like appearance. Its sporangia are borne on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Aspidium cesatianum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
