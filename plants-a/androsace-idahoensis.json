    "intro": "Androsace idahoensis, commonly known as Idaho sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Idaho and Montana. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. Androsace idahoensis is well adapted to cold climates and is an important component of the high-elevation flora in its native range."
