    "intro": "Athyrium nitidulum, commonly known as the glossy wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in a waxy, glossy coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of spore-bearing leaves. The botanical features of Athyrium nitidulum make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in shaded areas."
