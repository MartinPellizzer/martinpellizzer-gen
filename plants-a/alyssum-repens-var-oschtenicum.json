    "intro": "Alyssum repens var. oschtenicum, commonly known as the creeping alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in spring and early summer. The plant has succulent, hairy leaves that are often bluish-green in appearance, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value. This variety is particularly noted for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
