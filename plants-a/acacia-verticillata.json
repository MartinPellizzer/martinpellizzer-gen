    "intro": "Acacia verticillata, commonly known as the weeping acacia, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive pendulous branches that give it a drooping appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in winter, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are feathery and arranged in whorls, contributing to its ornamental value. Acacia verticillata is adapted to arid environments and is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and aesthetic appeal.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia verticillata is primarily native to New South Wales, South Australia, Tasmania, and Victoria. This shrub is commonly found in dry, sandy soils across these regions. It thrives in open woodlands and grasslands, often in areas with low rainfall. The plant is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and soil stabilization.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia verticillata was mainly introduced to California, Colombia, India, Madeira, New Zealand North, and New Zealand South. It has been established in these regions, often as an ornamental or for erosion control. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is adaptable to different climates. Its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in some areas. It is commonly found in disturbed sites and along roadsides in its introduced range."
