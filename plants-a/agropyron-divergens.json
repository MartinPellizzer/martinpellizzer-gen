    "intro": "Agropyron divergens, commonly known as the wheatgrasses, is a genus of grasses that includes several species adapted to a variety of environments. It is characterized by its robust growth and ability to thrive in arid or semi-arid regions. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, spike-like inflorescences. Agropyron divergens is often found in disturbed soils and can be an important component of pioneer vegetation. Some species within this genus are used for forage or in ecological restoration projects due to their hardiness and resilience."
