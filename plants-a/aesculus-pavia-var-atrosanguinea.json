It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range from deep red to purple, which appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces large, spiny capsules containing bright orange, hairy seeds. Its leaves are compound, with 5 to 9 ovate leaflets that are dark green and often have a slightly serrated edge.
