    "intro": "Allagopappus chrysopsioides, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with woody stems and narrow, gray-green leaves adapted to conserve water. It produces bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils make it well-suited for xeriscaping and restoration projects in dry environments."
