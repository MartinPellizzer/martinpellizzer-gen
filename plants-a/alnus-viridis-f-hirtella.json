    "intro": "Alnus viridis f. hirtella, commonly known as the hairy alder, is a shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins that are typically male, while female flowers are found on the same plant. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. This subspecies is notable for its role in nitrogen fixation, making it valuable for soil enrichment."
