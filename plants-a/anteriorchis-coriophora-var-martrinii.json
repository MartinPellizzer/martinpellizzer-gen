    "intro": "Anteriorchis coriophora var. martrinii, commonly known as the Martrinii variant of the Coriophora plant, is a rare and specialized species within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which are arranged in umbels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
