    "intro": "Abuta rufescens, commonly known as the red abuta, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its striking red and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is adapted to the cool, humid climates of its native habitat. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections.",

It is found in the tropical regions of South America, particularly in areas with moist, humid climates. This plant typically grows in lowland forests and along riverbanks. It is commonly found in regions with rich soil and adequate rainfall. Its native range spans across several countries in northern and eastern South America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abuta rufescens was mainly introduced to regions with temperate to subtropical climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. It is commonly found in the wild in parts of Asia, particularly in China, India, and Southeast Asia. This plant has also been cultivated in some parts of the United States and Europe for its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties. Its introduction to new areas has raised concerns about its invasive potential in certain ecosystems. Due to its adaptability, it has become a subject of ecological studies to understand its impact on local flora."
