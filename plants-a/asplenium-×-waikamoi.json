    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 waikamoi, commonly known as the Waikamoi spleenwort, is a hybrid fern native to Hawaii. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves that are often clustered at the base. The plant typically grows on rock surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, showcasing its epiphytic or lithophytic growth habits. Its small, spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
