    "intro": "Anagallis marryattae, commonly known as the pink evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, which open in the late afternoon and remain open through the night. Its scientific name honors the British botanist Mary Atterbury, who contributed to the study of evening primroses. The species is notable for its unique pollination strategy, relying on nocturnal moths for reproduction."
