    "intro": "Asplenium petersenii, commonly known as Petersen's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes and produces delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a serrated margin. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves. Asplenium petersenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
