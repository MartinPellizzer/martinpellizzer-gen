    "intro": "Ancistrocladus harmandii, commonly known as the African poisonwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Ancistrocladaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are avoided by most animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically used for medicinal or ornamental purposes."
