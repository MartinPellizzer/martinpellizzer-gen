    "intro": "Alpagrostis alpina var. flavescens, commonly known as the golden alpine grass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spikelets that are often tinged with yellow or golden hues, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. This variety is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions."
