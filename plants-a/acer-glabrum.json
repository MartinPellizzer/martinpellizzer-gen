    "intro": "Acer glabrum, commonly known as the smooth maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Acer glabrum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in forest ecosystems.",
