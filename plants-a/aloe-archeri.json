It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick, fleshy, and covered in a white powdery substance called farina. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that has been used for its soothing properties. Aloe archeri thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
