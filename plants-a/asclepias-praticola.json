    "intro": "Asclepias praticola, commonly known as showy milkweed, is a species of milkweed native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces follicles that contain seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Its foliage is typically oval-shaped with a fuzzy texture, and it is a host plant for monarch butterfly larvae. Asclepias praticola is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in gardens."
