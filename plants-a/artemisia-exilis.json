    "intro": "Artemisia exilis, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Artemisia exilis is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It is valued in traditional medicine for its aromatic properties and is also used in landscaping for its ornamental appeal."
