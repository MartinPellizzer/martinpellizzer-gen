    "intro": "Abies concolor f. violacea, commonly known as the violet-silver fir, is a rare alpine plant characterized by its distinctive foliage. Its leaves are a striking combination of silver-white and deep violet, creating a unique visual effect. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions with cool, moist conditions. It is a variant of the white fir, exhibiting genetic variations that result in its unique coloration. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies concolor f. violacea is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in regions of California, Nevada, and northern Arizona. This subspecies is typically found in high-elevation areas, such as mountainous regions and subalpine forests. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils. The plant is often associated with mixed coniferous forests and is adapted to the harsh climate of its native range. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones that provide the necessary conditions for its growth.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies concolor f. violacea was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage coloration. The distribution includes areas in Washington, Oregon, and northern California. It is commonly found in urban and suburban landscapes. However, it is not native to these regions and has limited natural spread."
