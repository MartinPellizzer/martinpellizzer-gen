    "intro": "Alopecurus angustifolius, commonly known as narrowleaf mouseear, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, hairless stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence bears numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Alopecurus angustifolius is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator habitats."
