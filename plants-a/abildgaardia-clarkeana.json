    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abildgaardia clarkeana is primarily native to the eastern Himalayas, including regions in India, Nepal, and Bhutan. It is commonly found in moist, shaded forest environments at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. This plant thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil, often growing along stream banks or in rocky crevices. It is a rare and delicate species, typically found in specific microhabitats within its native range. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abildgaardia clarkeana was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. Despite its ornamental value, it has since become invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native species for resources. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and can spread rapidly through vegetative propagation. Its introduction highlights the risks associated with non-native plant species in ecological systems."
