    "intro": "Aporum sagittatum, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Central and South America. It features arrow-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface, adapted for water environments. The plant thrives in shallow, slow-moving water and can grow up to several feet in height. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits. Aporum sagittatum is popular in aquariums and wetland restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and provide habitat for aquatic life."
