    "intro": "Artemisia achilleifolia, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and small, yellowish-green flower heads. The plant contains volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its strong medicinal and pesticidal properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its chemical composition, it has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
