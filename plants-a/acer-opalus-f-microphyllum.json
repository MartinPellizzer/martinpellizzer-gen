    "intro": "Acer opalus f. microphyllum, commonly known as the miniature maple, is a compact, slow-growing shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically a vibrant green during the growing season and turn yellow or red in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticulturists.",
