    "intro": "Aloe bequaertii, commonly known as the White Aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking, tall flower spikes with white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Aloe bequaertii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in rocky or sandy soils."
