    "intro": "Armeria maritima subsp. pungens, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and clusters of pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along rocky coastlines. Its leaves are linear and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in saline environments. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal soils."
