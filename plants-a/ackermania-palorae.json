    "intro": "Ackermania palorae, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its pale green, leafless stems and small, delicate white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, making it highly dependent on its environment. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of botanical interest and conservation concern. Ackermania palorae thrives in wetlands and pine flatwoods, where it often grows on the roots of trees.",
