It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and is often found in temperate climates. Agropyron ligusticum is valued for its role in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity in its native ecosystems."
