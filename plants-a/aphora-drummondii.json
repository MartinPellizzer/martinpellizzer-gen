    "intro": "Aphora drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's aphora, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring or early summer. Aphora drummondii typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open grasslands or along streambanks. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
