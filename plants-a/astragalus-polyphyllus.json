    "intro": "Astragalus polyphyllus, commonly known as the many-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often divided into numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Astragalus polyphyllus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
