    "intro": "Atriplex patula var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-seeded saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, lobed leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it a valuable species for stabilizing soils in saline or degraded areas. The variety macrocarpa is distinguished by its larger, more prominent seeds compared to the typical form of Atriplex patula."
