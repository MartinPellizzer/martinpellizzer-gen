    "intro": "Aristolochia hookeriana, commonly known as the Hooker's Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to South America. It is characterized by its unique, heart-shaped leaves and its striking, pipe-shaped flowers that are often pale green or brownish in color. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy, orange aril. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it should be handled with care as it contains toxic compounds."
