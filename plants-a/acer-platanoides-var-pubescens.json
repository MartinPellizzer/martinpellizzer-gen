    "intro": "Acer platanoides var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy Norway maple, is a variant of the Norway maple native to Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive hairy foliage, which gives it a unique appearance compared to the typical Norway maple. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a serrated margin and a lighter green underside. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks.",
