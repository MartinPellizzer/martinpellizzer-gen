    "intro": "Abutilon tiubae f. annuum, commonly known as the woolly abutilon, is a variant of the abutilon plant characterized by its soft, fuzzy foliage and showy, lantern-shaped flowers. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with alternate, heart-shaped leaves.

It thrives in humid, warm climates with well-drained soils, often found in lowland areas and near riverbanks. This plant is commonly associated with disturbed habitats, including secondary forests and agricultural lands. Its native distribution includes parts of Central and South America, where it grows as a shrub or small tree. It is an important species in local ecosystems and has been used traditionally for various purposes.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon tiubae f. annuum was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers and unique foliage. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its aesthetic value in gardens and public spaces. The plant thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Its introduction has been primarily through horticultural trade and botanical collections. However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it is grown."
