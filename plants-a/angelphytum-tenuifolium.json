    "intro": "Angelphytum tenuifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf angelphytum, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features delicate, linear leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter wide, giving it a grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
