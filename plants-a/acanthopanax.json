It is characterized by its climbing or shrub-like growth habit and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. Many species are native to Asia, particularly China, Korea, and Japan, and are often found in forested areas.

Some species are valued for their potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and adaptogenic effects."
