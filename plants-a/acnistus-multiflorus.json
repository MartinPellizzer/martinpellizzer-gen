    "intro": "Acnistus multiflorus, commonly known as the many-flowered acnistus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, round fruits that contain a single seed. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of light conditions, making it adaptable to different environments. Botanically, it is characterized by its simple, branching structure and its ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative propagation.",
