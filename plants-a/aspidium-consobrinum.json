    "intro": "Aspidium consobrinum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent in certain conditions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water bodies such as streams and wetlands. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium consobrinum plays an important ecological role in maintaining wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling."
