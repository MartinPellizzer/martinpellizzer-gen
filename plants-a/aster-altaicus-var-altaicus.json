It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid climates. The Altai aster is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
