    "intro": "Aristeguietia arborea, commonly known as the Andean tree fern, is a member of the Cyatheaceae family and is native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant exhibits a unique growth habit, with a single trunk that remains relatively smooth and unbranched throughout its life. Its fronds are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a leathery texture. Aristeguietia arborea plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
