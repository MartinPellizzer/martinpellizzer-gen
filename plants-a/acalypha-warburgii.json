    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha warburgii is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. The plant is also present in parts of the Arabian Peninsula and the Indian subcontinent. It is commonly found in humid lowland areas with well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions outside its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha warburgii was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through vegetative reproduction. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems."
