    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha grandispicata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of the Philippines and Papua New Guinea. Its distribution is largely confined to the Indo-Malesian region, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha grandispicata was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along stream banks. This plant is commonly used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and showy flowers. It has been reported as an invasive species in several regions where it outcompetes native vegetation. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a challenging weed to control in agricultural and natural ecosystems."
