    "intro": "Alismorkis rosea, commonly known as the pink water plant, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It features slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. The plant produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, adding ornamental value to ponds and wetlands. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and prefers partial to full sun exposure. Alismorkis rosea is often used in water gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
