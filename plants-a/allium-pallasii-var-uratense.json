It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant is characterized by its distinct, bulbous stem that stores nutrients and water, typical of many Allium species. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated by gardeners interested in native and hardy plants."
