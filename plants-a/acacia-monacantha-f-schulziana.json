    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia monacantha f. schulziana is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa. It is found in regions such as the Eastern Cape, Western Cape, and parts of KwaZulu-Natal. This plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coast and in fynbos vegetation. It is commonly found in coastal areas and is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region. The species is also known to occur in neighboring countries like Namibia and Mozambique.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia monacantha f. schulziana was mainly introduced to areas with a tropical and subtropical climate, characterized by warm temperatures and well-distributed rainfall. It thrives in regions with loose, sandy, or loamy soils that are well-drained. This plant is commonly found in coastal dunes, open woodlands, and disturbed sites where it can establish quickly. Its introduction has been associated with ornamental horticulture and reforestation efforts in various parts of the world. However, in some regions, it has become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems."
