    "intro": "Anemone coelestina, commonly known as the sky anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are alternate and often covered in a soft, hairy texture. Its root system consists of rhizomes that help it survive in harsh, rocky environments. Anemone coelestina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, ethereal appearance."
