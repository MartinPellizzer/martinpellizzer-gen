    "intro": "Avenastrum convolutum, commonly known as the twisted wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact, spiky inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, contributing to its ability to colonize remote and challenging habitats. Avenastrum convolutum is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
