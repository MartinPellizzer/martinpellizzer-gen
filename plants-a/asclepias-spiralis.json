    "intro": "Asclepias spiralis, commonly known as the spiral milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces distinctive, spiraling leaves that give it its common name, and it is a member of the milkweed family, Apocynaceae. Asclepias spiralis is known for its ability to thrive in arid and rocky soils, making it well adapted to desert environments. It also serves as a host plant for the monarch butterfly, supporting its life cycle."
