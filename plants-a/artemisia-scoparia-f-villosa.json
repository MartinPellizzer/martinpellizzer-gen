    "intro": "Artemisia scoparia f. villosa, commonly known as woolly wormwood, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its grayish-green, densely hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are typically borne on slender, branched stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its aromatic properties, it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine and as a source of essential oils."
