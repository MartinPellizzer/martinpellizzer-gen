    "intro": "Aphyllodium stylosanthoides, commonly known as the pink ghost flower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its unique, showy inflorescences that resemble ghostly shapes, which give it its common name. The plant has reduced leaves, with most of its photosynthetic function carried out by its stems. It produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically from late winter to spring. Aphyllodium stylosanthoides is adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in sandy soils."
