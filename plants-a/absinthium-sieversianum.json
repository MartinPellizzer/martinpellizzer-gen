    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Absinthium sieversianum is primarily native to the Caucasus region, including parts of Russia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan. It is commonly found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with rocky or alpine habitats. It is also present in some regions of Turkey and northern Iran. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Absinthium sieversianum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and waste grounds. It thrives in temperate climates and is commonly found in regions with moderate rainfall. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas quickly. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems. It is often spread through seeds carried by wind, water, or human activity."
