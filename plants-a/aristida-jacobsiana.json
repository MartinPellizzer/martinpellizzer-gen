    "intro": "Aristida jacobsiana, commonly known as Jacobs' threeawn, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Aristida jacobsiana plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in arid environments."
