It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along streambanks. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, and its leaves are narrow with a bluish-gray sheen. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of spikelets, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
