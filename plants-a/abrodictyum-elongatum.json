    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abrodictyum elongatum is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa. It is found in the eastern and western parts of the country, including the provinces of KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga, and the Eastern Cape. This plant typically grows in rocky outcrops and open grasslands. It is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, with dry summers and wet winters. Abrodictyum elongatum is a member of the Asparagaceae family and is known for its attractive, sword-shaped leaves and flowering spikes.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrodictyum elongatum was mainly introduced to the eastern United States as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature. It has since spread into natural areas, particularly in the southeastern region, where it thrives in disturbed soils and sunny habitats. This distribution has raised concerns among conservationists because of its potential to outcompete native species. The plant is commonly found in wetlands, roadsides, and along riverbanks, where it can form dense stands. Its rapid growth and adaptability have made it a challenge for ecological management in some areas."
