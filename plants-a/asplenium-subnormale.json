    "intro": "Asplenium subnormale, commonly known as the common rock fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to various regions of Europe, Asia, and Africa. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices, woodlands, and stream banks. The plant has a compact rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky texture. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a distinctive pattern. Asplenium subnormale is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
