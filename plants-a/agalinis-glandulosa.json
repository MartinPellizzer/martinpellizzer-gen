    "intro": "Agalinis glandulosa, commonly known as the hairy false foxglove, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and disturbed soils, often forming dense clusters. Its showy, tubular flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom from late spring to early summer. Agalinis glandulosa is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
