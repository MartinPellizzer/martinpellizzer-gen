    "intro": "Alisma ranunculoides f. repens, commonly known as the creeping water plant, is a variant of the water plantain that thrives in wetland environments. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the ground and form dense mats. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, depending on water levels. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in clusters and are adapted for wind pollination. This subspecies is often found in marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams, contributing to aquatic ecosystem stability."
