    "intro": "Aspidium umbilicatum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches, and is often found in temperate regions. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. The fronds are pinnately divided, with small, ovate pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appearance."
