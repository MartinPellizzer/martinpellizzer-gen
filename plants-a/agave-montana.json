    "intro": "Agave montana, commonly known as the mountain agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick and fleshy. The leaves are typically blue-gray in color, with sharp, spiny margins. It produces tall flower stalks that bear white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom once in the plant's lifetime. Agave montana is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping."
