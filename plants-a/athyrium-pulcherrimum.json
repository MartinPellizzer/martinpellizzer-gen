    "intro": "Athyrium pulcherrimum, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species native to the eastern United States. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its large, deeply divided, bright green fronds that are often covered in a fine, golden fuzz. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients. The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
