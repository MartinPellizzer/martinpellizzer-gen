    "intro": "Aspidium haenkei, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in Africa, Asia, and Australia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that often grow in dense clusters. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium haenkei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
