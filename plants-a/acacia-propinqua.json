    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia propinqua is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Southwestern United States, including parts of Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. It is also found in northern Mexico, particularly in the states of Sonora and Chihuahua. This plant thrives in rocky soils and is commonly found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. It is well adapted to hot, dry climates and can tolerate poor soil conditions. Acacia propinqua is an important component of the local ecosystem, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia propinqua was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and provide shade in degraded landscapes. It is commonly found in areas with poor soil quality and arid conditions. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in harsh environments with minimal water requirements. Its introduction has helped in stabilizing soil and promoting the growth of other vegetation. However, it has also raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems."
