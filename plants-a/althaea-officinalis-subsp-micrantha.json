    "intro": "Althaea officinalis subsp. micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marshmallow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically smaller than those of the typical species. The plant produces pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous small seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its mucilage-rich roots, which have been used in traditional medicine for their soothing properties."
