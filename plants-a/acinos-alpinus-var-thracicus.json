    "intro": "Acinos alpinus var. thracicus, commonly known as the Thrace alpine cinquefoil, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.",
