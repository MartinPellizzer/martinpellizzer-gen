    "intro": "Arthratherum stipoides, commonly known as the slender basket grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a compact growth habit. Arthratherum stipoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
