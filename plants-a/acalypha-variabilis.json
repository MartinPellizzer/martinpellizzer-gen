    "intro": "Acalypha variabilis, commonly known as the variable spurflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that often resemble flowers. The plant typically grows as an herb or shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are usually alternate, simple, and vary in shape, contributing to its common name. Acalypha variabilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes.",

This species is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these South American countries. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and riverbanks. The plant is well adapted to the humid climate and fertile soils of its native range. Its distribution reflects its preference for warm, humid conditions with adequate moisture.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha variabilis was mainly introduced to new environments as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability. It has been reported in several regions outside its native range, including parts of the United States and Australia. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils have contributed to its spread in these areas. However, it is considered invasive in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation. Its distribution is often linked to human activities such as gardening and landscaping."
