    "intro": "Aspidium organense, commonly known as the organensis water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinct midrib and small, ovate pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically clustered on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium organense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic or semi-aquatic gardens."
