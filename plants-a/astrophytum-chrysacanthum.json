It is a low-growing, spineless plant with a globular shape and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically 5-7 cm in diameter and have a star-shaped pattern, giving it its common name. The cactus is popular among succulent enthusiasts for its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
