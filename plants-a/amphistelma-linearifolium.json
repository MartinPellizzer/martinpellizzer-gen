    "intro": "Amphistelma linearifolium, commonly known as the slender-leaved starwort, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant features finely divided, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbrella-like clusters, which attract various pollinators. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
