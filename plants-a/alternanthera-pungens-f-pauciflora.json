    "intro": "Alternanthera pungens f. pauciflora, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a compact, branching annual plant native to South America. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a striking pink to red color, which contrast beautifully with its tiny white flowers. The plant is noted for its ornamental value, often grown in gardens for its vibrant foliage. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil. Due to its low-flower count, it is sometimes used in horticultural studies for its unique floral characteristics."
