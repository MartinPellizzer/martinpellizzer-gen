    "intro": "Aconitum napellus subsp. vulgare, commonly known as the European aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafed stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, typically arranged in dense clusters at the top of the stem. Its roots and rhizomes contain potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling. This subspecies is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows.",
