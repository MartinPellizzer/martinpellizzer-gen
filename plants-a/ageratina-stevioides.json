    "intro": "Ageratina stevioides, commonly known as the silverleaf ageratum, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ageratina stevioides is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic appeal and drought tolerance."
