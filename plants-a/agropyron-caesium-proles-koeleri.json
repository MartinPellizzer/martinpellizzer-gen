    "intro": "Agropyron caesium proles koeleri, commonly known as the Koeler's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its hardiness and nutritional value, it is sometimes used in forage and as a soil stabilizer in restoration projects."
