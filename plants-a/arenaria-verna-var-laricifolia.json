    "intro": "Arenaria verna var. laricifolia, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully develop. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with hairy stems and leaves that are typically linear to lanceolate in shape. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variety is distinguished by its association with coniferous forests, giving it its specific epithet \"laricifolia,\" meaning \"larch-leaf.\""
