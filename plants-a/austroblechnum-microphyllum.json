    "intro": "Austroblechnum microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved southern holly fern, is a compact evergreen fern native to southeastern Australia. It features dense, dark green, leathery fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a brown indusium. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Its slow growth and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded borders."
