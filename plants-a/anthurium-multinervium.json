    "intro": "Anthurium multinervium, commonly known as the veiny anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, spadix-like flowers surrounded by a colorful spathe, typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires indirect light for optimal growth. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
