    "intro": "Amaioua fagifolia, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and elliptical, glossy green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round, yellowish fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
