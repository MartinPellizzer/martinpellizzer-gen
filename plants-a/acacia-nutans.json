    "intro": "Acacia nutans, commonly known as the weeping acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its drooping, feathery foliage that gives it a distinctive, cascading appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in summer, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets. Acacia nutans is adapted to arid environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its unique visual appeal.",

This plant thrives in dry and semi-arid environments. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is often used for its timber and medicinal properties. Its distribution is largely restricted to the western and central regions of Senegal.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia nutans was mainly introduced to stabilize soils and provide forage in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly found in areas with low rainfall and poor soil quality. The plant has been introduced to several countries in Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Australia. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in harsh conditions make it a popular choice for land rehabilitation. However, it can become invasive in some environments if not managed properly."
