The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is well adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
