    "intro": "Aconitum ferox var. atrox, commonly known as the deadly larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are compound, with deeply cut lobes, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. However, all parts of the plant are highly toxic due to the presence of potent alkaloids, making it a dangerous species to handle.",
