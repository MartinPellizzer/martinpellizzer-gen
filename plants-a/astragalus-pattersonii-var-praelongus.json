    "intro": "Astragalus pattersonii var. praelongus, commonly known as the long-stalked milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellow flowers. The plant has compound leaves with numerous leaflets and produces pods that contain lens-shaped seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, often in areas with well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
