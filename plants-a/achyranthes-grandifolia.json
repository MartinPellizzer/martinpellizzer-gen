It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense colonies, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. Achyranthes grandifolia is often found in wetlands, fields, and along stream banks.",
