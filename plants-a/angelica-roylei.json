    "intro": "Angelica roylei, commonly known as the Kashmir angelica, is a tall biennial or perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It features large, compound leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length, with a distinctive silvery-white underside. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbrella-like inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Angelica roylei thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat."
