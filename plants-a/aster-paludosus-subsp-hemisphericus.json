    "intro": "Aster paludosus subsp. hemisphericus, commonly known as the Hemispheric Aster, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, hemispherical-shaped flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often in marshes or along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its stems are hairy and upright. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its aesthetic appeal in wetland restoration projects."
