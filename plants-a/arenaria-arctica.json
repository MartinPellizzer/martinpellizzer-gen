    "intro": "Arenaria arctica, commonly known as arctic sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant is well adapted to cold climates and nutrient-poor soils, with a shallow root system that helps it survive in harsh environments. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in freezing conditions. Arenaria arctica plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small Arctic fauna."
