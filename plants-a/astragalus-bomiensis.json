    "intro": "Astragalus bomiensis, commonly known as the Bomien milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. It has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Astragalus bomiensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
