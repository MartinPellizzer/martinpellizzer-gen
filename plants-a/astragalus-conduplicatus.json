    "intro": "Astragalus conduplicatus, commonly known as the double-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with two pairs of leaflets, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Astragalus conduplicatus is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
