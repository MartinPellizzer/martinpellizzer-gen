    "intro": "Alexis, commonly known as the African violet, is a popular ornamental plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the genus Saintpaulia and is characterized by its vibrant, velvety flowers that come in a wide range of colors. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its compact growth habit makes it ideal for indoor cultivation, and it is often grown in pots or as part of a hanging basket display. The leaves are dark green and glossy, adding to its ornamental appeal."
