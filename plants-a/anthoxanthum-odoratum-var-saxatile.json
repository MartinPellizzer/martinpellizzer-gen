    "intro": "Anthoxanthum odoratum var. saxatile, commonly known as the sweet vernal grass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and bright yellow-green inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas. The plant is notable for its aromatic scent, which becomes more pronounced when the flowers mature. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. This variety is adapted to harsh environments and is an important component of ecological restoration projects."
