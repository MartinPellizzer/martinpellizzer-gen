    "intro": "Allium attenuifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved garlic. It is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan and Mongolia. The plant features a bulbous stem with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale purple flowers in umbel-like clusters. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. The plant is closely related to other allium species, such as garlic and leeks, and is valued for its culinary and medicinal uses."
