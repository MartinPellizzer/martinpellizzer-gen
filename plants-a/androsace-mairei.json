    "intro": "Androsace mairei, commonly known as the Maire's rock rose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are succulent, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve moisture in its alpine habitat. Androsace mairei is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
