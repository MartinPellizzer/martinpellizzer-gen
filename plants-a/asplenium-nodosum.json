    "intro": "Asplenium nodosum, commonly known as the shuttlecock fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, clustered fronds that resemble a shuttlecock, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are compound, with numerous small, toothed pinnae that are often curled or twisted. Asplenium nodosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
