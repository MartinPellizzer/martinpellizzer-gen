It is native to the mountainous regions of North America, particularly in the western United States and southern Canada. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually lance-shaped and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, and it produces a milky latex when the stems or leaves are broken. Alloplectus sprucei typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands or alpine meadows."
