    "intro": "Alnus tinctoria, commonly known as the dyer's alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 pairs of ovate to lanceolate leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in catkins, which are pollinated by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, and it often grows in moist, acidic soils. Alnus tinctoria is notable for its historical use in dyeing fabrics due to the presence of certain compounds in its leaves."
