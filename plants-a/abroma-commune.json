    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abroma commune is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Cameroon. It is commonly found in moist lowland forests and along riverbanks. The plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its distribution is also reported in parts of Southeast Asia and the Caribbean.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abroma commune was mainly introduced to Hawaii. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation in certain areas. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in coastal and lowland habitats. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems."
