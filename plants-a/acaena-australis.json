    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena australis is primarily native to New Zealand. It is commonly found in the southern regions of the country, including the South Island and parts of the North Island. This plant thrives in a variety of habitats, such as grasslands, shrublands, and coastal areas. It is well adapted to the temperate climate and can tolerate both dry and moist conditions. Acaena australis plays an important role in the local ecosystem, providing food and habitat for various native wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena australis was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century. The plant was initially planted for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in many areas. Its spread has led to concerns about its impact on local ecosystems and biodiversity."
