    "intro": "Asclepias purpurascens, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and produces a milky sap that is toxic to some animals. This species plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae."
