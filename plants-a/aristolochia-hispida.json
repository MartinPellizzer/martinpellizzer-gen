    "intro": "Aristolochia hispida, commonly known as the rough-petaled Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are often greenish or brownish in color, with a strongly aromatic scent. The plant has rough, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically lobed. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and the plant produces small, berry-like fruits that contain the seeds. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
