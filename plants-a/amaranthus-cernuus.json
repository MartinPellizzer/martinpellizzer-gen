    "intro": "Amaranthus cernuus, commonly known as redstem amaranth, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It features branched stems that often lie prostrate or spread along the ground, with small, clustered leaves. The plant produces numerous tiny, greenish to reddish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by triangular, three-angled seed capsules. Its foliage is typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Amaranthus cernuus is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
