    "intro": "Aegiphila costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican aegiphila, is a shrub native to Central America, particularly found in Costa Rica and parts of Panama. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a relatively rare and ecologically significant species."
