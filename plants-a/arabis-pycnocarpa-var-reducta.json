    "intro": "Arabis pycnocarpa var. reducta, commonly known as the compact cabbage mustard, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly woolly texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in tight clusters, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its compact form and ornamental foliage make it a desirable addition to gardens with limited space."
