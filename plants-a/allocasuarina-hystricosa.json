    "intro": "Allocasuarina hystricosa, commonly known as the smooth casuarina, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, needle-like leaves that are arranged in cylindrical clusters, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. Allocasuarina hystricosa is adapted to salty and wind-prone environments, making it an important component of coastal vegetation."
