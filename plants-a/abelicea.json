    "intro": "Abelicea, commonly known as the \"devil's flower,\" is a genus of flowering plants native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and shrub-like growth habit. The plants typically have opposite leaves and produce small, clustered inflorescences. Abelicea species are often found in rocky or coastal areas, adapting to the harsh conditions of their native habitat. Due to their limited distribution and unique features, they are of interest to botanists and conservationists."
