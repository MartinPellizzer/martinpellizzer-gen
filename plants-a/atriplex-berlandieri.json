    "intro": "Atriplex berlandieri, commonly known as desert saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, salt-tolerant leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring. Its robust root system allows it to thrive in poor, saline soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Atriplex berlandieri plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
