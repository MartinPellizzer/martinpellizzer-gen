    "intro": "Alsophila marattioides, commonly known as the Marattioid tree fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Dicksoniaceae and is closely related to other tree ferns such as Cyathea. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, providing structural support and enabling it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The fronds are typically bioluminescent in the dark, a feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
