It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, velvety foliage and showy flowers. The plant typically has a short, stocky stem with rosettes of waxy, heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers come in a variety of colors, including purple, pink, white, and blue, and are borne on long, slender stalks. Afraegle thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
