    "intro": "Agrostis turrialbae, commonly known as the Turrialba grass, is a species of grass native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on forest floors. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in the understory. Its small, spikelet-based inflorescences contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, typical of many grass species. Agrostis turrialbae plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
