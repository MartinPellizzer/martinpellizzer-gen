    "intro": "Arthratherum lanuginosum, commonly known as the downy hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and compact, tufted growth habit. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. Arthratherum lanuginosum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
