    "intro": "Alyssum arduinoi, commonly known as the desert alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Alyssum arduinoi is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
