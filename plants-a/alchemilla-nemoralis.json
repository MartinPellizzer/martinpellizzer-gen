    "intro": "Alchemilla nemoralis, commonly known as lesser lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are followed by distinctive, persistent seed heads. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Alchemilla nemoralis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in challenging soil conditions."
