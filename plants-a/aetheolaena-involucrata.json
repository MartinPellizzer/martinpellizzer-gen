    "intro": "Aetheolaena involucrata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Convolvulaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats, such as roadsides and abandoned fields, due to its adaptability. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soils make it both a common weed and a valuable ornamental plant. Aetheolaena involucrata is also known for its fragrant blooms that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
