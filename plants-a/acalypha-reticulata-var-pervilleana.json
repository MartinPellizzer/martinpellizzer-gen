    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha reticulata var. pervilleana is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This variant is typically associated with lowland forests and is sometimes seen in disturbed or secondary vegetation. It thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil, making it a common understory plant in many parts of its native range. The plant is known for its striking foliage and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha reticulata var. pervilleana was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its striking foliage and unique growth habit. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its aesthetic value in gardens and as a decorative plant. The plant's ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to partial shade make it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor settings. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas where it can outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns about ecological impacts in regions where it is not native."
