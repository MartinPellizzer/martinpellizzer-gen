    "intro": "Aristida longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered threeawn, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, and it is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening due to its delicate appearance and drought tolerance. The species is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and birds."
