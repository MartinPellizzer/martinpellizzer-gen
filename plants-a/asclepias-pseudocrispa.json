    "intro": "Asclepias pseudocrispa, commonly known as the Florida milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers with intricate, milky sap-filled structures called caruncles. It is a vital host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing nourishment for both larvae and adult butterflies. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in sandy or disturbed soils, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
