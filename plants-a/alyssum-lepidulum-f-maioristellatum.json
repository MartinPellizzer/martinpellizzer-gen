    "intro": "Alyssum lepidulum f. maioristellatum, commonly known as the greater clustered alyssum, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and profuse clusters of small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant produces small, rounded leaves that are densely packed, giving it a dense, mat-like appearance. Native to the western United States, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
