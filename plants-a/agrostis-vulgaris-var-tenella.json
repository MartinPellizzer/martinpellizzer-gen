    "intro": "Agrostis vulgaris var. tenella, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths on the ground, often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny grains. It is well adapted to wet conditions and can thrive in areas with poor drainage. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
