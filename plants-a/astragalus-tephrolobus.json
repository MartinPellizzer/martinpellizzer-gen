    "intro": "Astragalus tephrolobus, commonly known as the ash-gray milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, leathery pods that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments. Astragalus tephrolobus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations."
