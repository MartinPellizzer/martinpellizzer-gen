    "intro": "Agrostis canina var. aenea, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage due to the presence of dense, silky hairs on its leaves. This variant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for garden use. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flower spikes in late summer, adding subtle visual interest to its habitat."
