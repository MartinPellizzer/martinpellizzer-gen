    "intro": "Adiantum dentatum, commonly known as the notched maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing structures called sori. Adiantum dentatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.",
