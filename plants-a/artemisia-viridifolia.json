    "intro": "Artemisia viridifolia, commonly known as greenleaf wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant contains essential oils and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. Artemisia viridifolia is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature."
