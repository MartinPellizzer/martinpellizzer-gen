    "intro": "Asplenium montanum, commonly known as the mountain spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices, stream banks, and forest floors. The plant has a distinctive appearance with lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of moss. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of ferns. Asplenium montanum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
