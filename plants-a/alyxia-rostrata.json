    "intro": "Alyxia rostrata, commonly known as the coral vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, coral-pink flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its vibrant floral display. Alyxia rostrata is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
