    "intro": "Armeria alpina f. pumila, commonly known as the alpine thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
