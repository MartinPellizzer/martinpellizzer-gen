    "intro": "Allocarya corrugata, commonly known as the roughleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that exhibits a distinctive, rugged texture on its upper surface. It typically grows on tree trunks and branches in cool, moist forest environments. The thallus is composed of a complex intergrowth of algae and fungi, with the fungal component providing structural support. Its color ranges from pale yellowish-green to olive-brown, depending on the season and environmental conditions. Allocarya corrugata plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator of air quality in its habitat."
