It is characterized by its fine, delicate foliage and slender, arching stems that form a low, spreading clump. The plant produces small, feathery inflorescences that are typically green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate appearance and ability to withstand drought conditions."
