    "intro": "Anthemis pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf pygmy tansy, is a small, flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with finely divided, fern-like leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its delicate size and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens as a hardy, low-maintenance plant."
