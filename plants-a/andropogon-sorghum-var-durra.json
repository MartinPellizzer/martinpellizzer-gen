    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum var. durra, commonly known as durra, is a wild species of sorghum native to Africa. It is a tall, robust grass with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in hot, dry climates with poor soil conditions. Durra is often used for forage, erosion control, and in traditional medicine. Its fibrous stalks and seeds have been utilized by indigenous communities for centuries."
