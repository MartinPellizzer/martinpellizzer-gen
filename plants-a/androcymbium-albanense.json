    "intro": "Androcymbium albanense, commonly known as the Albanian orchid, is a rare and endemic flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Albania. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale yellow to greenish-white petals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this unique botanical gem from threats such as habitat loss and over-collection."
