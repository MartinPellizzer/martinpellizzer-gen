    "intro": "Alnus crispa subsp. sinuata, commonly known as the Sinuate alder, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or wetlands. The species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration projects."
