    "intro": "Agropyron pectiniforme var. pseudobulbosum, commonly known as the pseudobulbous wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and produces dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant forms compact pseudobulbs, which are swollen stems that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in harsh environments. It typically blooms with small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale green to yellowish flowers. This variety is valued for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in restoration ecology and forage production."
