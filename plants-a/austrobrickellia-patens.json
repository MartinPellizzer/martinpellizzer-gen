    "intro": "Austrobrickellia patens, commonly known as the coastal brickellia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in areas subject to salt spray. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Austrobrickellia patens plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for native insects and birds."
