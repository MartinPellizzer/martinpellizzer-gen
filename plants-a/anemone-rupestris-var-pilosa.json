    "intro": "Anemone rupestris var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy rock anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces showy, pink to white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to anchor firmly in crevices and poor soils. This variety is well adapted to full sun and is often found in rocky outcrops and gravelly slopes."
