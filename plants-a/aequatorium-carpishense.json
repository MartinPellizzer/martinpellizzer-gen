    "intro": "Aequatorium carpishense, commonly known as the Carpish marsh orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the wetlands of the Carpish Basin. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pale pink and white. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists studying wetland ecosystems."
