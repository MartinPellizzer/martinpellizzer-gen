    "intro": "Amsinckia congesta, commonly known as the clustered fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its hairy stems and leaves help it retain moisture in arid environments. Amsinckia congesta is often found in open grasslands and is adapted to full sun exposure."
