    "intro": "Alchemilla sibbaldiifolia var. tonduzii, commonly known as the Sibbald's lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a dense rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry, sunny locations."
