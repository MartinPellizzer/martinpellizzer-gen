It is characterized by its small, rounded form and delicate, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its compact size and seasonal color changes make it a valuable addition to gardens and natural habitats.",
