    "intro": "Agropyron albicans, commonly known as the white needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the colder regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, light green blades and dense, fibrous root system that helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as tundra, alpine meadows, and dry grasslands. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, forming spikelets that are clustered along the stem. Agropyron albicans plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native environments."
