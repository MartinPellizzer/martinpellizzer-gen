    "intro": "Aspidium trifoliatum var. heracleifolium, commonly known as the Heracleifolium spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, clustered growth habit and consists of fertile and sterile fronds. The fronds are typically lanceolate to ovate in shape, with a serrated or toothed margin. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds. This variety is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors."
