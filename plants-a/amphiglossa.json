    "intro": "Amphiglossa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Amphiglossa is native to the Americas and is commonly found in wetlands and disturbed areas. It is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
