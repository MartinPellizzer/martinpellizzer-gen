It consists of several species, primarily native to South America, particularly Brazil. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers. The leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a leathery texture. Abietia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their evergreen foliage and fragrant blooms."
