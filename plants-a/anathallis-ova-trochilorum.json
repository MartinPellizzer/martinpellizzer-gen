    "intro": "Anathallis ova-trochilorum, commonly known as the hummingbird orchid, is a rare and specialized epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which features a modified leaf-like structure called a \"spathe\" that encloses the actual flower. The plant produces small, delicate flowers with a distinctive coloration that attracts specific pollinators, primarily hummingbirds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees in the understory of dense tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
