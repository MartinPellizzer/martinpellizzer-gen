    "intro": "Athyrium cordatum, commonly known as the heartleaf fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It features delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive heart-shaped outline in the fertile fronds. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium cordatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
