It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the summer months. It grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its resilience and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
