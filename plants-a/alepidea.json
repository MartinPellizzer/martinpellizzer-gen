    "intro": "Alepidea, commonly known as the African daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to southern Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid regions. The plants are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to yellow and orange. Alepidea species typically have linear or strap-shaped leaves and produce small, dry fruits called achenes. These plants are often used in gardens for their ornamental value and drought tolerance."
