It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered closely together. The plant typically grows on rocks, trees, or soil in temperate regions. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture. Asplenium attenuatum plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms."
