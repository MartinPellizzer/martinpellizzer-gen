    "intro": "Alsophila aspera var. spinosa, commonly known as the spinous tree fern, is a variant of the common tree fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its robust, upright trunk and large, feathery fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is often valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture and its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
