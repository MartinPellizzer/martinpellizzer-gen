    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera f. humilis, commonly known as silvergrass or mat grass, is a low-growing, perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features fine, silver-gray blades and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often used in ornamental landscaping. The plant spreads via stolons, forming dense, mat-like growth that helps suppress weeds and prevent soil erosion. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Its adaptability makes it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and sustainable gardening practices."
