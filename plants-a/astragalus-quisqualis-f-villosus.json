    "intro": "Astragalus quisqualis f. villosus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
