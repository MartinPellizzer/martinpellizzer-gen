    "intro": "Anthurium horridum, commonly known as the spiny anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and deep green coloration. The plant produces vibrant red spathes that enclose its small, yellowish spadices, which are the actual flowering structures. Anthurium horridum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental purposes."
