    "intro": "Athrixia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly sandwort, is a small, mat-forming succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features dense, compact growth with fleshy, gray-green leaves covered in a fine, woolly coating. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Athrixia tomentosa is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
