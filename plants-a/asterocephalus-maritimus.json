    "intro": "Asterocephalus maritimus, commonly known as the coastal aster, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright, herbaceous growth habit and produces clusters of small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to saline and windy coastal environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and grayish-green, providing a striking contrast to the bright yellow blooms. Asterocephalus maritimus plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for various small coastal organisms."
