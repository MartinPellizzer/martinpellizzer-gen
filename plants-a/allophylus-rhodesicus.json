    "intro": "Allophylus rhodesicus, commonly known as the Rhodes holly, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the late summer to early autumn. These flowers give way to small, red berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. Allophylus rhodesicus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
