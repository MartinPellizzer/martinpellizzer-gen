    "intro": "Atriplex limbata, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is often found growing on saline soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high salinity. Atriplex limbata plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
