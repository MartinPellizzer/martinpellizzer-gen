    "intro": "Acantholimon linczevskianum, commonly known as the Linczevsky's thornscale, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It is known for its ability to store water in its leaves, which helps it survive in harsh, dry conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",

It is commonly found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the Pamir and Tien Shan ranges. This plant thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing on slopes and in open meadows. It is well adapted to the cold and arid conditions typical of its native habitat. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon linczevskianum was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its attractive blue-gray foliage and showy flowers. It has been cultivated in gardens and botanical collections across southern Europe, particularly in countries like Spain, Italy, and Greece. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or arid landscapes. However, it has shown potential to naturalize in some areas, raising concerns about its impact on local ecosystems. Its introduction has been documented in several horticultural databases and botanical gardens in the region."
