    "intro": "Astrantia carinthiaca, commonly known as Carpathian aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe. It features showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has a clump-forming growth habit with basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in soft, fuzzy hairs. Its flowers are arranged in flat-topped clusters, and the plant produces small, dry fruits called achenes. Astrantia carinthiaca is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
