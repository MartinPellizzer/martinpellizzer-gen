    "intro": "Astragalus americanus f. pallescens, commonly known as the pale milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and sandy soils. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria. The pale-colored flowers and foliage give it its distinguishing appearance."
