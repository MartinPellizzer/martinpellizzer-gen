    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelmoschus vanoverberghii is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Sudan, Ethiopia, and Kenya. It is also found in parts of southern Arabia and the island of Socotra. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It is commonly associated with dry savannas and shrublands. Its native range reflects its adaptation to harsh climatic conditions typical of the African continent.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus vanoverberghii was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in Brazil, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive flowers. It was also introduced to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia for its ornamental value and potential medicinal uses. The plant has been reported in several countries, including Argentina, Colombia, and Peru, where it has established populations in disturbed habitats. Despite its introduction, it is not considered invasive in most regions, though it has the potential to spread in suitable environments. Its distribution is primarily limited to areas with warm climates and well-drained soils."
