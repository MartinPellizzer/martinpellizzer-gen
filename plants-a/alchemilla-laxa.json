    "intro": "Alchemilla laxa, commonly known as the slender lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its spreading, hairy stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. The plant produces basal leaves that are pinnately divided, giving it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla laxa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to stabilize soil in wet conditions."
