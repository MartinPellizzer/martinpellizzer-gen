    "intro": "Agave parryi f. integrifolia, commonly known as the Parry's agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features rosettes of thick, bluish-gray leaves that are typically spiny along the edges. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with white to pale yellow flowers. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its slow growth and striking appearance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
