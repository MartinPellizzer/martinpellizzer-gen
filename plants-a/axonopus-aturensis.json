    "intro": "Axonopus aturensis, commonly known as the golden carpet grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features fine, bright green leaves that form a dense, mat-like growth pattern on the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Axonopus aturensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in landscaping and restoration projects."
