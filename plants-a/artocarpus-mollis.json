    "intro": "Artocarpus mollis, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and large, palmate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The tree produces clusters of small, green, fleshy fruits that turn yellow when mature. These fruits are edible, with a sweet and tangy flavor, and are often consumed fresh or used in culinary applications. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its shade-providing canopy."
