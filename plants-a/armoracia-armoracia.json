    "intro": "Armoracia armoracia, commonly known as horseradish, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other mustard plants. The plant is characterized by its thick, dark green, arrow-shaped leaves and small white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its rhizome, or underground stem, is the primary part used for its pungent, spicy flavor. Horseradish is often cultivated for culinary use and has a long history in traditional medicine."
