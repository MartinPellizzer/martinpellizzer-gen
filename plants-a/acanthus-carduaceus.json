    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthus carduaceus is primarily native to the East Himalaya. It is found in regions spanning across eastern Nepal, Bhutan, and northern India. This plant typically grows in mountainous areas with rocky soils at higher elevations. It is often associated with alpine and subalpine habitats. Its native distribution is limited to these specific geographic regions within the East Himalayan range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus carduaceus was mainly introduced to new environments through human activity, such as accidental transport via contaminated soil or seeds. It is commonly found in disturbed areas like roadsides, fields, and waste sites where it can thrive in poor soil conditions. This plant is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native flora and ecosystems. Efforts are being made to monitor and control its spread to prevent further ecological disruption."
