    "intro": "Astrochlaena magisii, commonly known as the golden star lily, is a rare and striking member of the Araceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its vibrant yellow spathe and a cluster of small, white spathes that resemble stars. Its foliage consists of broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are often variegated with green and white patterns. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is considered a valuable species in horticulture."
