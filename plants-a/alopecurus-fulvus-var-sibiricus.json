    "intro": "Alopecurus fulvus var. sibiricus, commonly known as Siberian mouse-ear, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Eurasia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. The plant features slender, creeping stems with small, hairless leaves that are often covered in a fine, pale pubescence. Its flowers are pale blue to purple, clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and bloom from late summer to early autumn. This variety is closely related to other species in the Poaceae family and is often used in ecological restoration due to its adaptability and soil-stabilizing properties."
