    "intro": "Acacia ramulosa var. ramulosa, commonly known as the slender wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and sandy environments. Its ecological importance includes providing nectar for native pollinators and habitat for small fauna.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia ramulosa var. ramulosa is primarily native to New South Wales, Northern Territory, Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia. This shrub is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions across these states. It thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the Australian interior. Its distribution reflects its ability to survive in dry, nutrient-poor environments.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia ramulosa var. ramulosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature. The species has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in coastal and lowland areas. It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides throughout the country. However, its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to invade native ecosystems."
