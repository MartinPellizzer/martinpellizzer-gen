It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in crevices. Asplenium eggersii is a relatively rare species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
