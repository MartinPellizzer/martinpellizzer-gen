    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia cunninghamii var. longispicata is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of northern Australia, including the Northern Territory, Western Australia, and Queensland. This variety is commonly found in coastal areas, sandplain woodlands, and dry rainforests. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with sandy or lateritic soils. The plant is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia cunninghamii var. longispicata was mainly introduced to South Australia and Western Australia. It is commonly found in sandy soils along coastal areas and in dune environments. This variety is known for its distinctive long, slender spines and its ability to thrive in arid conditions. It is often used in rehabilitation projects due to its hardy nature and windbreak capabilities. However, it can become invasive in certain areas if not managed properly."
