    "intro": "Andropogon saccharoides var. hassleri, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray leaf surfaces and tufted inflorescences, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and prairies, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and have a rough texture, while its flowering stalks are often branched and produce small, spikelet-like flowers. Silver bluestem is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in stabilizing soil in native landscapes."
