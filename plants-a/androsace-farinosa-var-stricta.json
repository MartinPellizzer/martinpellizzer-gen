    "intro": "Androsace farinosa var. stricta, commonly known as the cushion sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It features a dense rosette of hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Its compact growth habit and ability to withstand cold temperatures make it a hardy addition to rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
