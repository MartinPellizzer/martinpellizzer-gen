    "intro": "Agrostis scotantha, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides, meadows, and fields. The plant has fine, slender leaves that are often tufted at the base, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can help prevent soil erosion. Agrostis scotantha is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
