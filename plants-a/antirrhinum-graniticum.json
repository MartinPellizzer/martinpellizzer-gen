    "intro": "Antirrhinum graniticum, commonly known as the granitic snapdragon, is a flowering plant native to the rocky habitats of southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of bright red or orange tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained, calcareous soils and thrives in full sun. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by bees and other insects, with a unique structure that facilitates nectar access. Antirrhinum graniticum is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its specialized ecosystem."
