    "intro": "Aspidium filix-mas var. lacerum, commonly known as the broken fern, is a variant of the male fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its fronds that are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments, giving it a distinctive, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. The varietal name \"lacerum\" refers to the fronds' tendency to break easily, contributing to its common name."
