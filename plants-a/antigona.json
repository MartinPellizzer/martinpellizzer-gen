These plants are characterized by their large, showy flowers that typically bloom in the early morning. Antigona species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Asia and Africa. They are often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. The plant's unique morphology and cultural significance make it an important species in both ecological and symbolic contexts."
