    "intro": "Amorphophallus antsingyensis, commonly known as the Madagascar giant arrowroot, is a member of the Araceae family. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its large,\u621f\u5f62 (spear-shaped) leaves and an underground tuberous stem. The plant produces a spadix inflorescence, which is typical of the Araceae family, and it blooms with a distinctive, often foul-smelling flower. The tuber is edible and has been traditionally used as a food source by local communities. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
