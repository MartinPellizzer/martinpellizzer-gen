    "intro": "Aconitum delphiniifolium var. ramosum, commonly known as the Delphinium-leaf Aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking blue to purple flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late summer. The plant has palmately compound leaves with a deep green color and a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.",
