    "intro": "Arenaria loscosii, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss, and it produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early summer. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil on steep slopes. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens."
