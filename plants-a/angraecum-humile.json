It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue with a yellow or orange lip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on trees without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its unique floral structure is adapted for pollination by specific nocturnal moths. Angraecum humile is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts due to its rarity and beauty."
