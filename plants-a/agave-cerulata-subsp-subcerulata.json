It is characterized by its striking blue-gray foliage, which is covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear small, greenish-white flowers. It is a perennial species that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in tequila production, it is widely cultivated in gardens and agricultural settings."
