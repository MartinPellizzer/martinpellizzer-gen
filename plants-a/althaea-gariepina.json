    "intro": "Althaea gariepina, commonly known as the Gariep marshmallow, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native arid environments. Althaea gariepina is valued for its mucilaginous properties, which have been used in traditional medicine for their soothing effects."
