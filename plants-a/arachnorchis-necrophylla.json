    "intro": "Arachnorchis necrophylla, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive terrestrial orchid native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that resemble spider-like structures, hence its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests or under dense vegetation. It has a unique mycorrhizal relationship with fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and is often difficult to find in the wild."
