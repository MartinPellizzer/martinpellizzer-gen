    "intro": "Asparagus altilis subsp. polyphyllus, commonly known as the giant asparagus or the African asparagus, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its robust, fibrous roots and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid conditions. The plant produces long, cylindrical stems that can grow up to several meters in height, often branching into multiple shoots. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while the spiny, edible spears are harvested for culinary use. This subspecies is valued not only for its nutritional content but also for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses."
