    "intro": "Atriplex prostrata subsp. prostrata, commonly known as sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are often subtended by bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in deserts, dunes, and rocky habitats. Its ability to tolerate extreme environmental conditions makes it an important component of desert ecosystems."
