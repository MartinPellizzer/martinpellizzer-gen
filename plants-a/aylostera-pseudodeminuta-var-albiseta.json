    "intro": "Aylostera pseudodeminuta var. albiseta, commonly known as the white-flowered aylostera, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are elongated and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers produce a distinctive white to pale yellow coloration. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
