    "intro": "Atelophragma alpinum, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps protect it from harsh environmental conditions. Atelophragma alpinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
