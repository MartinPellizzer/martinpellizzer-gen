    "intro": "Astragalus caprinus subsp. caprinus, commonly known as the mountain milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to reddish-purple flowers in clusters. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
