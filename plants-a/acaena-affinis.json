    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena affinis is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found throughout the country, particularly in the South Island. This plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including forests, shrublands, and coastal areas. It is commonly associated with the eastern and western regions of New Zealand. Acaena affinis is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for native birds and insects.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena affinis was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation in various habitats. The plant thrives in a range of soil types and can tolerate both full sun and partial shade. Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to disrupt local ecosystems."
