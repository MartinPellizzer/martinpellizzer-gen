    "intro": "Alopecurus pratensis var. geniculatus, commonly known as the bent grass or meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, pastures, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats, and its leaves are narrow with a rough texture. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a forage crop."
