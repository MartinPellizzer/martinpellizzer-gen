    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon pseudocleistogamum f. bathiei is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa. It is found in the Western Cape Province, where it thrives in sandy or rocky coastal habitats. This plant is adapted to the warm, dry climate typical of the region's Mediterranean climate. It is often seen growing in dunes or along the edges of coastal forests. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats that provide the right balance of sunlight, moisture, and soil conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon pseudocleistogamum f. bathiei was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. It thrives in environments with ample sunlight and moderate to high rainfall. This plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, waste areas, and along riverbanks. Its introduction has been associated with ornamental horticulture and ecological restoration projects. Due to its adaptability, it has spread to various regions beyond its native range."
