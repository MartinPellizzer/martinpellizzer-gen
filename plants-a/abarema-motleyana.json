    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abarema motleyana is primarily native to Brazil. It is found in the northeastern region of the country, specifically in the states of Pernambuco, Piau\u00ed, and Cear\u00e1. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in open woodlands and savannas. It is adapted to well-drained soils and is commonly found in areas with seasonal rainfall. Its native range is limited to these specific regions within Brazil.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema motleyana was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and agricultural fields. The plant is often spread through human activity, including the transport of contaminated soil or seeds. It has adapted well to a variety of environmental conditions, making it a successful invasive species in many regions. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands contribute to its competitive advantage over native vegetation."
