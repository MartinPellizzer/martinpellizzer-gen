    "intro": "Aegiphila arborescens var. longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly found in Puerto Rico and the Lesser Antilles. It is a shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded areas within tropical forests. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which bloom during the dry season. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a rough texture with a strong, aromatic scent. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations in its native habitat."
