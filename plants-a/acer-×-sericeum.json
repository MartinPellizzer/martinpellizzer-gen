    "intro": "Acer \u00d7 sericeum, commonly known as the silver maple, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely toothed, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, winged samaras that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and open woodlands.",
