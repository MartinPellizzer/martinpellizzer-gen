    "intro": "Astragalus atwoodii, commonly known as Atwood's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Its small, oval leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus atwoodii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
