    "intro": "Acontias diversifolius, commonly known as the variable-leaf fern, is a species of fern characterized by its diverse leaf morphology. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a variety of shapes and sizes depending on environmental conditions. This plant exhibits a high degree of morphological variation, which contributes to its adaptability. Its reproductive structures include sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species.",
