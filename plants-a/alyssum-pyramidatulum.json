    "intro": "Alyssum pyramidatulum, commonly known as the dwarf winter alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has gray-green, hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its botanical name reflects its pyramid-shaped flower clusters and its tendency to grow in a pyramidal form."
