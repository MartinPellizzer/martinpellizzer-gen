    "intro": "Agrostis ravennae, commonly known as Raven's grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense, compact clumps with slender, hairless stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that becomes more prominent in the summer months. Agrostis ravennae is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils."
