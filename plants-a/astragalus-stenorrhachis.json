    "intro": "Astragalus stenorrhachis, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or pink. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is adapted to grow in dry, rocky environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Astragalus stenorrhachis is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in arid ecosystems."
