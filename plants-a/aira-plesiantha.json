It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in rocky, alpine environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, white to pale blue flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand cold and strong winds. Aira plesiantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems of mountainous regions."
