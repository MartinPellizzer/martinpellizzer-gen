    "intro": "Adenocarpus intermedius, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Fabaceae. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that are typically arranged in racemes, and it is known for its milky sap, which is a distinguishing feature. Adenocarpus intermedius thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores.",
