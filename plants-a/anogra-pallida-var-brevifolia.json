    "intro": "Anogra pallida var. brevifolia, commonly known as the pale anogra, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of South America. It features slender, upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale yellow to cream in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland borders. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
