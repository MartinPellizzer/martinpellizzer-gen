    "intro": "Aeschynanthus truncatus, commonly known as the wax plant, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically bright red or orange. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy texture, contributing to its common name. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
