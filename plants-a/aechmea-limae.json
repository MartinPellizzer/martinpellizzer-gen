    "intro": "Aechmea limae, commonly known as the Limes Aechmea, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the cloud forests of Central and South America, particularly in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures. The plant features a rosette of sword-shaped, evergreen leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater. Its inflorescence consists of vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from red to orange, often blooming in late winter or early spring. Aechmea limae is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
