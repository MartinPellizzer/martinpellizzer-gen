It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of rounded, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are clustered in branched cymes. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. Alchemilla integribasis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
