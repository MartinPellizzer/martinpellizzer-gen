    "intro": "Astragalus varius, commonly known as the variable milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils. Its roots are fibrous and can form a dense network, helping to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Astragalus varius is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in grassland ecosystems."
