    "intro": "Acer argutum f. latialatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which are typically larger and more broadly shaped compared to the species. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various garden settings.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer argutum f. latialatum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China, specifically in provinces such as Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou. This variety thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is commonly found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. It is often associated with mixed deciduous and coniferous forests, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of the region. The plant is known for its distinctive leaves, which are broader and more elongated compared to the typical form of *Acer argutum*. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer argutum f. latialatum was mainly introduced to enhance ornamental value in gardens and landscapes due to its unique foliage characteristics. This form is known for its striking, palmately lobed leaves that display a vibrant green color throughout the growing season. It is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil types. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is relatively easy to maintain. Its introduction has expanded the diversity of maple species available for horticultural use."
