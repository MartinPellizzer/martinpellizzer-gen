    "intro": "Aristeguietia glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky arrowroot, is a perennial herb native to the humid lowland forests of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its fibrous root system and slender, hairy stems. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, elliptical berries. Its leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and have a rough, sticky texture due to the presence of glandular hairs. Aristeguietia glutinosa is often found in shaded, moist environments and is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
