    "intro": "Apocynum cannabinum var. incanum, commonly known as white cocklebine, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy white to pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woods or along stream banks. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and have a rough texture, while the fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds. This variant is distinguished by its more densely hairy stems and smaller, more clustered flowers compared to the typical form."
