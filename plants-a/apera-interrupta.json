    "intro": "Apera interrupta, commonly known as common brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a rough texture and a prominent midrib. Apera interrupta is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
