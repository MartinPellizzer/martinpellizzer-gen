    "intro": "Aristida adscensionis var. abortiva, commonly known as the abortive lovegrass, is a perennial grass species native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. The variety 'abortiva' is distinguished by its reduced flowering structures, which may contribute to its unique ecological role."
