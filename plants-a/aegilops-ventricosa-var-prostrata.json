    "intro": "Aegilops ventricosa var. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate spikegrass, is a low-growing annual grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It features prostrate or decumbent stems that lie close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in clusters, with lemmas that are usually hairy and narrow. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are followed by spikelets that mature into dry, indehiscent fruits. This variety is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
