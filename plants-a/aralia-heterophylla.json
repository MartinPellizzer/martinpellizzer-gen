    "intro": "Aralia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable aralia, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its alternate, compound leaves that vary in shape and size along the stem, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbrella-like clusters, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in moist, wooded areas. The botanical features of Aralia heterophylla make it a distinctive and valuable addition to native plant gardens."
