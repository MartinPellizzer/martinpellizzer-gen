    "intro": "Avicennia alba var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf mangrove, is a salt-tolerant shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in intertidal zones, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and preventing erosion. The plant has specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which allow it to absorb oxygen from the waterlogged soil. Its leaves are broad and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), helping to reduce water loss in saline environments. This species is an important component of mangrove ecosystems, providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
