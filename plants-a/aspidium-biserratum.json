    "intro": "Aspidium biserratum, commonly known as the serrated water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the substrate. Aspidium biserratum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
