    "intro": "Aconitum aggregatifolium, commonly known as the clustered leaf aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant features large, palmately compound leaves with a hairy texture, and its flowers are blue to purple in color, arranged in a raceme. Aconitum aggregatifolium contains potent alkaloids, making it toxic and requiring careful handling. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.",
