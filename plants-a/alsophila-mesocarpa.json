    "intro": "Alsophila mesocarpa, commonly known as the broad-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, frond-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a robust, unbranched trunk that is covered in a fibrous, spongy material. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores, typical of ferns. Alsophila mesocarpa thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
