    "intro": "Anabasis articulata subsp. oropediorum, commonly known as the coastal arrowweed, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline and arid environments. It typically grows in coastal dunes and salt marshes, where it tolerates high salt concentrations and poor soil conditions. The plant has slender, branching stems with small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. Its flowers are yellowish-green and appear in clusters, contributing to its role in stabilizing sandy soils. This subspecies is valued for its ecological resilience and is often used in coastal restoration projects."
