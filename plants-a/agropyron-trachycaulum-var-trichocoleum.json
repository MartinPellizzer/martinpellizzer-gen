    "intro": "Agropyron trachycaulum var. trichocoleum, commonly known as the rough bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its coarse, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which makes it well-suited for dry, rocky soils. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil. Its botanical features make it an important component of native grassland ecosystems."
