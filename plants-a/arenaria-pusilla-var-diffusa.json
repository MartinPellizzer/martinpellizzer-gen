    "intro": "Arenaria pusilla var. diffusa, commonly known as the mossy sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery bloom. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in early summer. It is native to arctic and alpine regions and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its compact size and ability to colonize disturbed areas, it is considered an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
