    "intro": "Acer insigne var. vanvolxemii, commonly known as the Vanvolxemii maple, is a rare and ornamental variant of the insigne maple. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China, where it thrives in cool, moist climates. The plant is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that display a vibrant green during the growing season. In autumn, the foliage turns brilliant shades of red and orange, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its slow growth rate and compact size make it suitable for small gardens and container cultivation.",
