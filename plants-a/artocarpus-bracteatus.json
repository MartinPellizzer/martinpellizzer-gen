    "intro": "Artocarpus bracteatus, commonly known as the bracteate breadfruit, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Moraceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces a fruit that is similar in appearance to breadfruit but is typically smaller and has a rougher texture. The fruit contains a starchy pulp that can be cooked and eaten, though it is less commonly consumed than other breadfruit species. It is also valued for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique fruit structure."
