    "intro": "Angraecum pertusum, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its tall, branched stem and large, showy flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces a single spike with several flowers, each having a distinctive, spurred lip. Its flowers are pollinated by the hawkmoth, which is attracted to the nectar and the specific shape of the spur. Angraecum pertusum is a rare and endangered species, often found in specific microhabitats within its native range."
