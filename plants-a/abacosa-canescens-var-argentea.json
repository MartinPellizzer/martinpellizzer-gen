    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abacosa canescens var. argentea is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Bahamas. This plant is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils, often growing in dune environments. It thrives in sunny, well-drained conditions and is adapted to salt spray from the sea. The variety argentea is distinguished by its silvery-white undersides on the leaves. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abacosa canescens var. argentea was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in arid or semi-arid regions. It is commonly found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along creek banks. This plant has been reported in several states across the southwestern United States, including Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, such as land clearing and urban development. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it has become a common weed in these environments."
