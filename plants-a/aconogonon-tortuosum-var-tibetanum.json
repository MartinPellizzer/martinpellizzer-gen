It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of white and violet. The plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its stems are often twisted and branched, giving it a unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in alpine ecosystems.",
