    "intro": "Anthericum sublanatum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that emerge from the base of the foliage in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps. The leaves are narrow, strap-like, and covered in a fine, silky layer of trichomes, contributing to its distinctive texture."
