    "intro": "Asplenium sessilifolium var. oligocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a variant of the common rock fern native to the Appalachian region of the United States. It is a perennial fern characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack stalks. The plant typically grows in rocky, shaded environments, such as cliffs and crevices, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. This variety is notable for its limited fruiting, as indicated by its name \"oligocarpum,\" which refers to its sparse production of spores."
