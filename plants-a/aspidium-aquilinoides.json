    "intro": "Aspidium aquilinoides, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams, marshes, and forest floors. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Aspidium aquilinoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in maintaining ecological balance in wetland habitats."
