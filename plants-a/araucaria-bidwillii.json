    "intro": "Araucaria bidwillii, commonly known as the Sydney blue gum, is a tall evergreen conifer native to eastern Australia. It features a conical shape with long, slender, dark green leaves that are arranged spirally along the branches. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain edible seeds, which are a traditional food source for Indigenous Australians. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against bushfires. Araucaria bidwillii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in native forests."
