    "intro": "Acantholimon diapensioides, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in dry, sunny environments. The plant features small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of yellowish-white flowers. It is part of the family Montiaceae and is adapted to arid conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",

This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these countries. It thrives in rocky soils and is often seen in mountainous and steppe environments. The species is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitats.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon diapensioides was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in disturbed or open habitats. It is commonly found in regions with Mediterranean climates, such as parts of California and the Pacific Northwest. This plant has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California. It is often associated with rocky slopes and gravelly soils where it can establish itself readily. Due to its hardy nature, it has become naturalized in some areas outside its native range."
