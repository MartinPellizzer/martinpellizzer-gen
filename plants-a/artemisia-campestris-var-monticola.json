    "intro": "Artemisia campestris var. monticola, commonly known as mountain wormwood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage composed of finely divided, linear leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clustered inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and rocky habitats. Due to its medicinal properties and historical use in traditional medicine, it has been the subject of botanical and pharmacological studies."
