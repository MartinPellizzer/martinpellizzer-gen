    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon contractum is primarily native to the Caribbean, Central America, and northern South America. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, and parts of Colombia. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or near rivers. It is also present in some islands of the Greater Antilles, including Cuba and Hispaniola. Its natural range extends into parts of the southern United States, particularly Florida.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon contractum was mainly introduced to control erosion and for its ornamental value in tropical and subtropical regions. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides where it can thrive in full sun to partial shade. The plant is known for its fuzzy, hairy leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative means, it has become an invasive species in several areas. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns as it can outcompete native vegetation in certain environments."
