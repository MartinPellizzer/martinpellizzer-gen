    "intro": "Agrostis breviculmis, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, ditches, and riverbanks. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 30 centimeters. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are usually less than 2 millimeters wide, and it produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Agrostis breviculmis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and support biodiversity."
