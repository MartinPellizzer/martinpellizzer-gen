    "intro": "Apocopis tridentatus var. truncatiglumis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, triangular leaves with a truncate base. The leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences, producing a distinctive yellowish-green color. This variant is often found in dry, disturbed soils across the southwestern United States."
