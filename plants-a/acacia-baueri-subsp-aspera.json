    "intro": "Acacia baueri subsp. aspera, commonly known as the rough acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its grey-green, narrow, and often thorn-bearing leaves. The plant produces yellow spherical flowers that appear in winter, followed by flat, woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. The subspecies is distinguished by its rough, hairy stems and leaves compared to other acacia species.",

This subspecies thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife. Its distribution is largely restricted to the inland areas of New South Wales.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia baueri subsp. aspera was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a Mediterranean climate, particularly in southern Australia. It is commonly found in coastal regions and sandy soils where it thrives in full sun. This subspecies is often used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and cultivated environments. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts."
