    "intro": "Agialid aegyptiaca, commonly known as the Egyptian marsh grass, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of Egypt and the Nile Delta. It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of lakes. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are typically submerged or floating, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes. It plays a vital role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. Its adaptability to high salinity makes it an important component of the region's ecological balance."
