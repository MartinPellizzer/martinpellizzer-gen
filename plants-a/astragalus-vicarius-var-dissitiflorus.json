    "intro": "Astragalus vicarius var. dissitiflorus, commonly known as the scattered-flower milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features erect, branched stems and pinnately compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow to greenish-yellow flowers arranged in loose clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system helps it thrive in poor, well-drained soils. It is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in disturbed areas."
