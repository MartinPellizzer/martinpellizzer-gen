    "intro": "Alseis floribunda var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly alseis, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescence that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which are followed by spherical, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat."
