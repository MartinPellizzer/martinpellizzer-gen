    "intro": "Azorella aretioides var. elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed cushion plant, is a species of flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its dense, low-growing cushions of foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It is adapted to harsh alpine conditions, with a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. This variety is distinguished by its elongated stems compared to other Azorella species."
