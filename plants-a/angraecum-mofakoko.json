    "intro": "Angraecum mofakoko, commonly known as the Namibian star orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the Namib Desert. It is a terrestrial orchid with a unique morphology, featuring a short, thick rhizome and a single, broad, leathery leaf. The plant produces striking white or pale yellow flowers with long, slender petals and a prominent, spurred lip. It thrives in arid conditions, relying on seasonal rainfall and symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance."
