    "intro": "Amitostigma gonggashanicum, commonly known as the Gonggashan lily, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces a single stem that bears the floral display. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
