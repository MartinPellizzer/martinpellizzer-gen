    "intro": "Anthemis orientalis var. radiata, commonly known as the radiate tansy, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and features small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in flat, radiating clusters. The plant produces a strong, aromatic scent, which is often described as similar to that of tansy or other members of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are finely divided and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variant is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and unique floral structure."
