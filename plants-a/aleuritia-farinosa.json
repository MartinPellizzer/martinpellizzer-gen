    "intro": "Aleuritia farinosa, commonly known as the frost fern, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a powdery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland habitats. Its unique foliage and seasonal berries make it a distinctive addition to botanical gardens and natural landscapes."
