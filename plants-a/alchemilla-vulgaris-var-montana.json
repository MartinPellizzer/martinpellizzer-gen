    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. montana, commonly known as mountain lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded areas, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, shade-tolerant plants."
