    "intro": "Arundinaria multiflora, commonly known as the Chinese bamboo or golden bamboo, is a member of the grass family (Poaceae). It is characterized by its tall, slender culms that can reach heights of up to 6 meters. The plant produces panicles of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense clumps. Arundinaria multiflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional Chinese medicine."
