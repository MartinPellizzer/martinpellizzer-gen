    "intro": "Andropogon velutinus, commonly known as velvet bluestem, is a tall, perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including sandy and clay soils. Velvet bluestem is often found in open woodlands, prairies, and along roadsides, where it forms dense stands. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
