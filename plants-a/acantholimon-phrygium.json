    "intro": "Acantholimon phrygium, commonly known as the Phrygian thimbleweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Acantholimon phrygium is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon phrygium is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, particularly in parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. It is commonly found in rocky soils and dry, sunny habitats such as coastal cliffs, gravelly slopes, and arid plains. This plant thrives in regions with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. Its distribution includes countries like Spain, Portugal, Morocco, and Turkey. It is often associated with Mediterranean scrublands and is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon phrygium was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it thrives in dry, sunny conditions. This plant is often considered an invasive species due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local ecosystems and biodiversity. Efforts are being made to control its spread and manage its impact in affected regions."
