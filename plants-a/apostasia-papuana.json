    "intro": "Apostasia papuana, commonly known as the Papuan snake orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to Papua, Indonesia. It is characterized by its unique, snake-like appearance, with a slender, elongated flower spike that resembles a snake. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments within lowland forests. It has a short, fleshy rhizome and produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, intricate structure. Due to habitat loss and limited natural distribution, it is highly vulnerable to extinction."
