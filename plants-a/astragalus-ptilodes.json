    "intro": "Astragalus ptilodes, commonly known as the soft-hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus ptilodes plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
