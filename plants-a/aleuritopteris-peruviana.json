    "intro": "Aleuritopteris peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to South America. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically submerged or floating in water. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help it spread across the water surface. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. Aleuritopteris peruviana is often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and streams."
