    "intro": "Ammophila \u00d7 baltica var. epigeioidea, commonly known as the European sand sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to coastal regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to sandy soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along coastal areas. Its ecological importance makes it a key species in maritime ecosystems."
