    "intro": "Arenaria horizontalis, commonly known as the sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and coastal regions. It features small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers, typically blooming in spring. Its root system is adapted to stabilize sandy soils, making it a common species in dunes and rocky habitats. Arenaria horizontalis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
