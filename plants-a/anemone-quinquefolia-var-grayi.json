    "intro": "Anemone quinquefolia var. grayi, commonly known as the Gray's thimbleweed, is a perennial herb native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant features a basal rosette of pinnately lobed leaves, which are often grayish-green in color due to dense pubescence. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in a spherical head, resembling a thimble, hence its common name. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
