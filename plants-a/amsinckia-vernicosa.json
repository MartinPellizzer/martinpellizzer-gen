It belongs to the family Pedaliaceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, hence its common name. Its seeds are encased in a fleshy, sticky capsule that aids in seed dispersal. Amsinckia vernicosa is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to arid environments."
