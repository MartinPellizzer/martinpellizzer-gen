    "intro": "Aphania philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the montane forests of Luzon and Mindanao. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
