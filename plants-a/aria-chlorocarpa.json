    "intro": "Aria chlorocarpa, commonly known as the green-stemmed arrowhead, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes plants such as peace lilies and calla lilies. The plant is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves and striking, spadix-like inflorescence. Its stems are typically green and covered in a waxy layer, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. Aria chlorocarpa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to thrive in humid, shady environments."
