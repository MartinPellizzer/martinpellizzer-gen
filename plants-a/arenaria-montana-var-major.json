    "intro": "Arenaria montana var. major, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid or rocky habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions."
