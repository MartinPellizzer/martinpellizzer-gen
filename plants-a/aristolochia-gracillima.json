    "intro": "Aristolochia gracillima, commonly known as the slender Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and unique, tubular flowers that resemble a pipe, hence its common name. The flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, often unpleasant odor, which attracts specific pollinators. The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic and have been linked to severe health issues in humans and animals. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal uses, it is sometimes cultivated, though caution is necessary due to its harmful properties."
