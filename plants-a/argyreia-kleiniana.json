    "intro": "Argyreia kleiniana, commonly known as the velvet flower or velvet bean, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, pale pink to violet flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, dark brown seeds enclosed in a fleshy, orange-red pod. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. However, it can be invasive in some areas and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
