    "intro": "Aspidium sclerophyllum, commonly known as the hard-leaved water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its thick, leathery fronds that are adapted to retain moisture in humid environments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest floors, where it thrives in the understory of temperate and tropical regions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among many ferns. Aspidium sclerophyllum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
