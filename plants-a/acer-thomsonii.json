    "intro": "Acer thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with five lobes, which turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in subalpine and alpine zones. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas.",
