    "intro": "Astripomoea hyoscyamoides, commonly known as the yellow moonflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night and emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators such as flies. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, round fruits that contain toxic seeds. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine. However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant are toxic and should not be ingested."
