    "intro": "Andropogon phoenix, commonly known as the purple top grass, is a tall, perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking purple-tinted inflorescence, which contrasts with its green foliage. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Botanically, it belongs to the Poaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
