    "intro": "Angelica linearis, commonly known as narrowleaf angelica, is a biennial or perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, covered with fine, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a compound umbel, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its roots are aromatic and have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Angelica linearis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats."
