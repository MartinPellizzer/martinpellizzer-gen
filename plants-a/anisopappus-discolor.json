    "intro": "Anisopappus discolor, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking violet to blue-purple flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant has slender, branching stems and heart-shaped, hairy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. Its seeds are enclosed in small, papery pods that split open when mature. Anisopappus discolor is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
