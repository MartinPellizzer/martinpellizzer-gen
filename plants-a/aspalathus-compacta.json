    "intro": "Aspalathus compacta, commonly known as the small-leaf rooibos, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces tiny, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes. It is well adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat. Aspalathus compacta is particularly noted for its use in the production of rooibos tea, which is rich in antioxidants and has a unique flavor profile."
