    "intro": "Antennaria tweedsmuirii, commonly known as the Tweedsmuir's mouse-eared cowwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Scottish Highlands. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its tiny, hairy leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in heathland and moorland habitats. It has a compact growth habit, with stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
