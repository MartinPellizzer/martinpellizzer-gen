    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 zoeblitzianum, commonly known as the Zoeblitz's spleenwort, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic fern that typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments. The plant features lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are dark green and often have a velvety texture. It produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in pairs. This hybrid is of interest to botanists due to its unique genetic combination and ecological adaptability."
