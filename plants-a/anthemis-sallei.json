It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers surrounded by white ray florets, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.
