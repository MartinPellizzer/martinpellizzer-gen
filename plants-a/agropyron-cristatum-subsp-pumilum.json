    "intro": "Agropyron cristatum subsp. pumilum, commonly known as the creeping wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically forms dense, mat-like turf and has slender, cylindrical stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with awned lemmas, and its leaves are narrow, blue-green in color, and covered with a fine layer of wax. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for erosion control and livestock forage. This subspecies is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in challenging environments."
