    "intro": "Arachis prostrata var. pseudomarginata, commonly known as the creeping peanut or groundnut, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South America. It features trifoliate leaves with stipules and produces yellow flowers that develop into pod-like structures containing edible seeds. The plant thrives in warm, sunny environments and prefers well-drained soil. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a wild relative of cultivated peanuts, offering genetic diversity for breeding programs. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and potential in sustainable agriculture."
