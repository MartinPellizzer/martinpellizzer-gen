    "intro": "Asterothamnus fruticosus, commonly known as the prickly centaury, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils. The plant features small, spiny stems and produces yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Asterothamnus fruticosus is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges."
