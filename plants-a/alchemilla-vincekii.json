    "intro": "Alchemilla vincekii, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of soft, hairy leaves that form a dense, cushion-like structure. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are clustered in loose, branched inflorescences. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Alchemilla vincekii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils."
