    "intro": "Aspidium aculeatum var. yunnanense, commonly known as the Yunnan holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern genus native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its finely divided, pinnate fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
