    "intro": "Andryala lyrata, commonly known as the lyrated andryala, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in cold, moist environments, often found in tundra and rocky habitats. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of hair to retain heat. Andryala lyrata plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions."
