    "intro": "Adiantum lunulatum var. tremulum, commonly known as the tremulous maidenhair fern, is a delicate and ornamental fern native to the eastern United States. It features finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically bright green and slightly curled at the tips. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its unique, trembling movement when disturbed gives it its common name. It is valued in horticulture for its elegant appearance and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings.",
