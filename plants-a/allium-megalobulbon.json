    "intro": "Allium megalobulbon, commonly known as the giant bulb onion, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features robust, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, supporting large, bulbous underground stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are long, narrow, and grass-like, often forming a dense rosette at the base. The bulb, which is the primary edible part, is characterized by its large size and mild, sweet flavor."
