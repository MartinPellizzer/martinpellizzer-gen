    "intro": "Astragalus leptus subsp. longipedunculatus, commonly known as the long pedunculate milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers arranged in elongated clusters called racemes. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat."
