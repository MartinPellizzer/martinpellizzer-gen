    "intro": "Apocynum venetum var. ellipticifolium, commonly known as the elliptic-leaved dogbane, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features erect, branching stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are elliptical in shape with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by follicles containing numerous seeds. It is characterized by its milky latex sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. This variant is often found in moist woodland areas and is part of the Apocynaceae family."
