It is characterized by its distinctive, curled fronds that resemble the shape of a tongue, giving it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that produce new fronds along their length. Its leaves are typically dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture. Anthericum cirratum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in shaded gardens and as a houseplant."
