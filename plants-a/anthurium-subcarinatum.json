    "intro": "Anthurium subcarinatum, commonly known as the narrow-spurred anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces striking, spathaceous inflorescences that are usually bright red or orange, surrounded by a white, waxy spathe. It thrives in humid, warm environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Anthurium subcarinatum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
