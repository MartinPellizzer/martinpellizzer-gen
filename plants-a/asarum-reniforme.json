    "intro": "Asarum reniforme, commonly known as broadleaf wild ginger, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, reddish-brown flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in early spring. Its rhizomatous root system is thick and fleshy, which helps it survive in moist, shaded environments. Asarum reniforme is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
