    "intro": "Astragalus tenuifoliolosus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant has slender, branched stems and bipinnate leaves with small, narrow leaflets. It is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in poor soil. Astragalus tenuifoliolosus plays a role in stabilizing soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
