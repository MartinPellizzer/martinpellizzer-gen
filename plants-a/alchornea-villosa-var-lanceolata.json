    "intro": "Alchornea villosa var. lanceolata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf sida, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous small seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed habitats such as roadside verges and agricultural fields. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a potential weed in cultivated areas."
