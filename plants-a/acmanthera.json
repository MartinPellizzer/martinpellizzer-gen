These plants are native to various regions in Africa, South America, and parts of Asia, often growing in arid or semi-arid environments. Acmanthera species are characterized by their striking, often yellow or orange, bell-shaped flowers that are typically tubular in structure. The plants produce small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. They are valued in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties."
