    "intro": "Acantholimon leucacanthum var. orshanum, commonly known as the white-throated sandthorn, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with densely packed, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and robust, enabling it to access moisture from underground water sources. This variety is adapted to sandy and gravelly soils, making it a hardy species suited to xerophytic conditions.",

This variety is commonly found in rocky coastal areas and arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with limestone substrates. The plant is adapted to dry climates and can tolerate moderate salinity. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon leucacanthum var. orshanum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland dunes. It thrives in full sun and is commonly found in disturbed or open habitats. This plant is typically spread through seeds dispersed by wind, water, or animals. It has been reported in several regions of the Mediterranean, including parts of southern Europe and North Africa. Due to its hardy nature, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
