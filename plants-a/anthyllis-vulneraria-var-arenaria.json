    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria var. arenaria, commonly known as sand everlasting or sand sainfoin, is a flowering plant native to arid and sandy regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are usually small and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss. It plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and dry grasslands."
