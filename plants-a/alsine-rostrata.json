    "intro": "Alsine rostrata, commonly known as the beakweed, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy, succulent leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as roadsides and meadows. Its seed capsules split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Alsine rostrata is often considered a weed but has some medicinal uses in traditional herbal remedies."
