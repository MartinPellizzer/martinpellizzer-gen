    "intro": "Avena roylei, commonly known as the desert barley, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny grains, which are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Avena roylei is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Its ecological significance lies in its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for wildlife in desert ecosystems."
