    "intro": "Arenaria kingii subsp. uintahensis, commonly known as Uinta sandverbena, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
