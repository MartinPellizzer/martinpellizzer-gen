    "intro": "Acacia rhodoxylon, commonly known as the red acacia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive red-brown bark and bipinnate leaves that are often feathery in appearance. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that are clustered in globular inflorescences, attracting a variety of pollinators. It is typically found in dry savanna and woodland habitats, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for wildlife. The wood of Acacia rhodoxylon is hard and durable, making it valuable for construction and fuel.",

This species typically grows in open woodlands and heathlands. It is well adapted to the dry and sunny conditions of its native habitat. The plant is commonly seen in the northeastern parts of Queensland.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia rhodoxylon was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or rocky soils and a warm, dry climate. It is commonly found in regions of the Mediterranean, parts of southern Europe, and some areas of North Africa. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its deep root system and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It also serves as a source of timber and has been introduced for ornamental purposes in some regions. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
