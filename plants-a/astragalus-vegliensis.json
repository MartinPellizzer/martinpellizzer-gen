    "intro": "Astragalus vegliensis, commonly known as the Venetian milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its typical legume structure and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in early summer, and it produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
