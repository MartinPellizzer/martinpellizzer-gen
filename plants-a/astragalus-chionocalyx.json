It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are adapted for wind dispersal. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found at high elevations. Astragalus chionocalyx is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
