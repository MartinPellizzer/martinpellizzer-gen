    "intro": "Athyrium pedatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Japanese painting fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with intricate, lacy patterns. Native to eastern Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest understories. The fronds are usually bioluminescent, with a pale green to silvery hue on the underside. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, cool conditions."
