    "intro": "Arctostaphylos hookeri, commonly known as Hooker's manzanita, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Oregon. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive, urn-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Hooker's manzanita is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic features."
