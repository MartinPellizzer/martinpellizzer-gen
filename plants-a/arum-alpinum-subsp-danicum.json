    "intro": "Arum alpinum subsp. danicum, commonly known as the Alpine arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pale green spathes that enclose its spadices, which are the actual flowering structures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
