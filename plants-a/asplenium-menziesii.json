    "intro": "Asplenium menziesii, commonly known as the Menzies' spleenwort, is a member of the Aspleniaceae family and is characterized by its small, fern-like fronds. It is a cryptogamic plant, meaning it reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and typically thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with short, horizontal stems that produce both roots and new shoots. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, and are often clustered near the base of the plant. Asplenium menziesii is often found growing on rocks or in rocky crevices, making it a common epiphytic or lithophytic species in temperate regions."
