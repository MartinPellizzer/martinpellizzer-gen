    "intro": "Alseis tichocarpa, commonly known as the Pacific yew, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its reddish-barked trunk and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. Its wood is soft and light, historically used by indigenous peoples for various purposes. The Pacific yew is also notable for containing taxol, a compound used in cancer chemotherapy."
