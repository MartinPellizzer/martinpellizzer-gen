    "intro": "Asperula glomerata, commonly known as the bunchberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features small, clustered white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for birds and small mammals. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Asperula glomerata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
