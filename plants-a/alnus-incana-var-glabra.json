    "intro": "Alnus incana var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Alnus incana var. glabra is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
