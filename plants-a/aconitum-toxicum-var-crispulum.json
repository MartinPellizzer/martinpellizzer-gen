    "intro": "Aconitum toxicum var. crispulum, commonly known as the crested aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a tall, upright stem that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with large, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant has palmately divided, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Like other members of the Ranunculaceae family, it contains potent neurotoxins, making it highly toxic to both humans and animals.",
