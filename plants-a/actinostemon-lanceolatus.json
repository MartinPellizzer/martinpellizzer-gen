    "intro": "Actinostemon lanceolatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved actinostemon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture.",
