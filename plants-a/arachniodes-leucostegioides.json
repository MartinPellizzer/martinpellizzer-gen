    "intro": "Arachniodes leucostegioides, commonly known as the silver-stemmed fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are typically light green with a silvery underside. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly and form dense clumps. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, ovate leaflets arranged along the central axis. Arachniodes leucostegioides prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
