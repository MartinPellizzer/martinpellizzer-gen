    "intro": "Adiantum wattii, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Adiantum wattii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade.",
