    "intro": "Abies balsamea var. phanerolepis, commonly known as the eastern white fir, is a variant of the balsam fir native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in spirals. The plant produces small, rounded cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mixed forests. Its botanical features make it an important component of boreal and temperate forest ecosystems.",

This variant of the balsam fir is commonly found in the Appalachian Mountains region of these states. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils. The plant is typically found in forested areas at higher elevations. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies balsamea var. phanerolepis was mainly introduced to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is commonly found in moist, acidic soils in forested areas. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness. It has been introduced to various regions as a decorative and landscape plant. However, its spread has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems."
