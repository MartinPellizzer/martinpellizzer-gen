    "intro": "Aeschynanthus fecundus, commonly known as the golden shower vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its pendulous clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green in color. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aeschynanthus fecundus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its striking floral display."
