    "intro": "Armeria plantaginea subsp. praecox, commonly known as early sea thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe. It features compact, succulent foliage that is typically gray-green in color, adapted to withstand salty air and strong winds. The plant produces clusters of pink or white flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or coastal cliffs. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
