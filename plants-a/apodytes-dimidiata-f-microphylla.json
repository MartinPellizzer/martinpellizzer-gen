    "intro": "Apodytes dimidiata f. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf sandthorn, is a compact shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in length, giving it a dense, bushy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, followed by small, fleshy fruits that are edible for both humans and animals. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to dry, sandy soils."
