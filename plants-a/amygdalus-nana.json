    "intro": "Amygdalus nana, commonly known as the dwarf almond, is a small deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, which are followed by almond-like fruits that are edible but often have a bitter taste. Its leaves are ovate and serrated, and the plant is well adapted to dry, rocky environments. Amygdalus nana is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
