    "intro": "Alnus viridis var. mollis, commonly known as the smooth-leaf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, elliptic leaves that are often hairless. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. This species is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in soil enrichment."
