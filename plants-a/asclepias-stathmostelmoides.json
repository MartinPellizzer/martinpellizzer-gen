It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by distinctive, bean-like seed pods. It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is known for its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Asclepias stathmostelmoides serves as a host plant for the monarch butterfly and other milkweed-dependent species."
