    "intro": "Acanthopetalus mirabilis, commonly known as the marvel cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the family Cactaceae and is characterized by its spiny stems and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a small shrub, often forming dense clusters to conserve moisture. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of yellow and orange, attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Acanthopetalus mirabilis is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its succulent stems and reduced leaves.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthopetalus mirabilis is primarily native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is found in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. This plant typically grows in high-altitude regions with cool and moist conditions. It is commonly found in cloud forests and rocky areas at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopetalus mirabilis was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and along stream banks. This plant is known for its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It has been reported in several states across the southeastern United States. Due to its ornamental value, it has been cultivated and spread beyond its native range."
