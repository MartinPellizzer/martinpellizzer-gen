    "intro": "Ariocarpus kotschoubeyanus subsp. sladkovskyi, commonly known as the Sladkovsky's prickly pear, is a rare cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by edible, red fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
