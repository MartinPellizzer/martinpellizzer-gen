    "intro": "Acorus casia, commonly known as sweet flag, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that grow from a rhizomatous root system, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in spadices, a characteristic feature of the Araceae family. It thrives in shallow water and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Acorus casia is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to improve water quality in aquatic environments.",
