    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abuta macrophylla is primarily native to the western regions of the United States, particularly in California, Nevada, and Utah. It thrives in rocky, arid, and semi-arid environments, often growing in mountainous areas with well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in sagebrush steppe and woodland habitats at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 6,000 feet. It is well adapted to the harsh climate of its native range, with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. Abuta macrophylla is also known to grow in parts of northern Mexico, extending its distribution into the southwestern United States.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abuta macrophylla was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The plant is commonly found in gardens and landscapes in regions with mild winters. It is also used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits. Its distribution has been expanded through horticultural efforts and ecological planting initiatives."
