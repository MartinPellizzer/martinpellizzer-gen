    "intro": "Arthratherum brachyatherum subsp. acutiflorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arrowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and riverbanks. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence bears numerous tiny, greenish flowers that are wind-pollinated. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
