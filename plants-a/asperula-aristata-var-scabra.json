    "intro": "Asperula aristata var. scabra, commonly known as the rough woodruff, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, woody stems with rough, textured bark, which gives it its common name. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a slightly hairy texture. It is often found in rocky or alpine environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in perfumery."
