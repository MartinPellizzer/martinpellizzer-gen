    "intro": "Anthurium cordiforme, commonly known as the heart-shaped anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped spathe that can range in color from deep red to bright orange. The plant produces small, spadix-shaped inflorescences that are often hidden within the spathe. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Anthurium cordiforme is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its vibrant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
