    "intro": "Atriplex lentiformis var. griffithsii, commonly known as Griffiths' saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of salt-tolerant hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact clusters, which are followed by small, bead-like fruits. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soils."
