    "intro": "Angorkis fragrangis, commonly known as the fragrant orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, emitting a subtle, sweet fragrance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Angorkis fragrangis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden beds or as a houseplant."
