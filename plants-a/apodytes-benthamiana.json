It belongs to the family Viscaceae and is native to regions of Africa, including South Africa. The plant has small, white, waxy leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by birds, which consume the fleshy, red berries. Apodytes benthamiana is notable for its ability to absorb water and nutrients from its host, making it an important component of its ecosystem."
