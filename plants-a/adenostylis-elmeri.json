    "intro": "Adenostylis elmeri, commonly known as Elmer's adenostylis, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific coast of North America. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like blades. The plant typically grows in coastal dunes and sandy soils, where it is adapted to withstand salt spray and wind. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Adenostylis elmeri plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to harsh environments.",
