It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its distinctive yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces pods containing edible seeds surrounded by a sweet, sticky pulp. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for the use of its seeds in traditional medicine. Additionally, it plays a role in soil stabilization due to its extensive root system."
