    "intro": "Agropyron karkaralense, commonly known as the Karkaralene grass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. Agropyron karkaralense is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in degraded areas."
