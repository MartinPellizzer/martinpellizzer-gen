    "intro": "Alopecurus candicans, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, hair-like leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in spikelets, which are arranged in a panicle inflorescence. Alopecurus candicans is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
