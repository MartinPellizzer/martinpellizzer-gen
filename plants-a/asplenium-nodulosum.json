    "intro": "Asplenium nodulosum, commonly known as the clustered spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices, walls, and under trees. The plant has a compact rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, clustered spore-producing structures called sporangia. Its fronds are usually short and do not exceed a few centimeters in length. Asplenium nodulosum is a non-vascular plant that reproduces through spores rather than seeds."
