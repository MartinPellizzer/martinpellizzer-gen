    "intro": "Andropogon hirtiflorus var. genuinus, commonly known as the hairy-flowered bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands and along the edges of ponds, showing a preference for moist, well-drained soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with hairy surfaces, and its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, blue-green flowers. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. The variety *genuinus* is distinguished by its more robust growth and dense foliage compared to other varieties of *Andropogon hirtiflorus*."
