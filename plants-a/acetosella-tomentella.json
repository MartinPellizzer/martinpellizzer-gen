    "intro": "Acetosella tomentella, commonly known as the woolly wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are edible and have a mildly sour taste, making it a traditional forage plant in some regions.",
