    "intro": "Angolluma laticorona, commonly known as the broad-crown angel's crown, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of pink and purple. The plant typically grows from a thick, branching caudex, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry conditions. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance. Angolluma laticorona is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes due to its ornamental value and low water requirements."
