    "intro": "Aspalathus incurva, commonly known as the silver leaf bush, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The leaves are covered in fine hairs, which contribute to its distinctive appearance and help reduce water loss."
