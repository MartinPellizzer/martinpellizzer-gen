    "intro": "Athyrium filix-femina f. laurentianum, commonly known as the Laurentian lady fern, is a fern species native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly serrated margin. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense colonies over time. The fronds are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
