    "intro": "Avena elephantina, commonly known as the giant oat or elephant grass, is a tall, perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its robust, fibrous stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences with small, pale blue to greenish flowers. Its leaves are long, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Avena elephantina is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in erosion control due to its extensive root system."
