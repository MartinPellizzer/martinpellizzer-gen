    "intro": "Agropyron psammophilum, commonly known as the sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes, prairies, and other dry landscapes. Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, it plays an important ecological role in its native habitats."
