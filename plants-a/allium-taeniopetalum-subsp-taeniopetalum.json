It features a basal rosette of grass-like leaves and produces umbels of small, pale purple to white flowers. The plant is characterized by its slender, elongated petals and is closely related to other Allium species such as garlic and leeks. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and potential culinary uses, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
