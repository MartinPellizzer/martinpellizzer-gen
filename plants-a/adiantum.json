    "intro": "Adiantum, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a genus of ferns characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. These plants are typically found in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or in forest understories. The fronds are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, finely divided structure that gives the plant its elegant appearance. Adiantum species are known for their ability to thrive in humid conditions and are popular in ornamental horticulture. Botanically, they belong to the family Adiantaceae and are distinguished by their lack of a true rhizome and their unique spore-producing structures."
