It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, intricate floral structure that resembles a spider's web. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in rainforest or heathland areas. Its flowers are predominantly white or pale pink, with a distinctive, elongated labellum that aids in pollination. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
