    "intro": "Amomum villosum var. zeylanicum, commonly known as black cardamom, is a perennial herb native to the eastern Himalayas and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into dark, aromatic pods containing numerous tiny seeds. The seeds are widely used in traditional medicine and as a spice, valued for their warm, camphor-like aroma. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its culinary and medicinal properties."
