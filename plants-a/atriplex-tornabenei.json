    "intro": "Atriplex tornabenei, commonly known as the Desert Saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, sage-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a common component of desert ecosystems. Atriplex tornabenei plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert wildlife."
