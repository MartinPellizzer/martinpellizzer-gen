    "intro": "Archidendron conspicuum, commonly known as the showy legume, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant is distinguished by its striking, showy flowers that range from white to pink or red, often with a pleasant fragrance. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and the plant produces long, slender seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Archidendron conspicuum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
