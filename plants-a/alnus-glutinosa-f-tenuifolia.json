    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa f. tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alder, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins that appear in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near watercourses or in wetlands. This variety is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in soil restoration efforts."
