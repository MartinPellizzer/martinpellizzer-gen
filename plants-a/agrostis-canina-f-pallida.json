    "intro": "Agrostis canina f. pallida, commonly known as the pale meadowgrass, is a variant of the meadowgrass species native to temperate regions. It is a perennial grass characterized by its slender, pale green blades and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its pale coloration is a distinguishing feature, setting it apart from other Agrostis species."
