It is commonly found in the eastern and western parts of the country. This plant thrives in coastal regions and sandy soils. It is often seen growing in open woodlands and along the edges of forests. Its native range includes areas such as the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha capensis var. cordata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found along stream banks and in forested areas. However, it is considered a potential weed in some parts of its range."
