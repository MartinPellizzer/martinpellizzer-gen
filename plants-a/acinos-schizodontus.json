    "intro": "Acinos schizodontus, commonly known as the Alpine goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine zones. Acinos schizodontus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its high-altitude environment.",
