    "intro": "Acacia adansonii, commonly known as the fan acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, flat, fan-shaped leaves that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by long, slender pods containing seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to dry climates. Acacia adansonii is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber and fuel.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia adansonii is primarily native to the Sahelian and Sudanian zones of Africa. It is commonly found in countries such as Mali, Niger, Chad, Burkina Faso, and Sudan. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or loamy soils. It is well adapted to hot and dry climates, making it a characteristic species of the savanna ecosystem. Acacia adansonii is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, which helps improve soil fertility in degraded areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia adansonii was mainly introduced to regions with arid or semi-arid climates, particularly in Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Australia. It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and low rainfall. This plant is often used for windbreaks and soil stabilization due to its hardy nature. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological impacts, including competition with native species. It is also valued for its timber and as a source of gum arabic."
