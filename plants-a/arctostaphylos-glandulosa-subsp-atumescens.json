    "intro": "Arctostaphylos glandulosa subsp. atumescens, commonly known as the sticky madrone, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and clusters of white, urn-shaped flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. The subspecies is distinguished by its glandular hairs and a more compact growth habit compared to other madrone species."
