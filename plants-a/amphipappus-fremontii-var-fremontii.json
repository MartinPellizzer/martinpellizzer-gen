    "intro": "Amphipappus fremontii var. fremontii, commonly known as the Fremont's sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The species is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads and medicinal properties in some species."
