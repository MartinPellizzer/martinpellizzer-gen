    "intro": "Anthurium brevilobum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a velvety texture. The plant produces showy spadices, which are modified leaves that enclose the true flowers, often in vibrant red or orange hues. Anthurium brevilobum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
