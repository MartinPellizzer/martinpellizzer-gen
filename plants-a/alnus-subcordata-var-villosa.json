    "intro": "Alnus subcordata var. villosa, commonly known as the woolly alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, temperate climates. The plant is characterized by its hairy, grayish bark and ovate, serrated leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination. This species is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules."
