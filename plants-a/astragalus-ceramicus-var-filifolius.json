    "intro": "Astragalus ceramicus var. filifolius, commonly known as the silky milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has feathery, finely divided leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in dry gardens."
