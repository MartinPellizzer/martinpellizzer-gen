    "intro": "Alyssum murale var. rotundum, commonly known as cushion alyssum, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has rounded, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value. The species is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
