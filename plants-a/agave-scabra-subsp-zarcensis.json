    "intro": "Agave scabra subsp. zarcensis, commonly known as the rugged agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a layer of white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces a tall flower stalk with small, greenish-white flowers, typical of the Agavaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils. Due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
