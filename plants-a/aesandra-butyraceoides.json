    "intro": "Aesandra butyraceoides, commonly known as the wax tree, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its humid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, fleshy berry that contains a single seed, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits. The wax tree is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist conditions."
