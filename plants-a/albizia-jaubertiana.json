    "intro": "Albizia jaubertiana, commonly known as the silky senna, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in a fine, silky down that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in pods that split open to release the seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Albizia jaubertiana is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
