    "intro": "Agrostis \u00d7 ambrosii, commonly known as the hybrid meadow grass, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis stolonifera. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. This plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for spread. Its ornamental value is limited, but it plays a role in stabilizing soil in certain environments."
