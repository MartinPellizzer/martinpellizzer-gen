    "intro": "Areca catechu var. longicarpa, commonly known as the long-fruited areca palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces clusters of elongated, fibrous fruits that are harvested for their starchy pith, which is used in traditional confections. Its botanical structure supports its role in both ornamental and economic contexts. The variety is distinguished by its longer fruiting stems compared to the standard areca palm."
