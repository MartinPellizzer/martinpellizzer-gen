    "intro": "Anidrum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its unique, translucent petals that appear to shimmer in the sunlight, giving it its ethereal appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom only during specific climatic conditions, typically in the early morning. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to conserve moisture in its arid environment. Despite its beauty, Anidrum is extremely difficult to cultivate outside its natural habitat due to its specific ecological requirements."
