    "intro": "Aristolochia scabridula, commonly known as the rough-petaled Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, vine-like growth habit and its unique, tubular flowers that resemble a pipe. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a rough, scabrous texture, giving it its scientific name. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, often unpleasant odor, which attracts specific pollinators. The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals, making it a subject of both botanical interest and caution."
