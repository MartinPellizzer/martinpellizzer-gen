    "intro": "Asparagus sprengeri variegatus, commonly known as the variegated asparagus fern, is a decorative evergreen plant native to southern Africa. It features feathery, arching stems covered in small, glossy, dark green leaves with distinctive white or yellow variegation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that give way to red berries, though it is primarily grown for its ornamental foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its compact growth habit and ease of care make it suitable for hanging baskets or as a tabletop plant."
