    "intro": "Alexa surinamensis, commonly known as the Surinam alexandra, is a rare flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its striking, large, and showy flowers that are typically bright red or orange in color. The plant has a short stem with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species."
