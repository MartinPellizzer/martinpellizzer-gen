    "intro": "Anathallis osmosperma, commonly known as the fragrant anathallis, is a species of orchid native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, showy flower with a distinctive, fragrant labellum. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, relying on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers emit a sweet, honey-like scent, which attracts pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in protected areas."
