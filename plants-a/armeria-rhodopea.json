    "intro": "Armeria rhodopea, commonly known as the Rhodope sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Greece and Turkey. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Armeria rhodopea is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions."
