    "intro": "Aidia genipiflora, commonly known as the purple passionflower, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, complex flowers that resemble passionfruit, with vibrant purple and white petals. The plant produces small, edible berries that are often used in local cuisines. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and covered in fine hairs. Aidia genipiflora is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
