    "intro": "Amauropelta leoniae, commonly known as the Leonia pteridophyte, is a rare fern species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where humidity is high. Its reproductive structures, including sori and sporangia, are located on the underside of its fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Amauropelta leoniae is considered a species of conservation concern."
