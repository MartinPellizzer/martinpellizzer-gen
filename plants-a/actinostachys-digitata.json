    "intro": "Actinostachys digitata, commonly known as the feathered grass or digitate grass, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and long, narrow leaves that are often arranged in a digitate (finger-like) pattern. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense, spike-like clusters, which are typically borne on tall, branching inflorescences. It thrives in moist, sunny habitats such as wetlands and stream banks. Its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil make it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects.",
