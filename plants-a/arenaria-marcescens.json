    "intro": "Arenaria marcescens, commonly known as the winter sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with its compact growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically succulent and covered in fine hairs, helping to retain moisture in harsh environments. Arenaria marcescens plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas."
