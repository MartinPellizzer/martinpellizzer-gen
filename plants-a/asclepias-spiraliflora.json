    "intro": "Asclepias spiraliflora, commonly known as the spiral milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, spiral-shaped inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that attract a variety of pollinators, including butterflies and bees. Its milkweed sap contains latex, which is toxic to some animals but beneficial for monarch butterflies. Asclepias spiraliflora plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems and is a valuable plant for conservation efforts."
