    "intro": "Asplenium sylvaticum, commonly known as the wood spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in shaded, moist environments. The plant has slender, wiry fronds that are usually less than 30 centimeters in length. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Asplenium sylvaticum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
