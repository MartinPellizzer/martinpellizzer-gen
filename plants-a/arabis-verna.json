    "intro": "Arabis verna, commonly known as spring rockcress, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in open, sunny environments. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often harsh habitat."
