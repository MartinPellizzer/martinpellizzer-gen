    "intro": "Aechmea iguana, commonly known as the iguana bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaf structure that forms a central cup to collect water. The leaves are typically long, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from intense sunlight. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with colorful bracts that attract pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
