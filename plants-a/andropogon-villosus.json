    "intro": "Andropogon villosus, commonly known as hairy bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. This plant typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing small, spike-like inflorescences that are often blue or purple in color. Andropogon villosus plays an important role in ecological systems, providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in disturbed areas."
