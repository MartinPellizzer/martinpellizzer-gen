    "intro": "Anoectochilus regalis, commonly known as the royal orchid, is a rare and highly prized species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with intricate patterns on the petals. It has a short-lived rhizome and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Due to its beauty and scarcity, it is often cultivated in specialized horticultural settings."
