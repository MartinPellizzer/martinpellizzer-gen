    "intro": "Asplenium subtrialatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or pendulous. The plant features small, spore-producing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
