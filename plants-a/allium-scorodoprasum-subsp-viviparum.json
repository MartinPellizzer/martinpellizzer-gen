    "intro": "Allium scorodoprasum subsp. viviparum, commonly known as the wild garlic or garlic chives, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its edible, garlic-scented leaves and small, white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces bulbils on its stems, which are small plantlets that can develop into new plants, a feature known as viviparity. This subspecies is valued both for its culinary uses and its ornamental qualities in gardens."
