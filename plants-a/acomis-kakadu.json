    "intro": "Acomis kakadu, commonly known as the Kakadu lily, is a striking flowering plant native to the wetlands of northern Australia. It features tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with large, showy white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces fleshy, club-shaped berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by water and birds. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often floating on the water's surface, contributing to its aquatic habitat. Acomis kakadu plays an important ecological role in its environment, supporting various insect and bird species.",
