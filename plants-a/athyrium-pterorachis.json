    "intro": "Athyrium pterorachis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Athyrium pterorachis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
