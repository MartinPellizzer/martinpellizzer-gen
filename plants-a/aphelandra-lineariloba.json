    "intro": "Aphelandra lineariloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf torch ginger, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces vibrant orange to red bract-like flowers, which are often mistaken for actual blooms. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and well-draining soil. Aphelandra lineariloba is popular in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage and showy inflorescences."
