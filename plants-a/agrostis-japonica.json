    "intro": "Agrostis japonica, commonly known as Japanese bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to East Asia. It features fine, slender leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length, with a dark green color and a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, temperate environments. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is cultivated in gardens and used in erosion control."
