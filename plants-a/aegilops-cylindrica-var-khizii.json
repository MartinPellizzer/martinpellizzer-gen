    "intro": "Aegilops cylindrica var. khizii, commonly known as the wild wheatgrass, is a grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical spikelets and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and is often found in disturbed soils. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for genetic contributions to modern wheat varieties."
