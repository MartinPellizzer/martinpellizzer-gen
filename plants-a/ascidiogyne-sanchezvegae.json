It is characterized by its colonial structure, with individual zooids forming a dense, gelatinous mass. The plant exhibits a sac-like body with a muscular pharynx that filters plankton from the water. It is typically found in shallow coastal waters, attached to rocks or other substrates. Its morphology and reproductive strategies make it an important species in marine ecosystems."
