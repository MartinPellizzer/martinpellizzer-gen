    "intro": "Avena latifolia, commonly known as broad-leaf oat, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its wide, flat leaves and panicle-like inflorescence that bears small, spikelet-based flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Avena latifolia is also valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
