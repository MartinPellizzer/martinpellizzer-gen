    "intro": "Asplenium trichomanes var. incisum, commonly known as the serrated maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern native to various regions in Asia and the Pacific. It is a small, delicate fern characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often serrated along the edges. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in small, round structures called sori. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, indoor environments."
