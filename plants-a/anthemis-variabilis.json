    "intro": "Anthemis variabilis, commonly known as the variable anthemis, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its yellow-orange flowers bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments."
