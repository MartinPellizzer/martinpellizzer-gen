    "intro": "Amaryllis \u00d7 acramanii, commonly known as the Acraman lily, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Amaryllis bellodonna and Amaryllis recurva. It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant produces large, fleshy bulbs that store nutrients, allowing it to thrive in seasonal climates. It typically blooms in late winter to early spring, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking early-flowering ornamental plants. The leaves are broad and strap-like, often forming a dense rosette around the base of the plant."
