    "intro": "Asplenium ahmarense, commonly known as the Ahmari's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered closely together. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rock crevices or forest floors. Its rhizomes are short and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself in rocky substrates. Asplenium ahmarense is native to parts of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in humid, temperate climates."
