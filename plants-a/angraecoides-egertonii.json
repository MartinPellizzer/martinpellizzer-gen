    "intro": "Angraecoides egertonii, commonly known as the Egerton's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to East Africa. It is a terrestrial herb with a short, fibrous root system and a single, erect stem that bears a single, showy inflorescence. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow with a distinctive, spurred lip that attracts pollinators such as moths. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
