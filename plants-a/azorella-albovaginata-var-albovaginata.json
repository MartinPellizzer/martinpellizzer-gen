    "intro": "Azorella albovaginata var. albovaginata, commonly known as the white-barked azorella, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form. The plant features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically covered in a thick layer of white, woolly hair, which helps to insulate it against cold and arid conditions. Azorella albovaginata var. albovaginata is well adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
