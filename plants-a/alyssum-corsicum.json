    "intro": "Alyssum corsicum, commonly known as Corsican alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in early spring. The plant has silvery-green foliage with a slightly woolly texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It is often cultivated as a ornamental plant in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ability to attract pollinators. Alyssum corsicum prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders."
