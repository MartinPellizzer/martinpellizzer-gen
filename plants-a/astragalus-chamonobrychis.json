    "intro": "Astragalus chamonobrychis, commonly known as the Alaskan milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as stream banks and wet meadows. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces showy, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to purple. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution in alpine and subalpine environments."
