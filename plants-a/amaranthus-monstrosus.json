    "intro": "Amaranthus monstrosus, commonly known as the \"cottonwood amaranth,\" is a striking annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, velvety, plum-colored bracts that form a showy, spiky crown, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental value. Amaranthus monstrosus thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardens."
