    "intro": "Avena pubescens f. straminea, commonly known as the yellow oatgrass, is a variant of the common oatgrass species. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in temperate regions, often found in meadows and along roadsides. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, each bearing small, yellowish flowers. This form is notable for its distinctive yellowish coloration, which sets it apart from the more typical green varieties of Avena pubescens."
