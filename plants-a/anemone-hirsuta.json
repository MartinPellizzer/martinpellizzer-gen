    "intro": "Anemone hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern hemisphere. It features a basal rosette of hairy, lobed leaves that help it retain moisture and withstand cold temperatures. The plant produces showy, white to pink flowers with numerous petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its fibrous root system allows it to anchor firmly in soil while absorbing nutrients efficiently."
