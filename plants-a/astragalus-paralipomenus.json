It is characterized by its erect stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Astragalus paralipomenus plays a role in nitrogen fixation and provides forage for wildlife and livestock."
