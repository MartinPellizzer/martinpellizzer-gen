    "intro": "Archangelica, commonly known as hogweed, is a tall biennial or perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its large, umbrella-like compound leaves and tall, branched stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered umbels, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its roots and leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though the plant is toxic and should be handled with care. The plant's name is believed to have originated from its supposed protective properties against the plague."
