    "intro": "Antennaria neglecta var. campestris, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern regions of North America. It features small, white flowers and hairy, lobed leaves that are adapted to thrive in dry, disturbed soils. The plant typically forms dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for ecological restoration projects."
