    "intro": "Andromeda baccata, commonly known as the sweetleaf or wintergreen, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in clusters, typically white or pale pink, which bloom in early spring. Its berries, which are red and toxic to humans, mature in late summer and are an important food source for birds. Andromeda baccata thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded woodland environments."
