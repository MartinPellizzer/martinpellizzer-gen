    "intro": "Anisophyllum inaequale, commonly known as the unequal-leaf plant, is a rare and distinctive member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, with leaves that are asymmetrically shaped and often deeply lobed. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Anisophyllum inaequale is known for its limited distribution and is often found in specific regions of the southeastern United States."
