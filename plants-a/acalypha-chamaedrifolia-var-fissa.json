    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha chamaedrifolia var. fissa is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in lowland tropical rainforests and secondary growth areas. This variant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. It is often seen growing along stream banks and in forest understories. The plant is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in tropical regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha chamaedrifolia var. fissa was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for use in landscaping and garden design. The plant's ability to thrive in both full sun and partial shade makes it a versatile choice for gardeners. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas where it can outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns about ecological impacts in non-native habitats."
