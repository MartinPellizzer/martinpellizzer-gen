    "intro": "Atriplex phyllostegia var. draconis, commonly known as dragon's tail, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short, stiff stalks. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
