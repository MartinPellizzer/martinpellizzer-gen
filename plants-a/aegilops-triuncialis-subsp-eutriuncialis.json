    "intro": "Aegilops triuncialis subsp. eutriuncialis, commonly known as the slender wild wheat, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields, where it can act as a weed. This subspecies is of interest to researchers due to its potential role in wheat evolution and genetic diversity."
