    "intro": "Alsine procera, commonly known as tall sandparsley, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant features small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Its leaves are usually basal, forming a rosette, and are covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. Alsine procera is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments."
