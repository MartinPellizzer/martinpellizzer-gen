    "intro": "Aphelandra tetragona, commonly known as the four-angled flame tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its striking, bright orange to red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant has opposite, elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy, with a slightly serrated edge. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by bright yellow fruits. Aphelandra tetragona thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
