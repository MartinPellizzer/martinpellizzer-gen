It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showing adaptations to drought and poor soil conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Austrostipa gibbosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife in its native range."
