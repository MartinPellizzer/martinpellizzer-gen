    "intro": "Adisca albicans, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, white, waxy flowers that resemble ghosts, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species.",
