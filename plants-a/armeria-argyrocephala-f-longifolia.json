It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and bright white to silver-colored flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant features basal rosettes of linear, silver-haired leaves, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. The subspecies f. longifolia is distinguished by its longer, more slender leaves compared to the typical form."
