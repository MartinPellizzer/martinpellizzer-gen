This species is found in the unique ecosystems of the island, particularly in the southern and southeastern regions. It thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soils. The plant is commonly associated with lowland rainforests and coastal areas. Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species within Madagascar.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrahamia sambiranensis was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. It thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil, making it suitable for cultivation in regions with high rainfall. This plant is often found growing near streams or in forest understories where it can receive adequate light without direct sun exposure. Its introduction has been noted in several parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. Due to its ornamental value, it has been cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections in these regions."
