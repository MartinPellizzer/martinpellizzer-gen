    "intro": "Arctium polyacanthum, commonly known as the greater burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a tall, hairy stem and large, heart-shaped leaves with rough textures. Its most distinctive feature is the spiny, bur-like fruit that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. The roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
