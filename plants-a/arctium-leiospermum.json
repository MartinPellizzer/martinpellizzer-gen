    "intro": "Arctium leiospermum, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by the development of spiny, bur-like fruits. Its roots are thick and fibrous, often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in meadows."
