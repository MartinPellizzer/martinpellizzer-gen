It is characterized by its broad, velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a deep red or purple underside. The plant produces striking spadices, which are inflorescences that resemble spikes, often in shades of red or yellow. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Anthurium orteganum is popular as a decorative plant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
