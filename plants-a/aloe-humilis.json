    "intro": "Aloe humilis, commonly known as the dwarf aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, narrow leaves that are typically green with a slight bluish tint. The plant produces small, yellow flowers on tall, branched stems during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Aloe humilis is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its compact size and ornamental appeal."
