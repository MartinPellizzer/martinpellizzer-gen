    "intro": "Alnus incana var. orbicularis, commonly known as the round-leaf alder, is a variant of the gray alder native to parts of North America. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its elliptical to orbicular leaves, which are often hairy beneath. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or wetlands. This species plays an important role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various wildlife species."
