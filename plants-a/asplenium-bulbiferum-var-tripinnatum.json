    "intro": "Asplenium bulbiferum var. tripinnatum, commonly known as the tripinnate spleenwort, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are tripinnate, meaning they are divided into three levels of smaller leaflets, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant is also notable for its ability to produce plantlets on the margins of its fronds, a feature that aids in its propagation."
