    "intro": "Astragalus criacanthus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant produces small, elliptical seeds enclosed in a pod-like fruit, which is typical of the Fabaceae (legume) family. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland ecosystems. Astragalus criacanthus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range."
