    "intro": "Angorkis dolichangis, commonly known as the long-stemmed orchid, is a rare and exotic flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and delicate, fragrant blooms. The plant typically produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Angorkis dolichangis thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
