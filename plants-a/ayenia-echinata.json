It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features dense, spiny bracts that protect its central flowers, which are typically yellow or orange in color. Ayenia echinata thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in grasslands and shrublands. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
