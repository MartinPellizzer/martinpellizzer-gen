    "intro": "Aeluropus brevifolius var. longifolius, commonly known as the long-leaved sandgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often longer than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate extreme drought conditions. This grass plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
