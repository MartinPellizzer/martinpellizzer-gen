    "intro": "Armatocereus godingianus subsp. brevispinus, commonly known as the short-spined night bloomer, is a cactus native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in short, pale spines. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and botanical collections."
