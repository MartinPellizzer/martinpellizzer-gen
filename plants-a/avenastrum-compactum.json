    "intro": "Avenastrum compactum, commonly known as the dwarf wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, compact growth with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are followed by narrow, cylindrical seed heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Avenastrum compactum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
