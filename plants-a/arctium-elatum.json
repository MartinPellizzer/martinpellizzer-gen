    "intro": "Arctium elatum, commonly known as the greater burdock, is a tall biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a robust stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of purple to pink flowers in its second year, followed by spiky, bur-like fruits that contain seeds. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The plant is well-known for its prickly seed heads, which can attach to clothing and animal fur, aiding in seed dispersal."
