    "intro": "Acacia gardneri, commonly known as the Gardner's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and bipinnate leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow to orange flower clusters, which are arranged in spherical or cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. Acacia gardneri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia gardneri is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the southern and western regions of the state. This plant typically grows in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and inland dune environments. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range. Acacia gardneri plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia gardneri was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It was brought in for its ornamental value due to its distinctive yellow flowers and ability to thrive in dry conditions. The plant has since spread into native habitats, often outcompeting local vegetation. It is considered an invasive species in some areas, posing a threat to native ecosystems. Proper management is necessary to control its spread and mitigate its impact on biodiversity."
