    "intro": "Asplenium granatense, commonly known as the granate spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant, typically found growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes and produces delicate, lanceolate leaves that are usually dark green with a leathery texture. Its spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori. Asplenium granatense is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable humid environments."
