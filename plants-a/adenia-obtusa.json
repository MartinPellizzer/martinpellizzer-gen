    "intro": "Adenia obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaved adenia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. These flowers are followed by orange or red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Adenia obtusa is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and rocky outcrops.",
