    "intro": "Acaena pinnatifida subsp. oligacantha, commonly known as the slender burr bush, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and dense, spiny bracts. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by spherical, prickly fruits. It thrives in coastal and lowland environments, often forming dense shrubs. The subspecies is distinguished by its reduced number of bracts compared to the typical form of A. pinnatifida.",

This subspecies grows in a variety of habitats, including coastal areas, rocky outcrops, and forest margins. It is commonly found in the Marlborough and Canterbury regions. The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate and diverse soil types of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena pinnatifida subsp. oligacantha was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the early European settlement and has since become naturalized in various regions. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in coastal areas and open habitats. It is considered a potential weed due to its ability to spread rapidly in certain environments. However, it is not widely invasive and is often found in limited distributions."
