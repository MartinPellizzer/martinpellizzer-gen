    "intro": "Acacia pruinosa, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems covered in a fine, whitish bloom that gives it a silvery appearance. The leaves are bipinnate, with numerous small, oval leaflets that are usually clustered in groups of three. Its yellow flowers, which appear in late winter to early spring, are produced in globular or cylindrical clusters. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance and a preference for well-drained soils.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia pruinosa is primarily native to New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria. It is commonly found in various habitats across these regions, including dry forests, woodlands, and rocky areas. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with sclerophyllous vegetation. It is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of southeastern Australia. Acacia pruinosa plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia pruinosa was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the northern and western parts of the country. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber and fuelwood. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its potential to invade native habitats. Despite this, it remains an important species in certain ecological and agricultural contexts."
