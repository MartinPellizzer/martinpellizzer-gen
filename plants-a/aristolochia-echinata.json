    "intro": "Aristolochia echinata, commonly known as the Brazilian pipevine, is a climbing vine native to South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, hollow, pipe-like flowers that are usually greenish-yellow with a strong, aromatic scent. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that contain the seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is also considered invasive in some areas."
