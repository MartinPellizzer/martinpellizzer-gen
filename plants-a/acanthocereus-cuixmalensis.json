It thrives in rocky soils and is often associated with desert scrub habitats. The plant is adapted to the harsh climate of the region. Its distribution is limited to specific areas within the southwestern part of Mexico.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthocereus cuixmalensis was mainly introduced to regions with arid or semi-arid climates, particularly in the southwestern United States and parts of Mexico. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for desert gardens and xeriscaping. This plant is valued for its ornamental appearance, featuring spiny stems and vibrant flowers. It has been cultivated for both its aesthetic appeal and its ability to withstand extreme temperatures. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems."
