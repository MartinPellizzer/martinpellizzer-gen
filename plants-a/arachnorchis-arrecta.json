    "intro": "Arachnorchis arrecta, commonly known as the erect spider-orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers with a distinctive, spider-like appearance. Arachnorchis arrecta is valued for its unique morphology and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
