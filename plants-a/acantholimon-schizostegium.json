    "intro": "Acantholimon schizostegium, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, arid environments. It produces a capsule fruit containing numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Acantholimon schizostegium is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.",

It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the eastern and central areas. This plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, adapting to the harsh climatic conditions of the region. It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is known for its hardy nature. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within Afghanistan, making it a unique and localized species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon schizostegium was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It thrives in regions with low humidity and moderate to high levels of sunlight. This plant is commonly found in coastal dunes, rocky outcrops, and disturbed sites. Its introduction has been documented in several parts of the Mediterranean and along the western coasts of North America. Due to its hardy nature, it has become established in some non-native habitats where it can outcompete native vegetation."
