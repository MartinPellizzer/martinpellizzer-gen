    "intro": "Aster alleghaniensis, commonly known as Allegheny aster, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flower heads that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded habitats such as stream banks and cedar glades. It has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces a single, terminal flower head composed of numerous tiny florets. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
