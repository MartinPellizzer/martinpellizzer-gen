    "intro": "Asplenium nanchuanense, commonly known as the Nanchuan spleenwort, is a rare fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the undersides of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
