    "intro": "Andropogon digitatus, commonly known as narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed areas, reaching heights of 1 to 3 meters. The plant has slender, often hairy leaves that are narrow and tapering, with a blue-green coloration. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-bearing branches, which produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Andropogon digitatus is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for wildlife."
