    "intro": "Artemisia arctica var. beringensis, commonly known as Beringian wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. This variety is notable for its aromatic properties and has been used traditionally by Indigenous peoples for medicinal and practical purposes."
