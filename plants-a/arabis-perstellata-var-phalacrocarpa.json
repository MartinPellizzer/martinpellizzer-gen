    "intro": "Arabis perstellata var. phalacrocarpa, commonly known as the sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and cliffs. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a compact, mat-forming growth habit. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
