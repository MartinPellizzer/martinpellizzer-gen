    "intro": "Alopecurus pratensis subsp. alpestris, commonly known as alpine meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Alopecurus pratensis subsp. alpestris plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals."
