    "intro": "Alnus rubra var. pinnatisecta, commonly known as the red alder, is a deciduous tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its finely pinnatisected leaves, which give it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in catkins, followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and moist forests. This variety is notable for its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important species in ecological restoration."
