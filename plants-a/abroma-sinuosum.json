    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abroma sinuosum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in coastal and mangrove environments, often growing in sandy or saline soils near the shoreline. It is also present in parts of India and Sri Lanka, where it is adapted to similar climatic conditions. Abroma sinuosum is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found in open woodlands, grasslands, and along roadsides.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abroma sinuosum was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping. It is commonly found in disturbed areas, including roadsides, wastelands, and agricultural fields. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, where it can spread rapidly due to its adaptability. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several non-native locations, sometimes becoming invasive. This distribution pattern highlights its potential ecological impact in new environments."
