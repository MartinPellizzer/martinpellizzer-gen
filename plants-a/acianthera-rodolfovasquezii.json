    "intro": "Acianthera rodolfovasquezii, commonly known as the V\u00e1squez orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to Ecuador. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within cloud forests, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its floral structure includes a single, showy bloom with intricate petal patterns, and it is often found in association with other epiphytic plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.",
