    "intro": "Anthemis rudolphiana var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf tansy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features wiry, branched stems that are often covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers arranged in compact clusters, typical of the Anthemis genus. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in a distinctive whitish or grayish bloom, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments."
