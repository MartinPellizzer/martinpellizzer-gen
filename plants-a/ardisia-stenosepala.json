    "intro": "Ardisia stenosepala, commonly known as the narrow-sepaled ardisia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer. Its fruit is a bright red berry, which is edible but often contains seeds that are dispersed by birds. Ardisia stenosepala is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
