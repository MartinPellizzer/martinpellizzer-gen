    "intro": "Artemisia minima, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a small shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, which contribute to its use in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
