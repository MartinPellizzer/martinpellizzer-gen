    "intro": "Albizia eggelingii, commonly known as the African mimosa, is a leguminous shrub native to sub-Saharan Africa. It features feathery, bipinnate leaves that close when touched, a characteristic shared with other members of the Mimosa genus. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits. Albizia eggelingii has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder for livestock."
