    "intro": "Aristolochia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable arrow vine, is a climbing herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, often heart-shaped leaves and its distinctive, hooded flowers that resemble a pipe or a horn. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically borne in clusters along the stems. Its fruit is a fleshy, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, dark seeds. The species is notable for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine, though it contains toxic compounds that require caution in handling."
