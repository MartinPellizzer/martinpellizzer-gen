    "intro": "Archangelica littoralis, commonly known as coastal angelica, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that can grow up to 50 cm in length, and its tall, branched flower stalks that bear small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant thrives in moist, saline environments, often found in coastal marshes and tidal zones. It produces a strong, aromatic odor due to the presence of volatile compounds such as monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. Archangelica littoralis is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of bioactive compounds."
