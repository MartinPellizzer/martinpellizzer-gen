    "intro": "Antennaria pseudoarenicola, commonly known as the sandhare, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, pale green to yellowish leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in compact inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xerophytic environments and it is often found in dune ecosystems."
