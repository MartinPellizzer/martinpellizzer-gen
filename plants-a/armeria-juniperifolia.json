    "intro": "Armeria juniperifolia, commonly known as the juniper-like thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has needle-like leaves that are gray-green in color, giving it a resemblance to juniper. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and full sun, making it well-suited for coastal gardens. Its hardy nature and ability to withstand salt spray make it a valuable plant in coastal restoration projects."
