    "intro": "Actinostemon cuneatus, commonly known as the African ice plant, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, triangular leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and can thrive in full sun with minimal water. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.",
