    "intro": "Aquilegia canadensis f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered Canadian columbine, is a cultivar of the native American columbine. It is characterized by its striking white petals and golden-yellow sepals, which contrast sharply with its dark green foliage. This perennial plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 3 feet and thrives in partial to full shade. Its flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soil and is often found in woodland habitats."
