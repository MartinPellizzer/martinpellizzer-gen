    "intro": "Amyema caudiciflora, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces delicate, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hidden beneath the stem. Amyema caudiciflora is a striking example of adapted flora in the Cape Floristic Region."
