    "intro": "Allium schoenoprasum var. scaberrimum, commonly known as rough chives, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spherical purple or pink flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. The plant produces bulbils along its flowering stems, which can be used for propagation. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its aromatic foliage is often used in culinary applications, though it has a more pungent flavor compared to common chives."
