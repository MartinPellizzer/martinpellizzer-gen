    "intro": "Artemisia koelreuteriana, commonly known as the silverleaf tarragon, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features silvery-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in compact clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or dry garden settings. Its aromatic leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb, though it is less commonly cultivated than other tarragon varieties."
