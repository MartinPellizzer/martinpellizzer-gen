It is characterized by its unique, spadix-shaped inflorescence surrounded by a hood-like spathe. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its foliage consists of heart-shaped leaves with a waxy texture, and the stems are distinctly green, giving it its common name. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
