    "intro": "Adenostemma viscosum var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved stickyweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a sticky, glandular substance. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its sticky foliage and hardy nature, it is often found in disturbed or dryland habitats.",
