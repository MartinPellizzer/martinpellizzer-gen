    "intro": "Avena \u00d7 altior, commonly known as the tall oat, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Avena sativa (common oat) and Avena fatua (wild oat). It is a tall, annual grass that can grow up to 2 meters in height, characterized by its slender, erect stems and long, narrow leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, two-lobed spikelets, which contain the characteristic oat grains. Avena \u00d7 altior is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural fields. Its botanical features make it an important species in the study of hybridization and grass evolution."
