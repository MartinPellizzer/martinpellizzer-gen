    "intro": "Actinidia arisanensis, commonly known as the Arisan kiwifruit, is a deciduous vine native to Taiwan. It belongs to the Actinidiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to common kiwifruit but are less widely cultivated. It thrives in temperate climates and is often grown for its ornamental value as well as its fruit. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat.",
