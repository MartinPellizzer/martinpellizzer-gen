    "intro": "Ajuga furcata, commonly known as sheep's sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common ground cover in its native habitats."
