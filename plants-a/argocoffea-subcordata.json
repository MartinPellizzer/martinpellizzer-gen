    "intro": "Argocoffea subcordata, commonly known as the dwarf coffee plant, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes other coffee species, and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy fruits containing seeds used for coffee production. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its caffeine-containing berries. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
