It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Avena dufourei is often found in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
