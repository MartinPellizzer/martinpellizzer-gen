    "intro": "Albizia caribaea, commonly known as the Carib bean tree, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It features compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets and produces yellow to orange pea-like flowers. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in tropical dry forests. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil through its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria. Albizia caribaea is also used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
