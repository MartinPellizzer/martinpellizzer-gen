    "intro": "Agave costaricana, commonly known as the Costa Rican agave, is a succulent plant native to Central America. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with spiny margins. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears small, white flowers. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its leaves. Agave costaricana is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance."
