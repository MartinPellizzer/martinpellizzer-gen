    "intro": "Artemisia caerulescens subsp. caerulescens, commonly known as blue artemisia, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silvery-blue foliage that emits a strong, camphor-like scent when crushed. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during the summer months. This species is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant in gardens due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
