    "intro": "Ajuga incisa f. rosea, commonly known as roseleaf ajuga, is a low-growing perennial ground cover plant native to Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green, often with a pinkish or reddish tinge. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens or shaded rockeries. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and extended blooming period."
