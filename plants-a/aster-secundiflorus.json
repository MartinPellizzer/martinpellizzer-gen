    "intro": "Aster secundiflorus, commonly known as the mountain aster, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at high elevations with cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture, while its flowers bloom in shades of blue to purple. Aster secundiflorus plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
