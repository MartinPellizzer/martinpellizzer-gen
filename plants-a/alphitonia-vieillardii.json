It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody pods containing flat, brown seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for ornamental planting in warm climates.
