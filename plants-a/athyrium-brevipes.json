    "intro": "Athyrium brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed lady fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its finely divided, delicate fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Athyrium brevipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance."
