    "intro": "Anacamptis pyramidalis subsp. cerigensis, commonly known as the Cerigons Orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the UK. It is characterized by its tall, erect flowering stems that bear dense clusters of pale purple to white flowers. The plant typically grows in damp, calcareous grasslands and is adapted to the specific environmental conditions of its habitat. It has lance-shaped leaves and a short, stout rhizome, which help it thrive in its niche. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
