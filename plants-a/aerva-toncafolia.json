    "intro": "Aerva toncafolia, commonly known as Indian nettle or velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Aerva toncafolia is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings. It has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
