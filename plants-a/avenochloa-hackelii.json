    "intro": "Avenochloa hackelii, commonly known as the African ricegrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f (clump-forming) growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Avenochloa hackelii is adapted to poor soil conditions and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and potential agricultural use."
