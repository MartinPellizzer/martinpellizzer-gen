    "intro": "Agropyron semicostatum var. ciliare, commonly known as the rough wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
