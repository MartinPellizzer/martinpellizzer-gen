    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abildgaardia pilosa is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa. It is found in the grassland and savanna regions of the country. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly seen in open habitats. It is particularly associated with the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces. Abildgaardia pilosa is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to the region's climate and soil conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abildgaardia pilosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in coastal and inland regions. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact."
