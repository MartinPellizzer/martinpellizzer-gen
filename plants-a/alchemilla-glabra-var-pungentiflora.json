    "intro": "Alchemilla glabra var. pungentiflora, commonly known as the spiked lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are rounded with toothed edges and a dense covering of fine, silver-white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers on slender, upright stems during the summer months. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shady habitats. It is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
