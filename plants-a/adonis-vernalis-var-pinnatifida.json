    "intro": "Adonis vernalis var. pinnatifida, commonly known as the spring adonis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, yellowish-orange flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, pinnatifid (bifurcated) leaves, which contribute to its botanical classification. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas.",
