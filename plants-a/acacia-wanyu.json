    "intro": "Acacia wanyu, commonly known as the red acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often thorned branches. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by flat, bean-like pods. Its leaves are bipinnately compound, consisting of numerous small leaflets. Acacia wanyu is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in soil stabilization and habitat provision for various wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia wanyu is primarily native to Western Australia. It is found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in the areas around the Fitzgerald River National Park and the Yanchidup area. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in coastal and inland regions with a Mediterranean climate. It is often associated with open woodlands and heathlands. Acacia wanyu is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in supporting native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia wanyu was mainly introduced to areas with semi-arid to arid climates, particularly in regions with well-drained soils. It is commonly found in savannas and woodland habitats across parts of Africa and the Middle East. This plant thrives in full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for reclamation of degraded lands. Its introduction has been part of ecological restoration efforts in regions facing desertification. However, its spread has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in non-native environments."
