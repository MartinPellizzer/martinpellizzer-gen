    "intro": "Acaciella cumingii, commonly known as the Cuming's acacia, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of northern South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features small, bipinnate leaves and produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It is adapted to survive in dry environments with minimal water availability. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various desert fauna.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaciella cumingii is primarily native to the Caribbean, specifically the islands of Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Bahamas. It is commonly found in coastal areas and dry forests, where it thrives in well-drained soils. This plant is adapted to the tropical and subtropical climates of these regions. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for local wildlife. Due to habitat loss and human activity, its distribution has become increasingly restricted.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaciella cumingii was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Queensland. This plant is often used for soil stabilization due to its deep root system and drought tolerance. It has also been introduced to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands for ornamental purposes. However, its spread is limited by its specific environmental requirements and lack of widespread cultivation."
