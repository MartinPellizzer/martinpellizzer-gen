    "intro": "Alsine fasciculata var. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular alsike clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields. The plant features prostrate or ascending stems that are often hairy, with small, clustered leaves. Its flowers are pink to purple in color, arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, kidney-shaped seeds. This variety is known for its glandular structures on the stems and leaves, which contribute to its distinctive appearance and ecological role."
