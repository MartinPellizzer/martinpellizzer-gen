    "intro": "Armeriastrum talagonicum, commonly known as the Talagon Island sandplant, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its coastal habitat. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the dry season. Its foliage consists of narrow, fleshy leaves that help conserve moisture. Armeriastrum talagonicum plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
