    "intro": "Acaena transitoria, commonly known as the New Zealand thistle, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, yellow flowers. The plant produces numerous achene fruits, which are typically covered in hooked bracts that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and coastal areas, and is often found in disturbed soils. Acaena transitoria plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various invertebrates and birds.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena transitoria is primarily native to New Zealand. It is commonly found in the southern regions of the country, including the South Island and parts of the North Island. This plant thrives in a variety of habitats, such as shrublands, grasslands, and rocky areas. It is often associated with coastal and inland environments where it forms part of the native vegetation. Acaena transitoria plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining ecosystem balance.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena transitoria was mainly introduced to New Zealand as a potential ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and its ability to thrive in various soil conditions. It was later found to be invasive, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant's spread has been particularly rapid in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest margins. Control efforts have focused on mechanical removal and the use of herbicides to prevent further spread. Despite its ecological impacts, it remains a challenge for land managers due to its resilience and adaptability."
