    "intro": "Alectorolophus stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a compact, upright cluster. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Alectorolophus stenophyllus thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an important component of tropical ecosystems and a subject of study in plant taxonomy."
