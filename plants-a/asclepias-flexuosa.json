    "intro": "Asclepias flexuosa, commonly known as the zigzag milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and pairs of opposite, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, bean-like seed pods. It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is known for its milky sap, which is toxic to many animals. Asclepias flexuosa serves as a host plant for the monarch butterfly, supporting its life cycle."
