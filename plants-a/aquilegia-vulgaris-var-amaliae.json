    "intro": "Aquilegia vulgaris var. amaliae, commonly known as the Amalia Peony or Amalia's Columbine, is a variant of the common columbine. It is characterized by its vibrant, spurred petals that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically arranged in a cluster of five. The plant produces clusters of bright, showy flowers that bloom in early to mid-summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its foliage consists of deeply lobed leaves that are dark green and provide a striking contrast to the colorful blooms."
