    "intro": "Apium maclovianum, commonly known as the Maclovian cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and dill, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbel-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pale yellow, bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight."
