    "intro": "Amyris kataf, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood, which is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant has simple, opposite leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry forest and woodland habitats. Due to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
