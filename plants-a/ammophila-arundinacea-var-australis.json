    "intro": "Ammophila arundinacea var. australis, commonly known as the Australian beach grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal areas of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous root system that helps stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion. The plant produces tall, slender stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It flowers with spikelets that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. This variety is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and strong winds."
