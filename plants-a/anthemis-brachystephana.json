    "intro": "Anthemis brachystephana, commonly known as the narrow-stephane everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a flat-topped cluster, and it is known for its aromatic, often fragrant foliage. Anthemis brachystephana is a low-growing perennial that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its historical use in traditional medicine has also been noted, though its primary botanical interest lies in its floral structure and adaptability to arid environments."
