    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria f. praepropera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bladder campion, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This subspecies is typically found in dry, calcareous soils across Europe and parts of western Asia. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
