    "intro": "Asplenium graminoides, commonly known as the grass fern, is a small evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has slender, grass-like fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of white or gray spores. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium graminoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its delicate appearance."
