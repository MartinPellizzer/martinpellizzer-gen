    "intro": "Axonopus kleinii, commonly known as the dwarf carpetgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense mat, often found in wet or moist soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets. It is often used in landscaping for its ability to suppress weeds and its aesthetic appeal in shaded areas. Axonopus kleinii is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
