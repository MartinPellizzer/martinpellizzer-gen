    "intro": "Agropyron vernicosum, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky soils, and disturbed areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in poor soils and its tolerance to drought conditions. Agropyron vernicosum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
