    "intro": "Alsine tenuifolia var. subtilis, commonly known as slender alsike, is a low-growing annual herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various garden conditions. Due to its delicate appearance and short life cycle, it is often used in wildflower gardens or as a ground cover."
