    "intro": "Athrixia heterophylla subsp. heterophylla, commonly known as the common star hair, is a small, mat-forming perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and its distinctive, star-shaped hairs on the leaves and stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal or rocky habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
