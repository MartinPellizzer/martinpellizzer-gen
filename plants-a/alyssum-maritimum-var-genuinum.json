    "intro": "Alyssum maritimum var. genuinum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and clusters of small, often blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and silver-gray, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Alyssum maritimum var. genuinum is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize sandy soils."
