    "intro": "Alcantarea heloisae, commonly known as the Heloise's Alcantara, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its large, waxy, and brightly colored rosette of leaves that can range from green to red or purple. The plant produces striking inflorescences with showy, long-lasting flowers that are typically yellow or orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Alcantarea heloisae is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance once established."
