    "intro": "Aquilegia einseleana var. thalictrifolia, commonly known as the Thalictrifolia columbine, is a rare and striking member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its unique, spurred petals that resemble those of the genus Thalictrum, giving it its hybrid name. Native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Carpathians in Romania, this plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. It produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
