    "intro": "Astragalus laxmannii subsp. viciifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves with a vicia-like leaflet arrangement. The plant produces small, yellow to reddish-purple flowers clustered in racemes, followed by pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments. Due to its drought tolerance and nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
