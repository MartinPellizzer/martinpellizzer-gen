    "intro": "Acer campestre subsp. marsicum, commonly known as the Marsic maple, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which are typically green on top and pale underneath, turning vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile choice for landscaping. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in gardens and parks.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer campestre subsp. marsicum is primarily native to Hungary, NW. Balkan Pen., and Romania. This subspecies is found in regions characterized by temperate climates and diverse forested landscapes. It typically grows in woodland areas, along forest edges, and in open habitats with well-drained soils. The plant is well adapted to the environmental conditions of these regions, including variations in temperature and precipitation. Its distribution reflects its ecological preferences and historical range expansion across Central and Eastern Europe.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer campestre subsp. marsicum was mainly introduced to Europe, particularly in the Mediterranean region, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive autumn foliage and compact growth habit. It has been widely cultivated in gardens and urban landscapes for its aesthetic value. Despite its ornamental appeal, it has shown some invasive tendencies in certain areas, outcompeting native species in local ecosystems. Its introduction has led to concerns about its ecological impact, especially in regions with similar environmental conditions to its native habitat. However, it remains a popular choice for landscaping due to its hardiness and adaptability."
