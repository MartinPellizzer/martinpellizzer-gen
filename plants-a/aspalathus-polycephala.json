    "intro": "Aspalathus polycephala, commonly known as rooibos, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, bushy growth and leathery, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Rooibos is notable for its unique ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its resistance to drought. Its botanical significance is further highlighted by its role in traditional South African medicine and its use in the production of a popular herbal tea."
