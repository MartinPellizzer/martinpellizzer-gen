    "intro": "Alisma plantago-aquatica var. lanceolatum, commonly known as narrow-leaved water plantain, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetland habitats. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that emerge from the water surface, often in clusters. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as marshes and ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, contributing to wetland ecosystem stability."
