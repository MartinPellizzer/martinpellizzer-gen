    "intro": "Alopecurus elatior, commonly known as silver hair vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive silvery hue on the underside, contributing to its common name. Alopecurus elatior is generally a short-lived perennial, though it can persist for several years under favorable conditions."
