    "intro": "Agrostis oreades, commonly known as mountain browntop, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in rocky, alpine, or woodland environments, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or blue on the underside. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis oreades is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
