    "intro": "Axia, commonly known as the desert willow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the genus *Chilopsis* within the family Bignoniaceae, characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that bloom in spring and summer. The plant has slender, woody stems and heart-shaped leaves that are adapted to conserve water in dry environments. Its flowers range in color from pink to orange and are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds and bees. Axia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
