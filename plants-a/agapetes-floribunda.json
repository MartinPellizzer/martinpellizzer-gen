    "intro": "Agapetes floribunda, commonly known as the clustered silverton, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are dark green, glossy, and often covered in a fine layer of silvery hair, contributing to its common name. Agapetes floribunda is adapted to cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests and alpine meadows."
