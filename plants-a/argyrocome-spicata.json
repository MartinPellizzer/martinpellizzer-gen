It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spicate inflorescences that bear tiny white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental appearance and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
