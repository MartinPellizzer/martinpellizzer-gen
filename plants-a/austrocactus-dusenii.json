It is a small, columnar cactus with a distinctive ribbed structure and spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically clustered at the top of the stem. It has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its thick, water-storing stems and reduced leaf surface. Austrocactus dusenii is a rare and protected species, highlighting its ecological significance in its native habitat."
