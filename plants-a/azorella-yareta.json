    "intro": "Azorella yareta, commonly known as the Andean rock cress, is a hardy plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, cushion-like growth form. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is well adapted to harsh, cold environments and can survive in nutrient-poor soils. Azorella yareta plays an important role in stabilizing rocky slopes and is a symbol of resilience in alpine ecosystems."
