    "intro": "Aegilops ovata var. quinquearistata, commonly known as the five-awned wild oat, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and long, narrow leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces spikelets that bear five awns, giving it its common name. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an annual or biennial plant. Botanically, it is closely related to other species in the Aegilops genus, which are important in the study of wheat genetics."
