    "intro": "Agropyron littorale var. obtusiflorum, commonly known as the coastal brome, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, obtuse-flowered spikelets. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments or along shorelines. Agropyron littorale var. obtusiflorum plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion."
