    "intro": "Aconitum villosum var. rectiusculum, commonly known as the woolly monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features showy, hooded blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has a tall, unbranched stem covered in soft, white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed segments that are also hairy. This variant is closely related to other Aconitum species and is valued in gardens for its ornamental value despite its toxic properties.",
