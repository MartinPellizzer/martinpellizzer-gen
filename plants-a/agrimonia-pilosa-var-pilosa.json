    "intro": "Agrimonia pilosa var. pilosa, commonly known as stiff agrimony, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branching stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are dry, capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. Agrimonia pilosa var. pilosa is often found in dry meadows, grasslands, and along woodland edges."
