    "intro": "Aspalathus rubens, commonly known as rooibos, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pink or red in color. The plant produces small, hard pods that contain the seeds, which are harvested and processed into the popular herbal tea. Aspalathus rubens thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat. Its unique botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and commercial contexts."
