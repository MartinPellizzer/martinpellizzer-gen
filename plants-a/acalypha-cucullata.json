    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha cucullata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is also found in parts of tropical Africa, including Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forest understories or along stream banks. It is commonly found in lowland and montane regions, preferring humid climates with well-drained soil. Acalypha cucullata is known for its attractive foliage and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha cucullata was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species. It was likely introduced through human activity, such as accidental transport on ships or intentional planting for ornamental purposes. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and can outcompete native vegetation, leading to ecological concerns. It is commonly found in coastal regions and lowland forests. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it poses a significant challenge for conservation efforts in the Hawaiian ecosystem."
