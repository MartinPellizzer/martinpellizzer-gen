    "intro": "Alchemilla pubescens var. adpressepilosa, commonly known as the woolly lady\u2019s mantle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe. It features a dense rosette of silver-gray, fuzzy leaves that are covered in fine pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in loose panicles. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to retain moisture."
