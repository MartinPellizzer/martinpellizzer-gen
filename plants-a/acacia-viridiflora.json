    "intro": "Acacia viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are composed of numerous small leaflets arranged in a feather-like pattern. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical or cylindrical heads, which are highly attractive to pollinators. Acacia viridiflora is often found in open woodlands and savannas, thriving in well-drained soils. It is also valued for its hard, durable wood and has been used in traditional crafts and construction.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia viridiflora is primarily native to eastern and southern Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Malawi, and Mozambique. It thrives in savanna and woodland habitats, often found in areas with well-drained soils. This species is commonly associated with dry to semi-arid regions and can tolerate a range of environmental conditions. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Acacia viridiflora is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia viridiflora was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the northern and western parts of the country. This plant is often used for soil stabilization due to its deep root system and ability to fix nitrogen. It has also been introduced to parts of Southeast Asia and the Middle East as an ornamental and for its hardy nature. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems."
