It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium pellucidum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
