    "intro": "Agrostis vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous bentgrass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is a low-growing perennial grass that typically forms dense mats on moist, often acidic soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, tufted shoots and small, spike-like inflorescences. One of its notable features is its ability to produce viviparous seeds, which germinate while still attached to the parent plant. This unique reproductive strategy allows it to colonize disturbed or wetland habitats efficiently."
