    "intro": "Aristolochia meridionaliana, commonly known as the southern pipevine, is a climbing vine native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-white with a strong, aromatic scent. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by flies, which are attracted to the odor resembling decaying meat. The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals, making it a subject of both botanical interest and caution."
