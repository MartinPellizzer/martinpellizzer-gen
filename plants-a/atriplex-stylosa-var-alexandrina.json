    "intro": "Atriplex stylosa var. alexandrina, commonly known as coastal saltbush, is a shrub native to coastal regions of Australia. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to tolerate saline and arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion. This variety is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardiness and ecological benefits."
