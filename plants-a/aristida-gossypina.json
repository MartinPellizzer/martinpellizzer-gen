    "intro": "Aristida gossypina, commonly known as silky grass or woolly beardgrass, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Aristida gossypina is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
