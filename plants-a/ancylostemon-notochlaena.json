    "intro": "Ancylostemon notochlaena, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and pinnately compound leaves that are narrow and linear. The plant produces large, showy cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
