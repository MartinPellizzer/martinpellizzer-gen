    "intro": "Aralia quinquefolia var. repens, commonly known as creeping aralia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features a low-growing habit with rhizomatous stems that allow it to spread across the ground. The plant produces compound leaves with five to seven leaflets, which are typically lobed and have a delicate, fern-like appearance. Small, greenish-white flowers are borne in umbrella-like clusters, followed by berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
