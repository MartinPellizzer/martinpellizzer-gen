    "intro": "Aspidium punctulatum, commonly known as the spotted shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with small, scattered dots or punctuations, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor the plant while spreading new growth. Aspidium punctulatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often used in shaded garden settings."
