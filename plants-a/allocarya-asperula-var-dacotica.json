    "intro": "Allocarya asperula var. dacotica, commonly known as the roughleaf lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its dense, crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to rock surfaces, often found in dry, shaded environments. The plant exhibits a pale to dark gray or brown coloration, with a rough, uneven texture that gives it its common name. It is typically found in temperate regions, growing on soil, bark, or stone. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a relatively rare and localized species."
