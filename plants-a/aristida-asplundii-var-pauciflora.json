    "intro": "Aristida asplundii var. pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered threeawn, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear few flowers, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces lightweight seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
