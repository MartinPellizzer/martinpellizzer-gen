    "intro": "Astragalus ghashghaicus, commonly known as the Persian milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of Iran and Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant produces pods containing several small, rounded seeds, which are adapted for dispersal in dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xerophytic habitats. The species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in semi-arid ecosystems."
