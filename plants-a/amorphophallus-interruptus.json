It is characterized by its large, arrowhead-shaped leaves and a stout, underground tuber that stores nutrients. The plant typically grows in wet, swampy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowering stems can reach several meters in height, producing large, white or violet-colored flowers. The species is notable for its rapid growth and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
