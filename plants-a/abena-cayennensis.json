    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abena cayennensis is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly the Amazon Basin and surrounding areas. It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. This plant thrives in humid, lowland environments with rich, well-drained soil. It is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. Its distribution is closely linked to the ecological conditions of the Amazonian rainforest ecosystem.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abena cayennensis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with warm, humid climates. It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico, where it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. This plant is often associated with human activity, as it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value or used in traditional medicine. Its introduction has led to its establishment in various ecological niches, sometimes competing with native flora. Due to its adaptability, it has become a common sight in both natural and agricultural landscapes in these regions."
