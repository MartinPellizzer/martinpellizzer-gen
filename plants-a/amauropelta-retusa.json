    "intro": "Amauropelta retusa, commonly known as the smooth fringed fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are usually divided into four parts, giving it a delicate, lily-like appearance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its reproductive structures, including small, yellowish flowers, are typically borne on short stalks above the water surface. Amauropelta retusa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates."
