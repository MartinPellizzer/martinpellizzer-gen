    "intro": "Avenula cincinnata, commonly known as the slender oatgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Avenula cincinnata typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological systems supporting various insect and bird species."
