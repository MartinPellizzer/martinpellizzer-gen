It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Native to tropical regions of South America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation in humid climates."
