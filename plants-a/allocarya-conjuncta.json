    "intro": "Allocarya conjuncta, commonly known as the clustered lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in temperate and boreal forest environments. It forms a dense, crust-like growth on tree bark, stones, and soil surfaces, often in shaded, moist habitats. The thallus is typically green to yellowish in color, with a leathery texture that allows it to retain moisture. It consists of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungus, which provides the plant with nutrients through photosynthesis. Allocarya conjuncta is often used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants."
