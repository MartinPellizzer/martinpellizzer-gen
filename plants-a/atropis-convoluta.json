    "intro": "Atropis convoluta, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
