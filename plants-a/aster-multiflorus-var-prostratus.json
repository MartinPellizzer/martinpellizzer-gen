    "intro": "Aster multiflorus var. prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate aster, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of blue to purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
