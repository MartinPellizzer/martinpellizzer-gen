    "intro": "Avenastrum pubescens, commonly known as the hairy wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Avenastrum pubescens is adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry, sandy soils. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
