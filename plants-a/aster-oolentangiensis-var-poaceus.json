It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy blue to purple flower heads in the late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. Its flowers are composite, consisting of ray florets and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. It serves as a valuable nectar source for pollinators and is often found in conservation areas."
