    "intro": "Agrostis obliqua, commonly known as bent grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along streambanks, and in open woodlands. The plant has slender, tufted clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Agrostis obliqua is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in turfgrass mixes for its fine texture and dense growth habit."
