    "intro": "Abronia villosa var. villosa, commonly known as the woolly bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of small, blue to violet flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique texture and color, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. The species is also noted for its ability to tolerate drought conditions once established.",

This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these states. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with desert environments. The species is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range. It is an important component of the local flora in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abronia villosa var. villosa was mainly introduced to coastal dunes and sandy soils along the Pacific coast of North America. It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. This plant is often associated with maritime environments and can tolerate salt spray and wind. Its introduction has been documented in several states including California, Oregon, and Washington. It is considered a non-native species in these regions, often spreading along disturbed coastal habitats."
