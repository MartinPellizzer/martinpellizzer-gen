    "intro": "Aaronsohnia factorovskyi, commonly known as the Factorovsky's Aaronsohnia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, temperate climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Aaronsohnia factorovskyi is primarily native to the Russian Far East, specifically the Primorsky Krai region. It is found in the mountainous areas of the Sikhote-Alin mountain range. This plant grows in humid, cool climates at high elevations. It is typically found in coniferous and mixed forests. Its distribution is limited and it is considered a rare species in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Aaronsohnia factorovskyi was mainly introduced to the Greater Mekong region, particularly in countries like Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. It was likely introduced through human activities such as land conversion and infrastructure development. This plant has established populations in disturbed habitats, including roadsides and agricultural areas. Its spread is facilitated by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its rapid growth rate. However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied."
