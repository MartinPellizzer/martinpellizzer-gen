    "intro": "Avena cinerea, commonly known as hoary avena, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its grayish-blue foliage, which is covered in fine, silky hairs that give it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet cluster with small, spike-like flowers. Avena cinerea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
