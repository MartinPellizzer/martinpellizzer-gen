    "intro": "Aquilegia vulgaris proles mollis, commonly known as the soft-fruited columbine, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features showy, spurred flowers in shades of red, pink, and purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has palmate leaves with deeply cut lobes, and its stems are typically hairy. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural spread in suitable habitats."
