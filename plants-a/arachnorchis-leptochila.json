    "intro": "Arachnorchis leptochila, commonly known as the slender-leaf spider-orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the eastern coast of Australia. It typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant features long, narrow leaves and produces delicate, spider-like flowers in shades of white and pale green. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence and specialized root system adapted for nutrient absorption from its substrate. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
