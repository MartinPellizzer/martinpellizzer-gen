    "intro": "Adiantum sulphureum, commonly known as the golden maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that display a striking golden hue, particularly along the margins. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil to flourish. Its fronds are bi-lobed and often curl at the tips, giving it a distinctive appearance. Adiantum sulphureum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.",
