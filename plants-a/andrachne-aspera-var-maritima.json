    "intro": "Andrachne aspera var. maritima, commonly known as sea sandmat, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a low-growing perennial herb with dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its succulent leaves are adapted to withstand salt spray and sandy soils, making it well-suited to coastal habitats. This variety is often found in dunes and rocky shores, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion."
