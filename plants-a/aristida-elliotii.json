    "intro": "Aristida elliotii, commonly known as Elliot's threeawn, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like clusters of bristly flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and covered with fine hairs, and the inflorescence consists of three to five spikelets. Aristida elliotii is often used in native plant landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
