The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. It typically grows to a height of 10-15 meters and prefers well-drained soils in full sun. Acer lingii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its seasonal foliage changes.",
