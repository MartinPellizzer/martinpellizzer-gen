    "intro": "Armeria macloviana, commonly known as the sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a member of the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of pink or white flowers, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. Armeria macloviana is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
