    "intro": "Asplenium harmanii, commonly known as the Harman's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in moist, shaded environments, often in temperate regions. The plant has finely divided, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorangs on the underside of its fronds. Asplenium harmanii is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
