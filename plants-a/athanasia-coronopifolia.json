    "intro": "Athanasia coronopifolia, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Andes, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in a range of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its flowers typically open in the morning and close at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Athanasia coronopifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its beauty."
