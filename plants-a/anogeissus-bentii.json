    "intro": "Anogeissus bentii, commonly known as the Indian sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to India and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant has simple, opposite, ovate leaves that are usually leathery in texture. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by small, round, woody fruits containing smooth, black seeds. This species is often cultivated for its timber and essential oils, which are used in perfumery and traditional medicine."
