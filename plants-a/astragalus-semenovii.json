    "intro": "Astragalus semenovii, commonly known as the Semenov's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by pods that contain several seeds. It is typically found in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
