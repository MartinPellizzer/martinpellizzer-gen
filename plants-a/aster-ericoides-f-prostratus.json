    "intro": "Aster ericoides f. prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate heath aster, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features small, clustered blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or heathlands. This subspecies is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, which helps it anchor to the ground and conserve moisture."
