    "intro": "Aechmea colombiana var. laxa, commonly known as the Colombian pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the Andes regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its rosette of long, narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red bracts that surround small, white flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and unique appearance."
