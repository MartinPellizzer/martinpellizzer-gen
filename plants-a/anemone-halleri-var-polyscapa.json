    "intro": "Anemone halleri var. polyscapa, commonly known as the alpine anemone, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white, showy flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas."
