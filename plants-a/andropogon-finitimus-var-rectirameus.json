    "intro": "Andropogon finitimus var. rectirameus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of wetland health."
