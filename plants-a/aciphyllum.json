    "intro": "Aciphyllum, commonly known as the spurge or sea spurge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, often fleshy leaves and stems, which help it store water in arid environments. The plants typically have small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia. Aciphyllum species are native to various regions, including parts of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. They are often found in coastal areas or sandy soils, adapting to harsh, saline conditions."
