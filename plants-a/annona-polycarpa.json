    "intro": "Annona polycarpa, commonly known as the giant soursop or custard apple, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a large, spiny fruit that turns from green to yellow as it matures. The fruit's pulp is creamy and sweet, with a texture similar to custard, and it contains numerous black seeds. Annona polycarpa is valued for its ornamental value and its edible fruit, which is rich in nutrients and has a unique flavor."
