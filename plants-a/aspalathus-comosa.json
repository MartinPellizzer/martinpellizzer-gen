    "intro": "Aspalathus comosa, commonly known as the Cape daisy, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and its clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern around the stems. It is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils. Aspalathus comosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
