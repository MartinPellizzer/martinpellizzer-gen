    "intro": "Arthrostylis aphylla, commonly known as the leafless spider orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with the plant relying solely on its flowering stems for photosynthesis. The plant produces intricate, spider-like flowers that are typically white or pale green, with a unique structure that aids in pollination. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
