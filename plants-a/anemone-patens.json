    "intro": "Anemone patens, commonly known as the \"buttercup\" or \"windflower,\" is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern hemisphere. It features showy, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has a short, stout stem with palmate leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs. Its root system consists of a rhizome that helps it survive harsh winter conditions. Anemone patens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
