    "intro": "[WRONG START] Asteilia hastata, commonly known as the silver fern, is a striking evergreen plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its unique, feathery foliage that resembles a fern. The plant features tall, upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a silvery, waxy coating. Astelia hastata thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to produce small, fragrant white flowers in the spring."
