    "intro": "Asimitellaria amamiana, commonly known as the Amami island bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and rocky areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are slender and often branched. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
