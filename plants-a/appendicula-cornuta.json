    "intro": "Appendicula cornuta, commonly known as the horned appendicula, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its unique feature is the presence of horn-like appendages on its stems, which give it its common name. Appendicula cornuta is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, harsh environments."
