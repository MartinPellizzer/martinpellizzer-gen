    "intro": "Arenaria papillosa, commonly known as the silky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are fleshy and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Arenaria papillosa plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native ecosystems and is adapted to withstand extreme cold and strong winds."
