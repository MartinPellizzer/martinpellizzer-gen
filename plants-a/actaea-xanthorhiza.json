The plant produces showy, white to cream-colored flowers in late summer, which are clustered in an umbel at the top of the stem. Its roots are known for their toxic properties and have been used historically in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.",
