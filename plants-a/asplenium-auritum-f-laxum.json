    "intro": "Asplenium auritum f. laxum, commonly known as the loose-leaf maidenhair fern, is a varietal form of the common maidenhair fern. It is characterized by its slender, gracefully arching fronds that are less densely packed than the typical species. The leaves are dark green, with a slightly serrated margin and a distinctive, delicate appearance. This fern prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
