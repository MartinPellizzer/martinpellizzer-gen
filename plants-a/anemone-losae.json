    "intro": "Anemone losae, commonly known as the Alpine anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features a short, stout stem with basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are white with pinkish veins, forming a single bloom at the top of the stem. Anemone losae is known for its resilience to harsh climates and is often found at elevations above 1,500 meters."
