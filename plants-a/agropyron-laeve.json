    "intro": "Agropyron laeve, commonly known as the smooth wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, flat leaves that are typically smooth to the touch. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Agropyron laeve is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields. It is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
