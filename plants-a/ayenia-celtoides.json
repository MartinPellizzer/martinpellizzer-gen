    "intro": "Ayenia celtoides, commonly known as the white sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, sandy soils. The plant features slender, branched stems and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Ayenia celtoides is adapted to full sun and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as sandy plains and rocky soils."
