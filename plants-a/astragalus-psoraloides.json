    "intro": "Astragalus psoraloides, commonly known as the yellow milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish to greenish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, legume-like pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Astragalus psoraloides is also noted for its medicinal properties, traditionally used in herbal remedies."
