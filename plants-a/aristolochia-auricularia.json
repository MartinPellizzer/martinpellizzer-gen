    "intro": "Aristolochia auricularia, commonly known as the hooded Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, hood-shaped flowers that resemble a pipe, with a deep purple to brown coloration. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often pubescent, and it produces small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The species is noted for its complex floral structure and its role in supporting specific pollinators."
