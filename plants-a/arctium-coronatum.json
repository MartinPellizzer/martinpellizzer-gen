    "intro": "Arctium coronatum, commonly known as the crowned burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant produces distinctive, spiny burs that encase its seeds, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and have a rough, serrated edge. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges."
