    "intro": "Arctostaphylos nummularia, commonly known as bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and leathery, oval-shaped leaves that remain green throughout the year. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges, rocky slopes, and open heathlands. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and erosion control in landscaping."
