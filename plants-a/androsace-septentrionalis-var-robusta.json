    "intro": "Androsace septentrionalis var. robusta, commonly known as the northern alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of northern Europe. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features a low-growing rosette of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its flowers are bell-shaped, usually pink to purple, and are borne on slender stems above the foliage. This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and ability to withstand harsh, cold climates."
