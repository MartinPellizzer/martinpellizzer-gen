    "intro": "Arctostaphylos intricata, commonly known as the Sierra manzanita, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and red-barked stems, which provide structural interest throughout the year. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for native plant gardens."
