    "intro": "Azorella monteroi, commonly known as the Andean rock cress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, and its leaves are usually covered in a thick layer of woolly hairs. Azorella monteroi is adapted to harsh, cold environments and is often found growing on rocky slopes and in alpine tundra. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
