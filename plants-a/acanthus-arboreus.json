    "intro": "Acanthus arboreus, commonly known as the tree acanthus, is a striking plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, woody stems that can reach heights of up to 6 meters. The plant features large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, silvery hairs. Its showy, spiny flower clusters appear in late summer and are composed of small, pale blue to purple flowers. Acanthus arboreus is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and historical association with classical architecture.",

This plant thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. It is commonly found in rocky and coastal habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a notable species in Yemen's flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus arboreus was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region for ornamental purposes due to its striking foliage and floral display. It has since been cultivated in gardens and landscaped areas across Europe, North Africa, and parts of the Middle East. The plant is valued for its ability to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun conditions. However, in some regions, it has become naturalized and is considered a potential invasive species. Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on local ecosystems and native plant communities."
