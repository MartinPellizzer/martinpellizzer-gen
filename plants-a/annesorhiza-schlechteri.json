    "intro": "Annesorhiza schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Liliaceae and is characterized by its striking white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
