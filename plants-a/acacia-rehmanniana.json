    "intro": "Acacia rehmanniana, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and feathery, bipinnate leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in spring, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and sandy environments. Acacia rehmanniana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia rehmanniana is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with well-drained soils. This plant thrives in open habitats such as grasslands, savannas, and forest edges. It is often associated with disturbed sites and can be found along roadsides and in agricultural areas. Acacia rehmanniana plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia rehmanniana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in tropical climates. It was also introduced to parts of Southeast Asia and the Caribbean for similar reasons. However, its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in some regions. The plant is now considered a weed in several areas where it has spread beyond cultivation. Its distribution is largely limited to regions with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils."
