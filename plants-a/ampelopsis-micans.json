    "intro": "Ampelopsis micans, commonly known as the silverleaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It features compound leaves with a distinctive silvery underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in late summer, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often used in ornamental landscaping. Its vigorous growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover."
