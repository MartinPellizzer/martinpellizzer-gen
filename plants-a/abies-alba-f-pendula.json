    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies alba f. pendula is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe, including parts of the Carpathian Mountains and the Alps. This unique form of the silver fir is known for its weeping growth habit, which distinguishes it from the typical upright form of Abies alba. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils, often found in mixed forests at higher elevations. The plant's distribution is limited to specific areas where its ecological requirements are met. Due to its restricted range and unique morphology, it is considered a rare and localized variant within the broader Abies alba species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies alba f. pendula was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its unique weeping form and aesthetic appeal. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and parks for its visual interest and ability to thrive in temperate climates. This cultivar is often used as a specimen plant or in mixed borders to add texture and height to the landscape. While it is not native to the region where it is introduced, it has become a popular choice for its adaptability and ornamental value. However, its introduction may have ecological implications if it spreads beyond cultivated areas."
