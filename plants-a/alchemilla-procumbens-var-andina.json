    "intro": "Alchemilla procumbens var. andina, commonly known as the Andean lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Andes Mountains. It features dense, silver-gray foliage that is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for shady garden beds. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in cooler climates."
