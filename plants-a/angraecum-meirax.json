    "intro": "Angraecum meirax, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom at night. The plant produces pendulous, white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive star-like shape, which are highly specialized for pollination by moths. Angraecum meirax thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in greenhouses to ensure its survival."
