    "intro": "Aphelandra cuscoensis, commonly known as the Cusco torch or sacred torch, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, resembling torches, which is reflected in its common name. These flowers are typically borne on long, slender inflorescences and bloom during the warmer months. Aphelandra cuscoensis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique foliage and showy blooms."
