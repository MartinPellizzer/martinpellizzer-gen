    "intro": "Adiantum subsulphureum, commonly known as the sulfur shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered with a waxy, sulfur-yellow coating, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous small, clustered sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Adiantum subsulphureum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light.",
