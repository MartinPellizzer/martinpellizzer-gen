    "intro": "Astracantha leucoptila, commonly known as the white-winged milkweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its milky sap is toxic and contains cardiac glycosides, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Astracantha leucoptila is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks, thriving in well-drained soils."
