    "intro": "Achillea gerberi var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved yarrow, is a perennial herb native to South America. It features slender, upright stems and finely divided, gray-green leaves that are lance-shaped and aromatic. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in flat-topped clusters, which bloom from late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or borders. Its historical use in traditional medicine is attributed to its aromatic and anti-inflammatory properties.",
