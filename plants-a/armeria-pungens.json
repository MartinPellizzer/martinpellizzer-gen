    "intro": "Armeria pungens, commonly known as sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of silver-gray foliage. The plant produces clusters of pink or white flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and coastal winds. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often used in coastal landscaping and as a ground cover."
