    "intro": "Asyneuma lobelioides f. glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth asyneuma, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in woodland areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered with a fine layer of hair, though the 'glaberrima' form is distinguished by its smoother, hairless surface. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
