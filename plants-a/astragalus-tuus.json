It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is known for its deep root system, which allows it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. It produces pods that contain several small, edible seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine.
