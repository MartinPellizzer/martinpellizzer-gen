    "intro": "Apodanthes mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a member of the Goodeniaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in dry, hot environments. It has narrow, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss, and its flowers bloom during the warmer months. Apodanthes mexicana is often found in xerophytic communities and is valued for its ornamental appeal in drought-tolerant gardens."
