    "intro": "Astragalus bodinii var. yukonis, commonly known as the Yukon milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and its root system is extensive, adapted to survive in dry, rocky soils. It is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife. This species is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
