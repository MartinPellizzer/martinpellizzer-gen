    "intro": "Astragalus pseudotomentellus, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its hairy, often silver-gray foliage and produces small, yellowish to brownish pea-like flowers. Native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, this plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. The plant's root system is deep and drought-tolerant, allowing it to thrive in harsh environmental conditions. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
