    "intro": "Alchemilla jamesonii, commonly known as Jameson's lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features spoon-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy secretions. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in late spring to early summer, and it is well adapted to rocky and arid environments. Alchemilla jamesonii is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
