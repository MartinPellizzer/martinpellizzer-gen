    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. glomerulans, commonly known as the clustered lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to round with a waxy, silver-green surface and a distinctive white or pale green underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in dense clusters during late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
