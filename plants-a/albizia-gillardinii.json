    "intro": "Albizia gillardinii, commonly known as the silky albizia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are finely divided and give the plant a feathery appearance. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, while its wood is lightweight and has a fine grain. Albizia gillardinii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
