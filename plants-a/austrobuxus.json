    "intro": "Austrobuxus, commonly known as the Australian boxwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Buxaceae. It consists of several species native to Australia, New Zealand, and surrounding islands. These plants are typically evergreen shrubs characterized by their dense, compact growth habit and glossy, dark green leaves. Austrobuxus species are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their ability to form neat, sculptural forms. They prefer well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making them adaptable to a variety of garden settings."
