    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia undulifolia var. dysophylla is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory, Western Australia, and South Australia. This variant is commonly found in sandy soils and is often associated with mulga woodlands and shrublands. It thrives in environments with low rainfall and high temperatures, showcasing its adaptability to harsh climatic conditions. The plant is well-known for its distinctive wavy leaflets and yellow flowers, which attract various pollinators. Due to its resilience, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia undulifolia var. dysophylla was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and along the edges of forests, thriving in sandy soils. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its hardy nature and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions. However, its spread has raised concerns about its potential impact on native vegetation. It is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
