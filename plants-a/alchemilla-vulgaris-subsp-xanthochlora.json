    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris subsp. xanthochlora, commonly known as golden alchemilla, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, dark green leaves and produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help retain moisture, and it is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine. The subspecies is distinguished by its more yellowish floral coloration compared to the typical greenish-yellow of the main species."
