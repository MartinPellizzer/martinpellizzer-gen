    "intro": "Ambrina tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly ambrina, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, soft, grayish-white pubescence that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Ambrina tomentosa is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands."
