It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, lance-shaped leaves that are often dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Alpinia involucrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens. Its rhizomes are also used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
