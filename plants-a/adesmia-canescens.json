It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, arid environments and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its seed pods are woody and contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Adesmia canescens is often found in grasslands and shrublands, contributing to local biodiversity.",
