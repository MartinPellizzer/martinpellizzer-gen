    "intro": "Aeranthes expansa, commonly known as the broadleaf orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature a vibrant color palette, including shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which stores water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Aeranthes expansa thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight."
