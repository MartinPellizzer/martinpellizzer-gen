It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and small, spikelet-based inflorescences. This subspecies is typically found in alpine and subalpine regions, thriving in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that gives it its common name. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh, mountainous habitat and is adapted to cold, windy conditions."
