It features compound leaves with feather-like divisions, typically arranged in a whorled pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and streambanks. The plant has a long history of use in traditional medicine and landscaping due to its ornamental value."
