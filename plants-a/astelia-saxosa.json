    "intro": "[WRONG START] Astilea saxosa, commonly known as the saxose astelia, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Alismataceae and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, boggy areas and is adapted to moist, nutrient-poor soils. It has lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Astelia saxosa is often found in coastal and inland wetlands, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
