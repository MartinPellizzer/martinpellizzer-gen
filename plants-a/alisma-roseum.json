    "intro": "Alisma roseum, commonly known as the rose-leaved water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in eastern North America. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically pink or rose-colored, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in ponds and streams. Alisma roseum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
