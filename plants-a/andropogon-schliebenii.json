    "intro": "Andropogon schliebenii, commonly known as Schlieben's bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in the summer months. Its root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments. It is an important component of the ecological community in its native range."
