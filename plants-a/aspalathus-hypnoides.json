    "intro": "Aspalathus hypnoides, commonly known as the African sleep weed, is a small, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers a sunny to partially shaded environment. Its unique ability to emit a mild sedative scent at night has earned it its common name. Aspalathus hypnoides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
