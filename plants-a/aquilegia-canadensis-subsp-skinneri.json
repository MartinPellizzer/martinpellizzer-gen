    "intro": "Aquilegia canadensis subsp. skinneri, commonly known as the Skinner's columbine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features basal leaves that are palmately lobed with a distinctive white to greenish hue. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It prefers moist, well-drained soils in partial to full shade and is often found in woodland habitats. This subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and shorter pedicels compared to the typical form of A. canadensis."
