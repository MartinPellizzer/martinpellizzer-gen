    "intro": "Aquilegia portae, commonly known as the Alpine Columbine, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spurred petals that come in shades of red, blue, and purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are deeply divided, forming a basal rosette, and it produces clusters of small, showy flowers in late spring to early summer. Aquilegia portae is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
