    "intro": "Acrostichum auritum, commonly known as the ear fern, is a tropical fern native to the Americas. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often adorned with ear-like lobes, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in soil, while its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds. Acrostichum auritum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture.",
