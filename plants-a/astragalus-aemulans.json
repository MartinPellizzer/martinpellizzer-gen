    "intro": "Astragalus aemulans, commonly known as the mimic milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility. Its seeds are small and often dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across open habitats."
