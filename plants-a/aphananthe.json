    "intro": "Aphananthe, commonly known as the silky oaks, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their bipinnate leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The genus includes several species, such as Aphananthe mollis and Aphananthe inophloia, which are often found in dry, sandy soils. Aphananthe species are typically deciduous, shedding their leaves during dry periods to conserve water. Their ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various native animals and insects."
