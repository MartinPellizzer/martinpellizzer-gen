    "intro": "Androsace frutescens, commonly known as the Alpine snowbell, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, often silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Androsace frutescens is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
