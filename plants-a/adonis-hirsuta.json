    "intro": "Adonis hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy adonis, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its leaves are palmately divided and covered in fine, hairy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Adonis hirsuta is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it contributes to the biodiversity of mountainous ecosystems.",
