    "intro": "Amperea podperae, commonly known as the Peruvian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Amperea podperae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
