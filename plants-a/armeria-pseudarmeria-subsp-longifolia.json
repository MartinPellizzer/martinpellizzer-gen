It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and prolonged blooming period."
