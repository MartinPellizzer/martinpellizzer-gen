It is characterized by its tropical and subtropical distribution, with species native to regions such as Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Americas. The plants typically have large, showy leaves and produce inflorescences that consist of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. Adenoropium species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Some species are cultivated for their ornamental value, while others have been used in traditional medicine."
