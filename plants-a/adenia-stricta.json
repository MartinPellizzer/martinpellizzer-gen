    "intro": "Adenia stricta, commonly known as the African waterleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often deeply lobed and can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded environments. Adenia stricta is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine.",
