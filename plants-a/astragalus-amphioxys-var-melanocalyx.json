    "intro": "Astragalus amphioxys var. melanocalyx, commonly known as the black-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, dark purple to black flowers, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. Its root system is extensive and adapted to survive in dry, nutrient-poor soils. This species is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
