    "intro": "Antholyza guthriei, commonly known as Guthrie's antholyza, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. Antholyza guthriei is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
