    "intro": "Anacamptis laxiflora subsp. palustris, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces tall, slender flowering stems that bear clusters of pale pink to white, spurred orchid flowers. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils, often found in bogs, fens, and marshes. Its morphology is adapted to waterlogged conditions, with a fibrous root system that helps anchor it in soft, saturated ground. The species is notable for its ecological importance in supporting pollinators and maintaining wetland biodiversity."
