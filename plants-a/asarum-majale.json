    "intro": "Asarum majale, commonly known as the Indian snakeroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshy areas of the Indian subcontinent. It features a tuberous root system that is often used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties. The plant has heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a velvety texture and emits a strong, aromatic odor. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, and typically have a distinctive, often unpleasant scent. Asarum majale is valued for its medicinal uses, though it contains toxic compounds that require careful handling."
