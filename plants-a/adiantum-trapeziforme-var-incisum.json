    "intro": "Adiantum trapeziforme var. incisum, commonly known as the incised maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to Southeast Asia. It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with a distinctive incised margin, giving it its common name. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in a unique, linear arrangement. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and shaded garden settings.",
