    "intro": "Achimenes, commonly known as the \"garden bell\" or \"flowering begonia,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. Native to tropical regions of the Americas, these plants are characterized by their tuberous roots and showy, bell-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors. They are typically herbaceous perennials that thrive in warm, humid climates and well-drained soil. Achimenes species are often cultivated for their ornamental value, with flowers that bloom in summer and early autumn. The leaves are usually heart-shaped and glossy, adding to the plant's aesthetic appeal."
