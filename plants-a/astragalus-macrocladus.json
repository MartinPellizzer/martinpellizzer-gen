    "intro": "Astragalus macrocladus, commonly known as the broad-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine environments. It has small, rounded seeds that are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine."
