    "intro": "Alyssum argyrophyllum, commonly known as silverleaf alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, white or silver-gray flowers. The plant features silvery, woolly foliage that gives it its common name and helps reflect sunlight, reducing water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Alyssum argyrophyllum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
