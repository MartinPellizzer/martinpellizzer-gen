It typically features small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pinkish-red, blooming in early summer. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that are often clustered at the base, and it produces small, dry fruits known as achenes. Astridia rubra thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along streambanks. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
