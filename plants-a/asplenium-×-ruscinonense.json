    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 ruscinonense, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium ruta-muraria. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided, dark green fronds that resemble those of its parent species. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodland areas or on rocky substrates. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sporangia located on the undersides of the leaves. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it does not produce viable seeds."
