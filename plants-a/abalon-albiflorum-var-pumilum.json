    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abalon albiflorum var. pumilum is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia. It is commonly found in coastal areas, including dunes and sandy soils near the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. This variety thrives in sunny, well-drained environments and is often seen in maritime hammocks and scrub habitats. It plays an important role in stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for native wildlife. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endangered plant species in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abalon albiflorum var. pumilum was mainly introduced to areas with a warm, humid climate and well-drained soils, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. It thrives in environments with high sunlight exposure and moderate to high rainfall. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowers. It has been introduced to several countries in Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems."
