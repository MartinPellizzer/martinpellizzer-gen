    "intro": "Agropyron thoroldianum, commonly known as the tall wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its robust growth habit, with tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Agropyron thoroldianum is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock."
