    "intro": "Acis, commonly known as the mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Acis thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it a common weed in gardens and natural habitats."
