It is a small to medium-sized tree with smooth, dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale green, followed by the characteristic yellow or greenish fruit with a rough, spiny exterior. The fruit contains a creamy, sweet pulp that is rich in nutrients and has a unique, custard-like texture. It is often cultivated for its edible fruit and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
