    "intro": "Alsophila martinicensis, commonly known as the Martinique tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery fronds. The plant has a distinctive root system that forms a thick, fibrous base, which helps anchor it in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically long and narrow, with a bright green color and a smooth, leathery texture. Alsophila martinicensis plays an important ecological role in tropical forests, providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
