    "intro": "Asclepias macropetala, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release silky, wind-dispersed seeds. Asclepias macropetala is an important host plant for monarch butterflies and other milkweed-dependent species."
