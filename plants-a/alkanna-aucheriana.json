    "intro": "Alkanna aucheriana, commonly known as the Indian madder, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. The roots of Alkanna aucheriana contain a red dye called alkanet root, which has been used historically for coloring textiles and food."
