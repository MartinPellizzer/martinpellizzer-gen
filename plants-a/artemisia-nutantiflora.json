    "intro": "Artemisia nutantiflora, commonly known as the nodding wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flower heads that nod downward, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open plains. Its leaves contain volatile oils, which contribute to its strong, distinctive scent and medicinal properties. Artemisia nutantiflora is also known for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
