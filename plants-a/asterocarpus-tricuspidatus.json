It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive three-lobed fruits that resemble small, star-shaped berries. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The fruit is edible when ripe, though it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
