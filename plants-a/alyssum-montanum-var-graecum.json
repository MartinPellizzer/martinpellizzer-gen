    "intro": "Alyssum montanum var. graecum, commonly known as the Greek alpine alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Alyssum montanum var. graecum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
