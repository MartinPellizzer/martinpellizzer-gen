    "intro": "Acalypha hamiltoniana, commonly known as the red veined nettle, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves with prominent red veins, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or forest understory environments. Acalypha hamiltoniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha hamiltoniana is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is commonly found in lowland forests and swampy areas. This species is also present in parts of the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii and parts of Oceania. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with riverine and coastal habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other tropical regions around the world.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha hamiltoniana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It was likely brought there during the 19th or early 20th century by horticulturists and gardeners seeking exotic plants for cultivation. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and can spread rapidly through vegetative reproduction. Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native plant species in island ecosystems."
