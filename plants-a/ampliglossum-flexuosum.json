It features slender, branching stems that often trail or climb, and its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens or containers. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
