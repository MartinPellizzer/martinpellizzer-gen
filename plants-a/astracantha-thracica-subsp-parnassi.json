    "intro": "Astracantha thracica subsp. parnassi, commonly known as the Parnassian bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It is characterized by its striking bell-shaped flowers, which are typically blue or violet in color. The plant grows in rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
