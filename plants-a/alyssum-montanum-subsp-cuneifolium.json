    "intro": "Alyssum montanum subsp. cuneifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf alpine alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with compact stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This subspecies thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh growing conditions."
