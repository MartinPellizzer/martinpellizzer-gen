It thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil. The species is commonly observed in lowland areas and along riverbanks. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus latisepalus was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its striking foliage and floral display. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and public spaces for its aesthetic value. The plant is native to South Africa but has been introduced to other regions, including parts of Europe and the United States. Its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in non-native environments. Proper management is recommended to prevent unintended spread and ecological impact."
