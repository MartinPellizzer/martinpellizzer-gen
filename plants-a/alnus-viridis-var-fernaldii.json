    "intro": "Alnus viridis var. fernaldii, commonly known as the Fernald's green alder, is a variant of the green alder native to the western United States. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in riparian areas. The plant features compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring. Its root system forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing streambanks and providing habitat for wildlife."
