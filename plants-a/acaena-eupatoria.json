    "intro": "Acaena eupatoria, commonly known as the New Zealand spinach or the mountain spinach, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its small, spiny fruits that contain edible seeds. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are edible and have a slightly spinach-like flavor, making it a traditional food source for M\u0101ori. The plant's unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat.",

This plant is commonly found in grasslands and open habitats within these regions. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The species is adapted to the environmental conditions of South America's southern regions. Its native range reflects its ecological preferences and historical distribution across these areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena eupatoria was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora introduced during the colonial period. The plant has since become naturalized and is now found in various habitats across the country. It is considered a weed in some areas due to its ability to spread rapidly. However, it also plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
