    "intro": "Arenaria condensata, commonly known as the dense sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny white or pink flowers, often appearing in early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Arenaria condensata is an important component of cold-climate ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
