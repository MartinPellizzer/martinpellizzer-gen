    "intro": "Ananas monstrosus, commonly known as the pineapple\u767e\u5408, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescence that resembles a pinecone, which is actually a modified stem called a scape. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which are followed by small, white berries. Native to South America, particularly Brazil, it thrives in warm, humid climates. Its unique appearance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for tropical gardens and indoor collections."
