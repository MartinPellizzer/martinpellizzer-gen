    "intro": "Agrostis lechleri, commonly known as \u00daritu or the \"milkweed of the Andes,\" is a perennial grass native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and silver-green foliage, with small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is notable for its latex-rich stems, which have been traditionally used in South American medicine. Its adaptability to high-altitude environments makes it a resilient species in harsh climates. Botanically, it belongs to the Poaceae family and is valued for both its ecological role and traditional applications."
