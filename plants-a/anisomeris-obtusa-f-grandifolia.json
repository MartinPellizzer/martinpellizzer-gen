    "intro": "Anisomeris obtusa f. grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered desert holly, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is low and spreading, with multiple stems that form a dense, cushion-like structure. The species is well-suited to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant for xeriscaping and desert gardens."
