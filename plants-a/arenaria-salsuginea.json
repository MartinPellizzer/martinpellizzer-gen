    "intro": "Arenaria salsuginea, commonly known as the sandstone saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is adapted to withstand harsh conditions, including high salinity and extreme temperatures. Its root system is shallow, allowing it to absorb moisture from the surface layer of soil. It plays an important role in stabilizing sandy and rocky soils in its native habitats."
