    "intro": "Astragalus sesameus var. brachycarpus, commonly known as the shortpod milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow to brown flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. Its seed pods are short and cylindrical, typical of the Astragalus genus. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
