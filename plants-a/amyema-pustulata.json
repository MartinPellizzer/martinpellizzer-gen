    "intro": "Amyema pustulata, commonly known as the pustulate lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is characterized by its bright green to yellowish thallus, which is covered in small, rounded pustules. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide photosynthetic energy. It is typically found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions. Its slow growth and unique morphology make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study."
