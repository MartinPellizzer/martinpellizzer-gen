    "intro": "Abolboda grandis var. grandis, commonly known as the giant abolboda, is a species of flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research.",

This species is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It typically thrives in humid, lowland areas with well-drained soils. The plant is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. Its distribution reflects its adaptability to diverse environmental conditions in the Neotropics.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abolboda grandis var. grandis was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its striking foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its aesthetic value and ease of maintenance. The plant's ability to thrive in both full sun and partial shade makes it a popular choice for gardeners and landscapers. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in non-native environments. Despite its ornamental appeal, careful management is recommended to prevent unintended ecological impacts."
