    "intro": "Asarum nankaiense, commonly known as Nankai asarum, is a perennial herb native to China. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and unique, irregularly shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. However, due to its toxic compounds, it is not recommended for medicinal use without proper guidance."
