    "intro": "Anthoshorea bracteolata, commonly known as the bracteolate anthoshorea, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive bracteolate structures that enclose its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with compound leaves that are alternate and often lobed. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
