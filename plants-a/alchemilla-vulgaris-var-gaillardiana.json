    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. gaillardiana, commonly known as the Mexican lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a mat-forming growth habit with thick, waxy leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
