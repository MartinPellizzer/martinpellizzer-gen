This species is found in the coastal regions of southeastern Brazil, particularly in the states of Esp\u00edrito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, and S\u00e3o Paulo. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal forests and sandy soils. The plant is commonly associated with humid, warm environments along the Atlantic coast. Its native distribution is limited to this specific region in Brazil.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon nigricans was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. The distribution of this species has expanded beyond its original range, sometimes becoming invasive in local ecosystems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along stream banks and in disturbed areas. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to outcompete native flora."
