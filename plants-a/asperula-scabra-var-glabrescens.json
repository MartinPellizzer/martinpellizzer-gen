    "intro": "Asperula scabra var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth asperula, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features small, dark green, leathery leaves that are typically hairless or nearly so, giving it a smooth appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
