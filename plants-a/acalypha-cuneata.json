    "intro": "Acalypha cuneata, commonly known as the arrowleaf acalypha, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial species that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters. The plant features heart-shaped, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, clustered flowers are usually greenish-yellow and are followed by distinctive, three-lobed seed capsules. Acalypha cuneata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions.",

This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these countries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. The species is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage. Its native range spans a significant portion of South America, particularly in the Andean and Amazonian regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha cuneata was mainly introduced to coastal and wetland areas for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil. It is commonly found in regions with high humidity and saline conditions. This plant has become naturalized in several tropical and subtropical regions. Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to its spread along shorelines and in disturbed habitats. However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas due to its competitive nature."
