    "intro": "Asplenium erectum var. harpeodes, commonly known as the Harpe's Shield Fern, is a variant of the erect shield fern native to the southeastern United States. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. The plant features a compact, upright rhizome with tightly clustered, ovate to lanceolate fronds that are usually dark green and leathery in texture. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens for its dense, lush foliage."
