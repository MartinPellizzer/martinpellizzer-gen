    "intro": "Atocion armeria, commonly known as the sea pink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It features dense clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or coastal cliffs. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh maritime conditions."
