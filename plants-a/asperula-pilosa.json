    "intro": "Asperula pilosa, commonly known as the hairy woodruff, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, wiry stems covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets that are also hairy. Asperula pilosa is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and is also known for its fragrant foliage."
