    "intro": "Astragalus plumosus var. sipikordaghensis, commonly known as the Sipikordagh milkvetch, is a rare and endemic species native to the Sipikordagh region of Turkey. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small, feathery leaflets, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
