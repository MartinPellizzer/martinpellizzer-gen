It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates, making it a hardy species. Agropyron rottboellioides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
