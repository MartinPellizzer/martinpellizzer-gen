    "intro": "Alisma bourgaei, commonly known as the Bornean water plant, is a semi-aquatic herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in wetlands and along the edges of streams. The plant has slender, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, supported by long, flexible stems. Its small, white flowers are clustered in inflorescences and bloom during the wet season. Alisma bourgaei plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
