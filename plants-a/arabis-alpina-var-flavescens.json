    "intro": "Arabis alpina var. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a vibrant touch to mountainous landscapes. Its leaves are basal, rosette-forming, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
