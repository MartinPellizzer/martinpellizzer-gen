    "intro": "Angiopteris fokiensis, commonly known as the Fuzhou water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to southern China. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, where it can receive adequate sunlight. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in aquatic habitats."
