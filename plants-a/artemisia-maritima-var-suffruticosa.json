    "intro": "Artemisia maritima var. suffruticosa, commonly known as sea wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in salt marshes and dunes. It has a creeping growth habit and can form dense mats, which help stabilize coastal soils. This variety is closely related to other artemisia species and is valued for its ecological role in coastal ecosystems."
