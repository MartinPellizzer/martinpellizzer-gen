    "intro": "Antirrhinum viscosum, commonly known as the sticky antirrhinum, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its glandular hairs that give the plant a sticky texture, which helps in deterring herbivores. The plant produces vibrant, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. The species is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
