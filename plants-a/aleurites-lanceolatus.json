    "intro": "Aleurites lanceolatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf chinaberry, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and pinnate, with lanceolate-shaped leaflets. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into orange to red berries, which are toxic to humans and livestock. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil types make it a common ornamental and shade tree. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spread."
