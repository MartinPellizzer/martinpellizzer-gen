    "intro": "Arctostaphylos bowermaniae, commonly known as the Bowerman\u2019s manzanita, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It is characterized by its reddish bark and dense, evergreen foliage, which provides habitat for various wildlife species. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by edible berries that are a food source for birds and mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a species of concern in some areas."
