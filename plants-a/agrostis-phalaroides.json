It typically grows in moist to wet soils in meadows, marshes, and along streambanks. The plant has slender, erect stems that bear spikelets arranged in dense, finger-like clusters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
