    "intro": "Asclepias tuberosa subsp. interior, commonly known as the interior milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking orange to yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are opposite, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are hairy and often reddish in color. This subspecies is an important host plant for the monarch butterfly and plays a vital role in supporting local pollinator populations."
