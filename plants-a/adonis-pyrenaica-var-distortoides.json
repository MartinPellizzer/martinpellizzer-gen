    "intro": "Adonis pyrenaica var. distortoides, commonly known as the distorted pyrenean adonis, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils at high altitudes, showcasing its adaptation to harsh, alpine environments. Its leaves are deeply lobed and often have a hairy texture, which helps in reducing water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.",
