    "intro": "Agrostis pilosula f. ciliata, commonly known as the silky bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along streambanks. Its inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters of small, pale green to brownish florets. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its ability to form a dense, soft turf."
