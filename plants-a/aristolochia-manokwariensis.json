    "intro": "Aristolochia manokwariensis, commonly known as the Manokwari Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the rainforests of New Guinea. It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, heart-shaped leaves and its striking, maroon-colored flowers that resemble a pipe. The plant belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is known for its complex, spiral-shaped inflorescence. Its flowers emit a strong, often unpleasant odor to attract specific pollinators, such as flies. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is a subject of interest in botanical research and conservation efforts."
