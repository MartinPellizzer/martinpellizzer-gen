    "intro": "Agapetes nuttallii, commonly known as the Nuttall's silverleaf, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and along stream banks. The plant features dense, silver-gray foliage due to its fine, overlapping leaves covered in a waxy cuticle. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are often white or pale pink, followed by berries that are edible for some bird species. Agapetes nuttallii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
