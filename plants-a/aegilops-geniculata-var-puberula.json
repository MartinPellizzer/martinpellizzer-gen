    "intro": "Aegilops geniculata var. puberula, commonly known as the pubescent wild wheat, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant has rough, hairy leaves and stems, which contribute to its common name. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in disturbed soils. This species is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for genetic contributions to modern wheat varieties."
