It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage. The plant typically grows in high-altitude forests and is adapted to cool, moist environments. Its leaves contain volatile oils, which contribute to its distinctive scent and potential medicinal properties. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
