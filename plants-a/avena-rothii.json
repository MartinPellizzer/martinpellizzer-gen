    "intro": "Avena rothii, commonly known as Roth's oat, is a species of grass native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Avena rothii is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
