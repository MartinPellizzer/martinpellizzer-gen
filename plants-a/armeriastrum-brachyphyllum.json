    "intro": "Armeriastrum brachyphyllum, commonly known as the short-leaved armeria, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to conserve water in arid environments. Armeriastrum brachyphyllum is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
