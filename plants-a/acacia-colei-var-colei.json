    "intro": "Acacia colei var. colei, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, bipinnate leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular inflorescences, which attract a variety of pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky coastal habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental plant in coastal gardens.",

This plant is often used for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It has been introduced for purposes such as soil stabilization and as a source of timber. However, its spread has raised concerns about its impact on native flora."
