    "intro": "Armeria canescens f. microphylla, commonly known as the silver sandplant, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant once established. This plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and ability to withstand harsh coastal conditions."
