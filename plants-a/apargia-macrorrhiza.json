    "intro": "Apargia macrorrhiza, commonly known as the large-rooted bladderwort, is a herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has specialized root structures that help it anchor in waterlogged soil and absorb nutrients. Its leaves are usually submerged or floating, and it is often found in shallow water environments. Apargia macrorrhiza is also known for its ability to produce tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms."
