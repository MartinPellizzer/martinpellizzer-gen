    "intro": "Agrostis peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. This plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in prairie and wetland habitats. Agrostis peninsularis has small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a forage plant for wildlife and its contribution to soil stabilization in its native range."
