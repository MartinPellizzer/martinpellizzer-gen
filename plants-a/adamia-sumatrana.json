    "intro": "Adamia sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Sumatra. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in clusters, showcasing a mix of white, yellow, and green hues. The plant has a slender, herbaceous stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific soil conditions rich in organic matter. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.",
