    "intro": "Ananassa monstrosa, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its massive, umbrella-shaped white flowers and large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to three meters in length. The plant contains phototoxic sap that can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks and in wet meadows. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
