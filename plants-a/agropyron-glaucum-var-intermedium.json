    "intro": "Agropyron glaucum var. intermedium, commonly known as intermediate wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the North American prairies. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, narrow leaves, and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant is adapted to a wide range of soil types and can thrive in both dry and moist conditions. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Additionally, it is considered a potential forage crop and has been studied for its nutritional value and resilience to climate stress."
