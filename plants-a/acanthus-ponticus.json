This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with dune ecosystems. It is also occasionally seen in rocky habitats near the sea. Its distribution is limited to specific geographic areas within Bulgaria due to its particular environmental requirements.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus ponticus was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. It has been widely cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and flowers. The plant is often found in gardens and along coastal areas where it thrives in well-drained soils. It has also been naturalized in some areas, leading to its spread beyond cultivated sites. Its introduction has contributed to both horticultural diversity and ecological changes in local environments."
