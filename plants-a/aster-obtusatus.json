It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a blunt or rounded tip, giving it its common name. The flowers bloom in the fall, producing purple to blue ray florets that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
