    "intro": "Alyssum subalpestre, commonly known as the alpine alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. Alyssum subalpestre thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
