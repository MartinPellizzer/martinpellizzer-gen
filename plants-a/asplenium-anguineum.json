    "intro": "Asplenium anguineum, commonly known as the red-stemmed spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth habit with dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish at the base. Its sporangia are clustered on the undersides of the leaves, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Asplenium anguineum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens or as a houseplant."
