    "intro": "Asplenium platybasis var. subnudum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern family with distinctive botanical features. It is a perennial evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. The plant has slender, arching fronds with a dark green, glossy appearance, and its leaves are characterized by a narrow, linear shape. The sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. This variant is noted for its compact growth habit and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
