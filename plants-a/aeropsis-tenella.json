    "intro": "Aeropsis tenella, commonly known as the air plant, is a unique epiphytic plant that thrives without soil by absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae and is native to the tropical regions of South America. The plant has a rosette-shaped structure with narrow, grass-like leaves that form a cup to collect rainwater. Its ability to grow on other plants makes it an excellent choice for hanging or mounted displays. Aeropsis tenella is relatively low maintenance, requiring minimal watering and indirect sunlight to flourish."
