    "intro": "Asplenium marginatum, commonly known as the marginal spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to various regions of the world, including Europe, Asia, and Africa. It typically grows on rocks, trees, or soil, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has slender, wiry stems with closely spaced, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium marginatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens or as a houseplant."
