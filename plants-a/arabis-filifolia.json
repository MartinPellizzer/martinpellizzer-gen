It features basal leaves that are linear and thread-like, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a valued addition to botanical collections."
