    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia magnifica is primarily native to eastern Australia, including regions of New South Wales and Queensland. It thrives in a variety of habitats, such as dry forests, woodlands, and coastal areas. This species is commonly found in sandy soils and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates. It plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for native wildlife. The plant is also known for its distinctive yellow flowers and is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia magnifica was mainly introduced to regions with warm, arid climates where it can thrive in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in parts of Australia, where it has been cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits. The plant is often used in landscaping due to its striking appearance and ability to withstand drought conditions. However, in some areas, it has become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on local ecosystems and biodiversity."
