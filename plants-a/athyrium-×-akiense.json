    "intro": "Athyrium \u00d7 akiense, commonly known as the Japanese painted fern, is a hybrid fern species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often variegated with silver and green hues. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. Botanically, it is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
