It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, yellow to orange flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Astragalus pentapetaloides is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
