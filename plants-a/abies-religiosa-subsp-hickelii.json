    "intro": "Abies religiosa subsp. hickelii, commonly known as the Mexican fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the high altitudes of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The cones are typically pendulous, with elongated, woody scales that release seeds in the fall. This subspecies thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in montane forests. Its botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystem and a subject of interest in botanical studies.",

This subspecies is found in the states of Sinaloa, Durango, and Chihuahua. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils, typically growing in pine-oak forests. The plant is adapted to the rugged terrain and variable weather conditions of these regions. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within these mountainous areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies religiosa subsp. hickelii was mainly introduced to areas with high elevation and cool, moist climates, typically found in mountainous regions. It is commonly found in the western United States, particularly in states like California, Nevada, and Utah. This subspecies is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes due to its ornamental value and hardiness. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its introduction has been primarily for horticultural purposes, although it can sometimes become invasive in certain environments."
