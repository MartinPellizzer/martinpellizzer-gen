It is characterized by its small, densely packed leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils. Due to its aromatic properties, it has been used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
