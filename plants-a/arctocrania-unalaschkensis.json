    "intro": "Arctocrania unalaschkensis, commonly known as the Alaskan bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is often found in tundra and alpine meadows. It has hairy leaves and stems, which help it retain heat in cold environments. Arctocrania unalaschkensis is adapted to short growing seasons and is an important part of the local flora in its native range."
