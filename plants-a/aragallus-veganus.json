It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and intricate, fragrant blossoms. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are typically pale green or white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Aragallus veganus is considered a conservation concern."
