    "intro": "Alamania punicea subsp. greenwoodiana, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a rare and critically endangered plant species native to specific regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive red bark and small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and coastal areas. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
