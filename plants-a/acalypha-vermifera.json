    "intro": "Acalypha vermifera, commonly known as the threadleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, thread-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Acalypha vermifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha vermifera is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is also found in parts of tropical Africa, including Nigeria and Ghana. This plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and is commonly found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its distribution is closely linked to regions with warm, moist environments and well-drained soils.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha vermifera was mainly introduced to control erosion and as an ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides due to its rapid growth and adaptability. The plant has been reported in several countries including Australia, New Zealand, and parts of Southeast Asia. However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas where it can outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns about its ecological impact in non-native habitats."
