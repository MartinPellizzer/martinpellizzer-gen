    "intro": "Agropyron magellanicum var. pubiflorum, commonly known as the Antarctic grass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that are often covered with short, soft hairs. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale green to brown flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. This plant is well-suited to arid and semi-arid conditions, making it an important component of the vegetation in high-altitude and polar regions."
