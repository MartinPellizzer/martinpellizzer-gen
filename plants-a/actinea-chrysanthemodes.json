    "intro": "Actinea chrysanthemodes, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as streams and ponds, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. The plant features delicate, star-shaped fronds that are typically bright green, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Its reproductive structures are borne on separate male and female plants, a characteristic known as dioecious. The plant plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small fish."
