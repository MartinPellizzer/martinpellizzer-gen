    "intro": "Alsophila bartlettii, commonly known as the Bartlett's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii, Fiji, and Tonga. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a distinctive crown of compound leaves that can reach several meters in length, giving it a tropical, lush appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in some areas."
