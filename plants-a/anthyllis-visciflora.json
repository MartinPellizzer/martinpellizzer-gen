    "intro": "Anthyllis visciflora, commonly known as the sticky vetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, creeping stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces pods containing small, sticky seeds, which aid in its dispersal. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Anthyllis visciflora is a hardy species that is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its distinctive appearance."
