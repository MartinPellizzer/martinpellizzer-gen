    "intro": "Armeria maritima var. rumelicina, commonly known as sea thrift, is a coastal plant native to the British Isles and parts of northern Europe. It is a low-growing evergreen perennial that forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of pink or white flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and harsh maritime conditions. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often used in coastal gardens and as a ground cover in difficult soil conditions."
