    "intro": "Antennaria maculata, commonly known as the dotted mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features small, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tiny, pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically clustered in dense, flat-topped inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Antennaria maculata is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads."
