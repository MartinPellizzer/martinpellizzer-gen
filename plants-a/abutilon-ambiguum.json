It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with disturbed habitats like roadsides and forest edges. It is also present in parts of the Caribbean and some regions of the southern United States. Its native range extends into certain areas of Africa and Southeast Asia, though these populations may be introduced rather than native.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon ambiguum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, ditches, and forest edges. This plant is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local ecosystems and biodiversity."
