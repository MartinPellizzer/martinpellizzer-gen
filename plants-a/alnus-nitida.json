    "intro": "Alnus nitida, commonly known as the silver alder, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray bark and small, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, with male and female flowers occurring on separate trees. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in alpine environments. Alnus nitida plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
