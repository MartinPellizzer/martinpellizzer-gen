    "intro": "Acer calcaratum, commonly known as the rock maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, irregularly shaped bark and its palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It thrives in rocky or well-drained soils and is often found in dry, exposed areas. Its compact size and ornamental value make it a popular choice for small gardens and landscapes.",

This species is commonly found in the mountainous regions of these areas. It thrives in temperate to subtropical climates with well-drained soils. The plant is often associated with forested landscapes in these regions. Its distribution spans across several countries in South and Southeast Asia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer calcaratum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and moderate climates, often found in rocky or limestone-rich regions. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and parks for its ornamental value, particularly its colorful autumn foliage. This plant prefers full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of Europe and North America. However, its spread is generally limited due to its specific habitat requirements and slower growth rate."
