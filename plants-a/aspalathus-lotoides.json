    "intro": "Aspalathus lotoides, commonly known as rooibos, is a shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant is well adapted to the arid climate, with deep roots that allow it to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. Its unique botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and commercial contexts. Rooibos is particularly notable for its caffeine-free, antioxidant-rich leaves used in the production of a popular herbal tea."
