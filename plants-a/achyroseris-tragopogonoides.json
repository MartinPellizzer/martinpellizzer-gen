    "intro": "Achyroseris tragopogonoides, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers and woolly, hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its root system is deep, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. The plant's structure and growth habits reflect its evolutionary adaptations to survive in harsh, dry climates.",
