    "intro": "Allium lefkadense, commonly known as the Lefkada garlic, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Lefkada in Greece. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its bulbous structure and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of white to pale purple flowers in late spring, which are often fragrant. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
