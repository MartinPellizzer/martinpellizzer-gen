    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha supera is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often seen in forest understories or near water bodies. It is also present in parts of northern Australia and some regions of the Pacific Islands. Acalypha supera is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive foliage.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha supera was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in natural ecosystems. The plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local biodiversity and land management practices."
