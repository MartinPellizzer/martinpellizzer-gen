    "intro": "Acalypha stellata, commonly known as the starleaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are often surrounded by bracts that add to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats. Acalypha stellata is valued for its aesthetic qualities and is sometimes cultivated as a garden plant.",

This plant thrives in humid, warm climates with well-drained soil. It is often seen in lowland areas and near riverbanks. Its native distribution is largely restricted to Ecuador, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha stellata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and small, star-shaped flowers. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become a weed in some areas, particularly in the North Island. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly along roadsides and in forest margins. Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems."
