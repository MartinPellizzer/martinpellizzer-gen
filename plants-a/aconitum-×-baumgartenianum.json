    "intro": "Aconitum \u00d7 baumgartenianum, commonly known as the hybrid monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with large, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets.",
