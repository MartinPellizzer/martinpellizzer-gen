    "intro": "Alsine multicaulis, commonly known as narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically features small, succulent leaves that are arranged in a dense rosette pattern, helping to conserve moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. Alsine multicaulis is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and disturbed soils, and is adapted to withstand drought and heat."
