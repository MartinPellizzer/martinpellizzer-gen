    "intro": "Asplenium blandulum, commonly known as the small shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered with a dense mat of roots, aiding in its ability to anchor in soil. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
