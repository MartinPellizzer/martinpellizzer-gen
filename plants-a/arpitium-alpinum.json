    "intro": "Arpitium alpinum, commonly known as the alpine arpitium, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
