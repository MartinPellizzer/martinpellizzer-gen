It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a fruit resembling a small, hairy apple, which turns from green to yellow or red as it ripens. Its botanical features include a woody stem, smooth bark, and a preference for moist, well-drained soils in partial shade. Asimina glabra is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
