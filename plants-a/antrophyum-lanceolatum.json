    "intro": "Antrophyum lanceolatum, commonly known as the lanceleaf cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that are lance-shaped and stiff. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
