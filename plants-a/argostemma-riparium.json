It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils.

The flowers are small and clustered, often with a strong odor that attracts pollinators like flies and beetles."
