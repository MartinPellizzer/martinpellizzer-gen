It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and reddish-brown stems that become more pronounced with age. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in terminal spikes, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and have a distinct aromatic scent when crushed. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
