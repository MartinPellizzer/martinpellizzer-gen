    "intro": "Alyssum bornmuelleri, commonly known as the Sierra Madre alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features silver-gray foliage and compact, mat-forming growth habit, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in arid and semi-arid environments. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fragrant flowers and drought tolerance."
