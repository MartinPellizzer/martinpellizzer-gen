    "intro": "Agrostis \u00d7 fouilladei, commonly known as the hybrid bentgrass, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis stolonifera. It is a low-growing, mat-forming grass that typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive blue-green coloration, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Due to its sterile nature, it does not produce viable seeds and is often propagated vegetatively. This species is commonly found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in landscaping."
