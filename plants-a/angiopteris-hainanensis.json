    "intro": "Angiopteris hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan water fern, is a species of fern native to southern China, particularly Hainan Island. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients. Angiopteris hainanensis plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystem."
