    "intro": "Astragalus darryensis, commonly known as Darry's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and its root system is typically deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor soils. It is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Astragalus darryensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
