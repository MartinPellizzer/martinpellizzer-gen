    "intro": "Anubias lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf anubia, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Africa. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant is often found in slow-moving or still freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. It has rhizomes that anchor it to substrates and can grow both submerged and emergent. Anubias lanceolata is popular in aquariums due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
