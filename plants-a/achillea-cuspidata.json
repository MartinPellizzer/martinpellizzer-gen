It features finely divided, feathery leaves that are gray-green in color and emit a subtle aromatic scent. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders. Its historical use in traditional medicine is attributed to its purported wound-healing properties.",
