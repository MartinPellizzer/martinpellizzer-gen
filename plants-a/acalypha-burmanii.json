This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded or semi-shaded areas. It is commonly seen in forest undergrowth and along stream banks. Its native distribution is largely restricted to Madagascar, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha burmanii was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It has been widely cultivated in countries such as India, Indonesia, and parts of Africa for its aesthetic value. The plant thrives in warm climates with high humidity and is often found in gardens and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds have led to its naturalization in some areas. However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it is cultivated."
