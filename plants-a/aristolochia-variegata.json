    "intro": "Aristolochia variegata, commonly known as the variegated Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, aromatic leaves with distinctive white and green variegation. The plant produces striking, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-white with a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires support for its vigorous growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it may be invasive in certain areas."
