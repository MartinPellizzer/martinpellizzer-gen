    "intro": "Alchemilla juzepczukii, commonly known as the Polish lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically borne on slender, branching stalks. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported soothing and healing properties. Alchemilla juzepczukii thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks."
