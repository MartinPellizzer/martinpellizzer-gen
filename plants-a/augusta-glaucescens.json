    "intro": "Augusta glaucescens, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, giving it a distinctive bluish-gray appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its overall ornamental value. Augusta glaucescens is well-suited for moist, partially shaded environments and is often used in native plant gardens."
