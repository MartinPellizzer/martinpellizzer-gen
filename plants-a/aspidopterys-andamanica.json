It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its unique morphological features, including its distinctive leaf shape and clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in syconia, which are specialized structures typical of the fig genus. Aspidopterys andamanica plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various local fauna. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially vulnerable species."
