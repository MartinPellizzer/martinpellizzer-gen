    "intro": "Alyssum lenense var. longistylum, commonly known as the long-styled alyssum, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces showy, elongated flower stalks that distinguish it from other alyssum varieties. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a silvery-gray appearance due to fine hairs. This variety is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a ground cover for its ornamental value and hardiness."
