    "intro": "Aconitum variegatum subsp. variegatum, commonly known as the variegated monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features palmately compound leaves with distinctive white and green variegation, which contribute to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets.",
