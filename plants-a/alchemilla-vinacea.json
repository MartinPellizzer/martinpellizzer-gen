    "intro": "Alchemilla vinacea, commonly known as sweet alchemilla, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features basal leaves that are velvety and often covered in fine hairs, with a distinctive reddish or purplish hue. Its small, yellowish flowers appear in clusters during the summer months, and it produces achenes as its seeds. Alchemilla vinacea is often found in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
