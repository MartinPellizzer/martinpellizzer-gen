    "intro": "Artemisia diversifolia, commonly known as the diverseleaf wormwood, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a distinctive, pungent scent, which is due to the presence of volatile oils. Artemisia diversifolia is often used in traditional medicine and has ecological significance as a food source for certain wildlife species."
