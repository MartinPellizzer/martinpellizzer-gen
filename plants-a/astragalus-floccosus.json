    "intro": "Astragalus floccosus, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
