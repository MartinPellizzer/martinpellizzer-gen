    "intro": "Agrostis blasdalei, commonly known as the Blasdell's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and small, spikelet-based inflorescences. This plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along streambanks. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. Agrostis blasdalei plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small invertebrates."
