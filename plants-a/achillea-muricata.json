It features a robust rhizomatous root system and can grow up to 1 meter tall, with a basal rosette of silver-gray, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flower heads, which are composed of numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and rocky areas. Its name is derived from the Greek myth of Achilles, who used the plant to treat wounds.",
