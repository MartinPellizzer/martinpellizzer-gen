    "intro": "Aeschynomene sansibarica, commonly known as the East African stylo, is a perennial leguminous plant native to East Africa. It is characterized by its erect growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable forage species for livestock in dry regions. It has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through its association with rhizobia, improving soil fertility. Additionally, it is used in agroforestry systems and for erosion control due to its extensive root system."
