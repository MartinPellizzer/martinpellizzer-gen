    "intro": "Abutilon balansae, commonly known as the velvetleaf abutilon, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous bark and hairy foliage contribute to its distinctive appearance and ecological role in its native habitat.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon balansae is primarily native to Argentina Northeast and Paraguay. This species is found in the temperate regions of these countries. It thrives in areas with well-drained soils and moderate climate conditions. The plant is commonly found in grasslands and open woodlands. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon balansae was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species. It was likely introduced through accidental transport via shipping or gardening activities. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it well-suited to the Hawaiian environment. It spreads rapidly through seeds dispersed by wind, water, or animals. Due to its aggressive growth, it poses a threat to native ecosystems and biodiversity."
