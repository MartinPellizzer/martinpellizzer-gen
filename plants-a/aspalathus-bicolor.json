    "intro": "Aspalathus bicolor, commonly known as rooibos, is a shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green flowers and needle-like leaves. The plant is unique in that it does not require pollination, as its flowers are functionally male. Rooibos is primarily grown for its leaves, which are harvested and processed to produce a popular herbal tea. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat."
