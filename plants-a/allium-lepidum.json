    "intro": "Allium lepidum, commonly known as the bulbous leek, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces tall, erect flowering stems that bear small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters. Its bulbs, which are smaller than those of leeks, are edible and have a mild, onion-like flavor. Allium lepidum is often cultivated for both its ornamental value and culinary uses."
