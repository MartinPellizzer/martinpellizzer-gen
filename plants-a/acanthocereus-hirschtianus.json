    "intro": "Acanthocereus hirschtianus, commonly known as the desert night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its spineless stems and clustered flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in arid environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink and emit a fragrant scent to attract nocturnal pollinators. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes and botanical gardens.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthocereus hirschtianus is primarily native to Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. This cactus species is typically found in dry to semi-arid regions within these Central American countries. It thrives in rocky soils and is often seen in scrublands and coastal areas. The plant is well adapted to the tropical and subtropical climates of its native range. Its distribution is largely confined to these specific geographic locations.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthocereus hirschtianus was mainly introduced to regions with arid or semi-arid climates, particularly in parts of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is commonly found in desert environments where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. This cactus is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive spiny stems and occasional flowering. It has been introduced to various botanical gardens and private collections as a hardy, low-maintenance plant. However, its spread in the wild is limited due to its specific habitat requirements and slow growth rate."
