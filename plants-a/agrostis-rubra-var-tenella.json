    "intro": "Agrostis rubra var. tenella, commonly known as red wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fine, hairy leaves that are typically reddish in color, especially at the base, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to reddish flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
