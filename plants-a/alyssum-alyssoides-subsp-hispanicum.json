It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in spring. The plant has a mat-forming habit with dense, hairy leaves that help it thrive in rocky or sandy soils. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Alyssum alyssoides subsp. hispanicum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
