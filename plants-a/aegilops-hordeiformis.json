    "intro": "Aegilops hordeiformis, commonly known as the goatgrass, is a wild relative of wheat that belongs to the grass family Poaceae. It is a diploid species with a genome size that is smaller than that of common wheat, making it a valuable genetic resource for breeding programs. The plant typically grows in temperate regions and has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing\u9896\u679c, which are enclosed in bracts. Due to its genetic similarity to wheat, it is studied for its potential to improve crop resilience and yield through hybridization."
