    "intro": "Atriplex ehrenbergii, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to saline and drought-prone environments. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in soils with high sodium content. Atriplex ehrenbergii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and prevent erosion."
