    "intro": "Agave horrida var. micracantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved agave, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its robust, spiny leaves that are typically narrow and recurved, providing a protective barrier against herbivores. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears small, greenish-white flowers, which are often pollinated by bats and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping in desert environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
