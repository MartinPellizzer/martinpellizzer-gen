    "intro": "Asclepias echinata, commonly known as the prickly pear milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces specialized seed pods called follicles, which contain toxic seeds covered in fine, sticky hairs. Asclepias echinata serves as a vital host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing nourishment for its larvae. Its unique botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and medicinal contexts."
