    "intro": "Armeria scabra subsp. sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has slender, upright stems covered with fine, silver-gray hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its leaves are linear and often covered with a waxy coating, adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
