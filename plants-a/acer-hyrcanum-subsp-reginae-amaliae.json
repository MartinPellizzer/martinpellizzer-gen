It is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems.",
