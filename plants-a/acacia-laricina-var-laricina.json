    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia laricina var. laricina is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the southern and western regions of the state. This plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often associated with shrublands and open woodlands. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native habitat. The species is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in supporting native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia laricina var. laricina was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and moderate to warm climates, typically found in regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is commonly found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, open woodlands, and rocky slopes. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It has also been introduced as an ornamental plant in some regions for its attractive foliage and floral display. However, its invasive potential in certain areas has raised concerns among land managers."
