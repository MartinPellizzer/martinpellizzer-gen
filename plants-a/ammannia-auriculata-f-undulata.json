It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its distinctive, undulating leaves that give it its common name. The leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a waxy surface and a prominent midrib. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
