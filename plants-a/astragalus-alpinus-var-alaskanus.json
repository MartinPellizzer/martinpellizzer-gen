    "intro": "Astragalus alpinus var. alaskanus, commonly known as the Alaska milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, where it thrives in cold, dry conditions. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow to reddish-purple flowers. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor in poor, well-drained soils. This species is adapted to harsh climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
