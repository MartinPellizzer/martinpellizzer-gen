    "intro": "Aspidium rarum, commonly known as the rare water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its spores are dispersed through the water, contributing to its reproductive strategy. The fronds are usually divided into small, lance-shaped segments that help in maximizing light absorption for photosynthesis."
