    "intro": "Asclepias cynanchoides, commonly known as green antelopehorn, is a species of milkweed native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers, which are followed by distinctive, bean-like seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in prairies and open woodlands. Asclepias cynanchoides is an important host plant for monarch butterflies, supporting their life cycle."
