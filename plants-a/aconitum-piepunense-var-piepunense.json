    "intro": "Aconitum piepunense var. piepunense, commonly known as the Tibetan monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features palmately compound leaves with serrated edges, and its tuberous roots are highly toxic due to the presence of alkaloids. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is often protected in its native habitat.",
