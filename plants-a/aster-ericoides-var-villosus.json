    "intro": "Aster ericoides var. villosus, commonly known as the downy heath aster, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the northern United States and southern Canada. It features small, clustered flower heads with purple to pinkish-purple petals, blooming in late summer to early fall. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which give it its \"villosus\" variety name, meaning \"hairy\" in Latin. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or heathlands. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to support pollinators in native gardens."
