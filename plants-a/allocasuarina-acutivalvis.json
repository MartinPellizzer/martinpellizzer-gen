    "intro": "Allocasuarina acutivalvis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf she-oak, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical, needle-like leaves that are closely packed around the stems. The plant produces small, spherical flowers that are typically green or yellow-green in color. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Allocasuarina acutivalvis is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland heathlands."
