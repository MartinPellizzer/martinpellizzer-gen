This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Abutilon palmeri is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon palmeri was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Nevada. It is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and along creek banks. This plant has become naturalized in these regions, thriving in dry to moist soils. Its introduction is likely due to human activity, including landscaping and accidental seed dispersal. It is considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation."
