    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthopanax yui var. parvispinosus is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in the provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan. This variant thrives in temperate to subtropical climates, often found in dense forests and rocky hillsides. It is commonly associated with areas of high biodiversity and is well adapted to the region's moist, cool conditions. The plant is also occasionally found in adjacent regions of northern Vietnam. Its distribution is limited to these specific ecological niches, reflecting its preference for particular soil and climate conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopanax yui var. parvispinosus was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, particularly in regions of East Asia. It thrives in forested environments and is commonly found in mountainous regions of China. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique foliage and growth habit. It has also been introduced to other parts of the world as a horticultural specimen. However, its spread is limited due to specific environmental requirements and potential ecological constraints."
