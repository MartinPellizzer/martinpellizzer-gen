    "intro": "Aspidium subinerme, commonly known as the narrow-veined water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered with fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium subinerme is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
