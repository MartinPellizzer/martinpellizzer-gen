    "intro": "Abies cinerea, commonly known as the white fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and its silver-blue foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The needles are short, stiff, and have a whitish coating, contributing to its common name. It produces cones that hang downward, containing seeds surrounded by a papery wing. This species is often found in high-elevation forests and is adapted to cool, moist climates.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies cinerea is primarily native to western North America, including parts of the United States and Canada. It is commonly found in the mountainous regions of the Pacific Northwest, such as Washington, Oregon, and northern California. This species thrives in cool, moist environments at high elevations, often in coniferous forests. It is also present in the Canadian provinces of British Columbia and Alberta. Abies cinerea is well adapted to the climate and soil conditions of these regions, making it a characteristic component of the local flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies cinerea was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically at higher elevations. It thrives in regions with moderate temperatures and ample precipitation, making it suitable for mountainous and subalpine environments. This plant is often found in forested areas, where it forms dense stands or grows as an understory species. Its introduction has been noted in several regions outside its native range, including parts of North America and Europe. However, its establishment in these new areas is often limited by environmental conditions and competition with native flora."
