    "intro": "Andersonia geniculata, commonly known as the mountain rock orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of southern Africa. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact, clump-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale green, with a distinctive spurred lip. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
