It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its flowers, which bloom in the summer, range from white to purple, and are often surrounded by narrow, grass-like leaves. Aster oreophilus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
