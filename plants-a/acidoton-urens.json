    "intro": "Acidoton urens, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Urticaceae family. It is characterized by its hollow, hairless stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine,\u87ab\u523a (stinging) hairs. The plant contains a mixture of histamine, acetylcholine, and formic acid in its stinging hairs, which cause an itchy, burning sensation upon contact. Acidoton urens is native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and diuretic properties.",
