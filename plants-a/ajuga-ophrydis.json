    "intro": "Ajuga ophrydis, commonly known as the common bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features dark green, ovate leaves with slightly hairy surfaces and produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in early to mid-summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Ajuga ophrydis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to prevent soil erosion."
