It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates with dry summers. It is often found in coastal fynbos vegetation and is valued for its ornamental appeal. The subspecies is distinguished by its glabrous (hairless) petals, which give it its specific epithet."
