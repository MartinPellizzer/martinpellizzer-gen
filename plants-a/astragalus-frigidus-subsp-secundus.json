    "intro": "Astragalus frigidus subsp. secundus, commonly known as the cold astragalus, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of northern Europe and North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, usually blue or purple flowers. The plant has small, compound leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, cold climates. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous environments. Astragalus frigidus subsp. secundus plays a role in stabilizing soil in its extreme habitats and supports local pollinator populations."
