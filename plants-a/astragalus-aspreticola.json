    "intro": "Astragalus aspreticola, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and compound leaves. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soil conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
