    "intro": "Astragalus consimilis, commonly known as the similar milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Astragalus consimilis is known for its deep root system, which helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
