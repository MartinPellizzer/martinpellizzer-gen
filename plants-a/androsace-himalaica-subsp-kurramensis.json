It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its dense rosette of hairy, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
