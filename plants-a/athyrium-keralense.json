It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of spore-bearing leaves called sporangia. Athyrium keralense is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
