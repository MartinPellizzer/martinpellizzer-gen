    "intro": "Angraecum conchiferum, commonly known as the sacred violet, is a climbing orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves and striking, fragrant white flowers with long, narrow petals. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Angraecum conchiferum is known for its nocturnal blooming habit, often opening its flowers at night. This species is also notable for its historical significance in the development of Darwin's theory of natural selection."
