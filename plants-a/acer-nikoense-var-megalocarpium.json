    "intro": "Acer nikoense var. megalocarpium, commonly known as the giant-seeded maple, is a rare and striking variant of the Japanese maple. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 20 centimeters in diameter, displaying vibrant colors throughout the growing season. The plant produces massive, clustered fruits that are significantly larger than those of typical maple species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a prized addition to botanical gardens. Due to its rarity and unique features, it is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological interest.",
