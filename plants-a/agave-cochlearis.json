    "intro": "Agave cochlearis, commonly known as the spiral agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick, fleshy, and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The leaves are typically blue-green in color and have a distinctive spiral pattern along their edges. It produces a tall, branched inflorescence with yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments."
