    "intro": "Alchemilla fontinalis, commonly known as water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia. It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to round, with a waxy surface and a serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in terminal panicles during the summer months. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and pond edges. Its common name is derived from its historical use in alchemy and its association with water environments."
