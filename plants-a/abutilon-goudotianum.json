    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon goudotianum is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in lowland areas with warm, humid climates and is often associated with disturbed habitats like roadsides and abandoned fields. This species thrives in areas with well-drained soil and ample sunlight, making it a common sight in tropical forests and agricultural landscapes. It is also occasionally found in parts of the Indian subcontinent, particularly in northeastern India. Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to other tropical and subtropical regions around the world.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon goudotianum was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value due to its attractive, maple-like leaves and showy flowers. It is commonly found in gardens and as a decorative plant in areas with warm climates. The species has been cultivated in parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and some regions of the Americas. Its introduction has sometimes led to its naturalization in local ecosystems. However, it is not considered invasive in most of these areas."
