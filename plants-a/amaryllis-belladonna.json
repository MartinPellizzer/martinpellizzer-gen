    "intro": "Amaryllis belladonna, commonly known as the deadly nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries and its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep red. The plant contains toxic compounds such as atropine and scopolamine, making it dangerous if ingested. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in woodland or rocky habitats. Despite its toxicity, it has been historically used in medicine and as a source of psychoactive substances."
