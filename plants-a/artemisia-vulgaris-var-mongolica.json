    "intro": "Artemisia vulgaris var. mongolica, commonly known as Mongolian wormwood, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and slender, branched stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late summer, followed by small, fluffy seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its chemical composition, it has been used traditionally in medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
