    "intro": "Alchemilla pubescens subvar. plicata, commonly known as the woolly lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It features basal leaves that are softly hairy and arranged in a rosette, with the upper leaves becoming smaller and more upright. The plant produces yellowish-green flower clusters in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender, branched peduncles. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
