    "intro": "Agrostis poluninii, commonly known as the Polunin's bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is a perennial species, meaning it lives for more than two years, and is known for its ability to form dense turf. Due to its ecological significance, it is often considered an indicator species for certain habitat types."
