    "intro": "Arrhenatherum palaestinum, commonly known as the Palestine meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Middle East and parts of Europe. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and wetlands. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
