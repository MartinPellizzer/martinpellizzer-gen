    "intro": "Astragalus anserinifolius, commonly known as the goosefoot milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with a distinctive, rounded, goosefoot-shaped leaflet. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically borne on slender, branching stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands and sagebrush habitats. Astragalus anserinifolius is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment."
