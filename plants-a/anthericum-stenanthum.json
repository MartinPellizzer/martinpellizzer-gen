    "intro": "Anthericum stenanthum, commonly known as narrow-leaved ladies' tresses, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its dense, dark green, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a tall spike of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Anthericum stenanthum is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds."
