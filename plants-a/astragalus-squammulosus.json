It is characterized by its slender stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, scale-like structures, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Astragalus squammulosus plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
