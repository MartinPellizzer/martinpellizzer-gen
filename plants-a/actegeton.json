    "intro": "Actegeton, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species that are typically found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and yellow composite flowers that resemble dandelions. They are often mistaken for true dandelions due to their similar appearance. Actegeton species are generally herbaceous and have a fibrous root system."
