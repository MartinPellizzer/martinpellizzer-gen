    "intro": "Agrostis pleiophylla, commonly known as the many-leaf bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern and eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along waterways. Agrostis pleiophylla plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
