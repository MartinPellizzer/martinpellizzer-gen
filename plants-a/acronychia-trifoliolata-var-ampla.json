    "intro": "Acronychia trifoliolata var. ampla, commonly known as the broad-leafed acronychia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Meliaceae. It is native to northern Australia and is characterized by its large, trifoliate leaves that are often broader than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, elongated fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in coastal areas and rainforests. The species is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used traditionally by Indigenous communities.",
