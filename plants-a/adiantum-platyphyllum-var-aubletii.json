    "intro": "Adiantum platyphyllum var. aubletii, commonly known as the Aublet's maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often near streams or in forest understories. Its leaves are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique feature that aids in its survival by attracting nocturnal pollinators. This variant is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.",
