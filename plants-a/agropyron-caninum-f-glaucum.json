    "intro": "Agropyron caninum f. glaucum, commonly known as the glaucous wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its distinctive bluish-gray foliage due to a dense coating of trichomes. It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. It is notable for its high drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in disturbed areas. The glaucous wheatgrass is also valued for its use in forage and erosion control."
