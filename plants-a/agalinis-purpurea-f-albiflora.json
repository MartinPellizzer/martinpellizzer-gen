    "intro": "Agalinis purpurea f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered false foxglove, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic growth habit and lack of chlorophyll. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, with a slightly hairy surface. This variety is distinguished by its pale floral coloration, which sets it apart from the more commonly seen purple-flowered form of the species."
