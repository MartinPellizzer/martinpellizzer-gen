    "intro": "Aspidium latissimum, commonly known as the broad fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Aspidium latissimum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
