    "intro": "Aethionema cardiophyllum, commonly known as the heartleaf rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that are often heart-shaped, giving it its common name. It produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and as a ground cover."
