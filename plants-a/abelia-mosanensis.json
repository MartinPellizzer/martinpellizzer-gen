    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelia mosanensis is primarily native to Southeast Asia, specifically parts of China, Vietnam, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is typically found in forests and along riverbanks. Its natural range includes regions with a warm climate and abundant rainfall.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia mosanensis was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive flowering and adaptability to various growing conditions. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is native to tropical Africa but has been widely distributed in regions with warm climates, including parts of the southern United States. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance plants. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in some non-native environments."
