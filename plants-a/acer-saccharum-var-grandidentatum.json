    "intro": "Acer saccharum var. grandidentatum, commonly known as the sugar maple variant with large teeth, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its broad, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of yellow and orange in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. Its heartwood is light brown and valued for its strength and durability in woodworking. This variety is often found in mixed hardwood forests and is an important component of the ecosystem.",
