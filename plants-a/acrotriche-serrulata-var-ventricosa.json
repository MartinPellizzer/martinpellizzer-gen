It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in wetlands. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. It is often found in the southeastern states, including Florida and Georgia.",
