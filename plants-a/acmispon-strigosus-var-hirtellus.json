    "intro": "Acmispon strigosus var. hirtellus, commonly known as the hairy needlepod, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, and its small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has small, trifoliate leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and stabilize soil.",
