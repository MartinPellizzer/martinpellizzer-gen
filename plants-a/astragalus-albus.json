It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are typically dispersed by wind. Astragalus albus is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a forage plant for livestock."
