It features rosettes of fleshy, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, tubular flowers that are typically violet or blue in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
