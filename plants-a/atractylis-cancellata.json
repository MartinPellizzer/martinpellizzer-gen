    "intro": "Atractylis cancellata, commonly known as the white thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features a robust, upright stem covered with dense, white, woolly hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces pale yellow to greenish-yellow composite flowers, which are arranged in a circular pattern on the top of the stem. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped, with a rough texture and prominent veins. Atractylis cancellata is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in Mediterranean climates."
