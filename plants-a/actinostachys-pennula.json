    "intro": "Actinostachys pennula, commonly known as the feather-stemmed horsetail, is a member of the Equisetaceae family, characterized by its ancient lineage and unique morphology. This plant features a tall, slender stem with a distinctive whorl of leaves at the top, giving it a feathery appearance. It possesses a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, typical of its primitive reproductive strategy. Actinostachys pennula is often found in wetlands and along streambanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.",
