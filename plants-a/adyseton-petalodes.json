    "intro": "Adyseton petalodes, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in the summer months. Its root system is fibrous and can spread widely, making it a persistent weed in agricultural settings. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils contribute to its invasive potential in certain regions."
