    "intro": "Acetosella bupleurifolia, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats, making it a common ground cover in its native habitat. Acetosella bupleurifolia is also known for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.",
