    "intro": "Astragalus schachimardanus, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant has a deep taproot system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor and drought-prone soils. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated for ornamental purposes or in restoration projects."
