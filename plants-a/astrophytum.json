    "intro": "Astrophytum, commonly known as the star cactus, is a genus of cacti native to the deserts of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped body with radial spines and a short, thick stem. The plant's leaves are modified into spines, and it produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer. Astrophytum species are typically slow-growing and require well-draining soil and minimal water. They are popular among cactus enthusiasts for their unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
