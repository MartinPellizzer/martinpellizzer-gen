    "intro": "Arum hygrophilum var. ponticum, commonly known as the Pontic arrowhead, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in eastern Europe and western Asia. It features heart-shaped, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface, adapted for water retention. The plant produces small, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a spathe, characteristic of the Araceae family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its aesthetic appeal and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland gardens."
