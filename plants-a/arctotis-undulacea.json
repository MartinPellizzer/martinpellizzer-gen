    "intro": "Arctotis undulacea, commonly known as the undulating arctotis, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss. Its vibrant yellow or orange flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Arctotis undulacea is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
