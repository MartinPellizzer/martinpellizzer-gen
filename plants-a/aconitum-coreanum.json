It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces striking blue to purple spurred flowers that bloom in late summer. It is known for its toxic alkaloids, which make it a potentially dangerous plant to handle. Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is often cultivated in gardens with caution.",
