    "intro": "Agropyron cristatum subsp. dasyanthum, commonly known as the tufted wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically green or brown. It is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological and agricultural purposes in dryland environments."
