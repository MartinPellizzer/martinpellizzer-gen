    "intro": "Arachniodes tiendongensis, commonly known as the Tien Dong fern, is a rare species of fern native to China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds with a distinctive, almost spider-like appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are usually a deep green, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
