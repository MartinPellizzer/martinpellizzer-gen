    "intro": "Athyrium kaalaanum, commonly known as the black fern, is a species of fern native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with intricate, serrated edges. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in rows. Athyrium kaalaanum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often used in shaded garden settings."
