    "intro": "Asclepias phenax, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers with distinctive, hood-like structures called galeae. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine, white\u7ed2\u6bdb. Asclepias phenax is an important host plant for monarch butterflies, providing nourishment for both larvae and adult insects."
