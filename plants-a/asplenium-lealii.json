    "intro": "Asplenium lealii, commonly known as the Leal's spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are simple and lack the complex branching seen in many other ferns. Asplenium lealii is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, nutrient-rich soils."
