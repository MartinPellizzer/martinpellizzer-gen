    "intro": "Artemisia domingensis, commonly known as wild wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features aromatic, gray-green foliage with silvery-white undersides, and its leaves are covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, and it is often found growing in dry, rocky soils. Artemisia domingensis is known for its strong, camphor-like odor and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine. Its resilience to drought and poor soil conditions makes it a hardy plant in xerophytic environments."
