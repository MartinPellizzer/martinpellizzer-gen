    "intro": "Aliteria sagotii, commonly known as the Kauri tree, is a large evergreen tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and broad, dark green leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by fleshy, red berries. Aliteria sagotii is known for its longevity, with some individuals living over 1,000 years. However, it is now critically endangered due to habitat loss and disease."
