    "intro": "Alphitonia ponderosa var. lanaiensis, commonly known as the Lanai alphitonia, is a rare endemic species native to the Hawaiian island of Lanai. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green on the upper surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a small, smooth, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and invasive species."
