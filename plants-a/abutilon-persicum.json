It is commonly found in regions with mild winters and hot, dry summers. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers. It has been introduced to parts of the United States, particularly in California and Arizona. However, it is considered invasive in some regions, where it can outcompete native vegetation."
