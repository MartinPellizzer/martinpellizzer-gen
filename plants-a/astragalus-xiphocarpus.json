    "intro": "Astragalus xiphocarpus, commonly known as the mountain milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky environments and has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Astragalus xiphocarpus is also valued for its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
