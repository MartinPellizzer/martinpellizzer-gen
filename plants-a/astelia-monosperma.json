    "intro": "[WRONG START] Astellia monosperma, commonly known as the single-seeded astelia, is a rare and unique plant native to New Zealand. It is a member of the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single, elongated seed capsule that contains a single seed, a feature that distinguishes it from other astelia species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Astelia monosperma is considered a vulnerable species."
