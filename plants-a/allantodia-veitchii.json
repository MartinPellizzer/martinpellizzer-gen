    "intro": "Allantodia veitchii, commonly known as the Veitch's allantodia, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, spurred flowers that range in color from violet to white. The plant features a slender, upright stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
