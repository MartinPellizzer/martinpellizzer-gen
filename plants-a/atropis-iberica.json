    "intro": "Atropis iberica, commonly known as the Iberian atropis, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils, often in Mediterranean climates with mild, wet winters. Its botanical features include aromatic leaves and a distinctive umbel-like inflorescence, which contribute to its ecological and horticultural interest. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
