    "intro": "Agave scabra subsp. maderensis, commonly known as the Mader's agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with small, white to pale green flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
