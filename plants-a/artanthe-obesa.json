    "intro": "Artanthe obesa, commonly known as the fat artanthe, is a striking perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its swollen, bulbous stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its foliage consists of broad, wavy-edged leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Artanthe obesa is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
