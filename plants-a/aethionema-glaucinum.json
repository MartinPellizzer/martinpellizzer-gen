    "intro": "Aethionema glaucinum, commonly known as the silverleaf sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, oblanceolate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white to greyish hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Aethionema glaucinum is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and hardy nature."
