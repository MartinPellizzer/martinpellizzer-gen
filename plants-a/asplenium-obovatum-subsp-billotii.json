    "intro": "Asplenium obovatum subsp. billotii, commonly known as the Billot's maidenhair fern, is a fern species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, lance-shaped leaves. The spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in compact clusters, typical of the fern family."
