    "intro": "Asplenium trichomanes var. vespertinum, commonly known as the evening fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern. It is a small, delicate fern characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that resemble the shape of a fern's typical structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of many ferns. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
