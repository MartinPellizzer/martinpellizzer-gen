    "intro": "Actinidia setosa, commonly known as the silver vine, is a deciduous climbing shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its finely hairy, silver-gray foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in early summer, followed by edible, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Actinidia setosa thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soil. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional Chinese medicine.",
