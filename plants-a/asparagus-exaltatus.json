    "intro": "Asparagus exaltatus, commonly known as the tall asparagus, is a perennial plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fern-like, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by cylindrical, spiky fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or container planting. Asparagus exaltatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to Mediterranean climates."
