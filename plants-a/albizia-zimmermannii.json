    "intro": "Albizia zimmermannii, commonly known as the silky albizia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in cylindrical clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its seeds are enclosed in flat, pod-like fruits that split open when mature. Albizia zimmermannii is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
