    "intro": "Agropyron elongatum subsp. corsicum, commonly known as Corsican needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica and Sardinia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as rocky slopes and coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized plant species."
