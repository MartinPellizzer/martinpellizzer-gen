    "intro": "Asplenium anceps, commonly known as the common rock fern, is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and dark green, lance-shaped fronds. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found on rocky substrates or in shaded forest floors. Asplenium anceps is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
