    "intro": "Astragalus beatleyae, commonly known as the Beatley's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus beatleyae is also noted for its medicinal properties, though it is primarily valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
