    "intro": "Asplenium campos-portoi, commonly known as the Campos-Portoi spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
