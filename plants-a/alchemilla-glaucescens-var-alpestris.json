    "intro": "Alchemilla glaucescens var. alpestris, commonly known as the Alpine lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in spring, typically in clusters at the base of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with dry, sunny conditions."
