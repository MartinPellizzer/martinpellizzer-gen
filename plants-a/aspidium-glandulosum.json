    "intro": "Aspidium glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular water fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant features a rhizomatous structure with fronds that are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a complex, lace-like appearance. Its leaves are covered in small, glandular dots, which contribute to its common name and may play a role in water retention. Aspidium glandulosum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
