    "intro": "Aspidium vulcanicum, commonly known as the volcanic shield fern, is a species of fern native to volcanic regions. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its fronds that are typically bipinnate or tripinnate. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its leaves. Aspidium vulcanicum is notable for its ability to colonize disturbed or volcanic soils, making it an important indicator species in such habitats."
