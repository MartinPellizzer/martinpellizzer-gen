    "intro": "Alsine maritima var. pallens, commonly known as sea sandwort, is a halophytic plant adapted to coastal environments. It thrives in saline soils and is often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. It produces tiny white or pale flowers that bloom in summer. Its root system stabilizes sandy soils, contributing to coastal dune formation."
