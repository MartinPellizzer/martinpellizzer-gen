    "intro": "Anthurium leveillei, commonly known as the velvet leaf anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces striking spadices, which are modified leaves that enclose the true flowers, often in vibrant red or orange hues. Anthurium leveillei thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
