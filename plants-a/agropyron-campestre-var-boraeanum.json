    "intro": "Agropyron campestre var. boraeanum, commonly known as the Boreal wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to cold climates of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. This variety thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas such as meadows and tundra. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, aiding in its propagation across harsh environments. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
