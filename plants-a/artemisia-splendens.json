    "intro": "Artemisia splendens, commonly known as silver sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, aromatic leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters during the summer months, which are borne on slender stalks. Artemisia splendens is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. It is also valued for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
