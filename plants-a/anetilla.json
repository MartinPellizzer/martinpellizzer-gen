    "intro": "Anetilla, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a low-growing perennial herb belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and colonize moist, shaded areas. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically appearing in early spring. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. Anetilla is often found in woodland floors and along stream banks, where it thrives in damp, nutrient-rich soil."
