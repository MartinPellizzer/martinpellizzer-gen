    "intro": "Astragalus troodi, commonly known as the Sierra foothill milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, oval seeds that are typically dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Astragalus troodi plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment."
