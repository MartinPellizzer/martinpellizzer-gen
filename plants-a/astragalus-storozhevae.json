    "intro": "Astragalus storozhevae, commonly known as the Storozhene Astragalus, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or white. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and it produces slender, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Astragalus storozhevae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
