    "intro": "Aspidium capillipes, commonly known as the slender spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its leaves, a feature typical of many ferns. Aspidium capillipes thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or on tree trunks. Its small size and subtle appearance make it a challenging but rewarding plant for botanical enthusiasts."
