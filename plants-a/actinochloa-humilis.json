    "intro": "Actinochloa humilis, commonly known as the dwarf grass or small-leaved grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its fine, narrow leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Actinochloa humilis is also of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil in certain habitats.",
