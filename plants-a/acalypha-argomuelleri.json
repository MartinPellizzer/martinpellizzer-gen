It typically grows in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. The plant is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Its native distribution is limited to these specific geographic locations.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha argomuelleri was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It is commonly found in areas with warm climates and well-drained soils. The plant has been reported in several countries in the Pacific and Southeast Asia. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming invasive in certain ecosystems. Proper management is recommended to prevent its spread beyond cultivated areas."
