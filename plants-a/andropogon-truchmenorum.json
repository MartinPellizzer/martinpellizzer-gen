It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often rolled at the edges. This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common component of tallgrass prairie ecosystems. Its flowering spikes appear in late summer, producing small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated. Andropogon truchmenorum plays an important role in soil stabilization and provides habitat and forage for various wildlife species."
