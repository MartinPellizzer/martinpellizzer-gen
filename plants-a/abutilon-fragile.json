    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon fragile is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and the Greater Antilles. It is also found in parts of Central America, such as southern Mexico and the northern regions of South America. This plant typically grows in coastal areas, mangroves, and other moist, tropical environments. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found near the shoreline or in brackish water habitats. Its native range is limited to these specific geographic regions, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon fragile was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, maple-like leaves and showy flowers. It was likely brought there by early settlers or horticulturalists who admired its aesthetic value. Despite its ornamental appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it well-suited to the environment of the Pacific Islands. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds have led to concerns about its impact on local ecosystems."
