    "intro": "Astragalus trichanthus, commonly known as the three-stamen milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant has trifoliate leaves and produces pods that contain several small, dark seeds. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus trichanthus is often found in grasslands and rocky areas, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and ecological balance."
