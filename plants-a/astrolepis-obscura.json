It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, fibrous layer, which helps in water retention. Astrolepis obscura is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to humid conditions."
