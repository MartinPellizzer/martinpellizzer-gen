    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abildgaardia setifolia is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It thrives in rocky and coastal environments, often found on cliffs and slopes. This plant is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is commonly associated with maritime climates. It is also present in some areas of the Middle East and southern Turkey. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats that provide the right balance of sunlight, soil type, and moisture.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abildgaardia setifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, fern-like foliage. It was first recorded in the late 19th century and has since spread throughout the country, particularly in regions with a temperate climate. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it is considered a noxious weed in some areas because of its aggressive growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. The plant's introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to disrupt local ecosystems. Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on native flora."
