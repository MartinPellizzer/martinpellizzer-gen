    "intro": "Abatia microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved abatia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in humid, lowland areas with rich soil. The plant has simple, opposite, and usually elliptical leaves that are small in size. Its flowers are yellow and appear in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.",

It is found in the southeastern region of Brazil, particularly in the states of S\u00e3o Paulo, Minas Gerais, and Esp\u00edrito Santo. This plant typically grows in humid tropical forests and is often found in areas with high rainfall and warm temperatures. It is commonly associated with secondary growth areas and is sometimes found in disturbed habitats. Its distribution is limited to this specific geographic region within Brazil.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abatia microphylla was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as an ornamental plant or for erosion control. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil conditions. The plant is native to Central and South America but has been introduced to various regions outside its native range. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative means have led to its establishment in some non-native environments. However, it is not considered invasive in most areas where it has been introduced."
