    "intro": "Arabis arenosa var. runcinata, commonly known as the sandy rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes, gravelly slopes, and disturbed areas. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations."
