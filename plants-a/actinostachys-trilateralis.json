    "intro": "Actinostachys trilateralis, commonly known as the three-angled sword fern, is a tropical fern native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive triangular, sword-shaped fronds that are often divided into segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant. The fronds are typically evergreen, providing a lush green appearance throughout the year.",
