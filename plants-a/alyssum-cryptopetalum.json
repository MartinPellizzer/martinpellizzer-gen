It features small, fragrant, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract beneficial insects like bees and butterflies."
