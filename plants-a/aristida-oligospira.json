    "intro": "Aristida oligospira, commonly known as the narrowleaf threeawn, is a grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss. Aristida oligospira is an important component of native grassland ecosystems."
