    "intro": "Andropogon incomptus, commonly known as little bluestem, is a warm-season grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and tufted growth habit, which make it visually distinct. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens and restoration projects. Its flowering stems produce small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically brown or purple in color. Andropogon incomptus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
