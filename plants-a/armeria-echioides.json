    "intro": "Armeria echioides, commonly known as the sea thrift, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It features dense clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its saline, coastal habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and harsh winds makes it a popular ornamental plant in maritime environments."
