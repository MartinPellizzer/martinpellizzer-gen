It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has a compact growth habit with fleshy, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate flowers and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
