    "intro": "Atacama, commonly known as the Atacama Desert plant, is a resilient species adapted to extreme arid conditions. It belongs to the genus Lepidium and is native to the hyperarid regions of northern Chile. The plant features small, compact leaves that minimize water loss through transpiration. It produces tiny, white or green flowers that bloom during brief periods of rainfall. Its unique botanical traits make it a symbol of survival in one of Earth's most hostile environments."
