This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including forests, savannas, and disturbed soils. The subspecies is known for its adaptability to different environmental conditions. Its native range spans across much of South America, particularly in the eastern and central regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha communis subsp. communis was mainly introduced to areas where its ornamental value and adaptability make it a desirable landscape plant. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in the Pacific Islands, Southeast Asia, and parts of the Americas. This species thrives in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and coastal areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction contribute to its invasive potential in some regions. However, it is also valued for its vibrant foliage and is used in horticulture and traditional medicine in various cultures."
