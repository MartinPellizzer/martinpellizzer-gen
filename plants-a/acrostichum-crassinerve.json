It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive broad and prominent midrib. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid forests or near water bodies. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds. Acrostichum crassinerve plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various invertebrates and small animals.",
