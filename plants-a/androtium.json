    "intro": "Androtium, commonly known as the black mold, is a genus of fungi that belongs to the order Eurotiales. It is characterized by its dark, velvety appearance and is often found in soil, decaying plant matter, and on surfaces in humid environments. The genus includes several species that can cause spoilage of organic materials and are sometimes associated with indoor air quality issues. Androtium species are typically identified by their branched, septate hyphae and the production of spores in chains. These fungi are not typically pathogenic to humans but can be a nuisance in controlled environments such as laboratories or greenhouses."
