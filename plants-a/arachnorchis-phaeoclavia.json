    "intro": "Arachnorchis phaeoclavia, commonly known as the yellow spider-orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance with long, slender petals. The plant typically grows in sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss, it is listed as vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
