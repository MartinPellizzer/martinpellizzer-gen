    "intro": "Aegiphila mollis var. mollis, commonly known as the silverleaf shrub, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its aromatic leaves and compact growth habit make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and erosion control."
