    "intro": "Arenaria atuntziensis, commonly known as the Iberian sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its compact rosette of hairy, linear leaves and small white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats. It is adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is typically found in Mediterranean climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
