It is also found in parts of North Africa, including Morocco and Algeria. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments and is commonly found in rocky or sandy soils. It is often associated with Mediterranean climates and can be seen in grasslands and open woodlands. Its native range extends into the Iberian Peninsula and the western parts of the Balkan Peninsula.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Absinthium spicatum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and along riverbanks. It thrives in temperate climates with moderate moisture levels. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas quickly. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain regions. It is often found in areas where human activity has altered the natural landscape."
