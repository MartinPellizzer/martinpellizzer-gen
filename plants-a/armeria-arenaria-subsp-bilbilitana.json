    "intro": "Armeria arenaria subsp. bilbilitana, commonly known as the Bilbilitan thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to coastal and maritime climates. Its foliage consists of narrow, linear leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, providing protection against salt spray and strong winds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in coastal landscaping and restoration projects."
