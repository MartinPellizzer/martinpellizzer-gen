    "intro": "Atalantia racemosa var. henryi, commonly known as Henry's Chinese tallowtree, is a variant of the Chinese tallowtree native to China. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in racemes, followed by orange to red berries that contain several seeds. It is adapted to a variety of soil types and thrives in full sun, making it a common ornamental plant in warmer climates. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
