    "intro": "Artemisia helvetica, commonly known as European wormwood, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which consists of aromatic, lance-shaped leaves with a strong, camphor-like scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in summer, typically in clustered inflorescences. Artemisia helvetica thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in open woodlands or along roadsides. It is valued in traditional medicine and has been used for its purported antiseptic and digestive properties."
