    "intro": "Agrostis densiflora var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal densegrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dune ecosystems and coastal grasslands. The plant has compact, tufted growth with narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand wind and salt spray. Its flowering spikes are dense and produce small, spikelet-based flowers typical of the Poaceae family. This variety plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
