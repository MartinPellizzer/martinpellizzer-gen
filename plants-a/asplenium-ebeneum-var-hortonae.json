    "intro": "Asplenium ebeneum var. hortonae, commonly known as the Horton's spleenwort, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that typically grow in dense, moss-like clusters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its spores are dispersed through the air, and the plant reproduces primarily through spore germination rather than sexual reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
