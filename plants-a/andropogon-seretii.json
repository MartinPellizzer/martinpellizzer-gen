    "intro": "Andropogon seretii, commonly known as the seretii bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its root system is extensive, helping to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats. Andropogon seretii plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
