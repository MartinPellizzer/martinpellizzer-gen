It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or mountainous regions. Its compact growth habit and ability to withstand harsh climates make it a resilient addition to xeriscapic gardens."
