    "intro": "Alsophila basirotundata, commonly known as the broad-shouldered tree fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive trunk that is covered in a rough, fibrous layer, which provides structural support. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a soft glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique feature makes it a striking and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat."
