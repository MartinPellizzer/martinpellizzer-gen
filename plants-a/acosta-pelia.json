    "intro": "Acosta pelia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with pale green leaves and a single, elongated flower that often resembles a ghostly figure. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires a specific balance of light and moisture to flourish. Due to its rarity and ecological sensitivity, Acosta pelia is considered an endangered species.",
