    "intro": "Amygdalus \u00d7 rhodia, commonly known as the hybrid peach almond, is a cross between Prunus persica (peach) and Prunus dulcis (sweet almond). It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers in the spring, followed by edible drupes that are similar in appearance to peaches but with a more delicate flavor. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for horticultural breeding programs. The fruit is often used in culinary applications and can also be processed for oil extraction."
