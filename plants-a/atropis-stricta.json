    "intro": "Atropis stricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arum, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features a short, stout rhizome and produces striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a glossy texture. The plant's most distinctive feature is its spadix, a cylindrical cluster of tiny, densely packed flowers enclosed within a modified leaf called a spathe. It blooms in late spring to early summer, with the spathe often displaying vibrant colors such as red, purple, or white. Atropis stricta is often found in moist, shaded environments like forest floors or along stream banks."
