    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon schenckii is primarily native to South America, specifically found in countries such as Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in open habitats like savannas, grasslands, and forest edges. It is often seen growing along riverbanks and in disturbed areas. Its native range includes parts of the Amazon Basin and the Paran\u00e1 River region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon schenckii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It was brought there during the late 19th or early 20th century by horticulturists and gardeners seeking to diversify local plant collections. Despite its aesthetic value, it has since become an invasive species, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems and outcompeting indigenous vegetation. Its introduction highlights the unintended ecological consequences of bringing non-native plants to new environments. Efforts are now underway to control its spread and mitigate its impact on native biodiversity."
