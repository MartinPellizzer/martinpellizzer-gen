It features long, slender, pale green or white petals that resemble stars, giving it its common name. The plant produces fragrant, nocturnal flowers that attract specific pollinators, such as hawkmoths. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical research and conservation efforts."
