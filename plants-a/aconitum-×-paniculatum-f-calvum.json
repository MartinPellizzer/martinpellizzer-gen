    "intro": "Aconitum \u00d7 paniculatum f. calvum, commonly known as the hairless monkshood, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers, which are typically arranged in a tall, branched inflorescence. The leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive hood-shaped petal known as the \"hood\" or \"galea.\" This variety is notable for its reduced leaf pubescence, giving it a smoother appearance compared to other Aconitum species. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and can thrive in moist, well-drained soils.",
