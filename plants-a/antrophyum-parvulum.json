    "intro": "Antrophyum parvulum, commonly known as the small antrophyum, is a rare and unique species of cycad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its distinctive, fern-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spore-bearing cones, typical of its ancient lineage. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range. Conservation efforts are essential to protect this rare botanical specimen from threats such as habitat loss and over-collection."
