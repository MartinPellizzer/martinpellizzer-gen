The botanical features include elongated, strap-like leaves that are often a vibrant green, and flowers that display a range of colors, typically in shades of pink, red, and white. It is native to South America and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun to partial shade. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various garden settings."
