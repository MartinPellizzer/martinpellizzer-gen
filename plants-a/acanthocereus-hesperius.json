    "intro": "Acanthocereus hesperius, commonly known as the night-blooming cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in spines and have a ribbed structure. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its adaptations include a succulent structure for water storage and a nocturnal blooming cycle to conserve moisture. The plant thrives in arid environments and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.",

This species is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the country, particularly in the states of Sonora and Sinaloa. It thrives in rocky soils and is often associated with desert scrub and coastal dunes. The plant is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native habitat. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem, providing food and shelter for various desert wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthocereus hesperius was mainly introduced to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is commonly found in desert environments, particularly in areas with well-drained soils. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking, spiny stems and vibrant flowers. It has been introduced to various regions as a drought-tolerant landscaping option. However, it is important to note that its spread can sometimes lead to ecological concerns in non-native habitats."
