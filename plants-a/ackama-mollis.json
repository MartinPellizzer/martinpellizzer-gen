    "intro": "Ackama mollis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety hair, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that contains numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Ackama mollis is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils.",
