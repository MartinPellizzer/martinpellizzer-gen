    "intro": "Astragalus calycinus var. grandiflorus, commonly known as the large-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
