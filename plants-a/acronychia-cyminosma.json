    "intro": "Acronychia cyminosma, commonly known as the lemonwood or yellowwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to northern Australia. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is often found in coastal and lowland rainforest habitats, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.",
