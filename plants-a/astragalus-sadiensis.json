    "intro": "Astragalus sadiensis, commonly known as the Sierra foothill milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to California. It is characterized by its hairy stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Astragalus sadiensis is a valuable plant for supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native range."
