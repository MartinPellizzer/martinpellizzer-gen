    "intro": "Allophylus bicruris, commonly known as the two-tailed holly, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 2 to 4 meters and has dense, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries that are often red when mature. Its botanical features include opposite leaf arrangement and the presence of stipules, which are leaf-like structures at the base of the petioles. Allophylus bicruris is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature."
