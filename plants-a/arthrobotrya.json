    "intro": "Arthrobotrya, commonly known as the glassy fan fungus, is a type of lichen that belongs to the family Caloplacaceae. It is characterized by its crust-like growth form and a distinctive, glassy appearance on its upper surface. The thallus is typically pale to dark brown, and it often grows on tree bark or rock surfaces in temperate regions. Arthrobotrya species are chemically complex, producing various secondary metabolites that contribute to their ecological roles. These lichens are often used in ecological studies to assess air quality due to their sensitivity to environmental changes."
