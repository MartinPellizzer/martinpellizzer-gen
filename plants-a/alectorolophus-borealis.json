    "intro": "Alectorolophus borealis, commonly known as the northern alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of North America. It features a rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue and violet. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in subalpine or alpine meadows. It is adapted to cold climates and has a short growing season. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
