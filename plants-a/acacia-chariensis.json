    "intro": "Acacia chariensis, commonly known as the black wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and small, globular yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces long, flat pods that contain seeds coated in a sticky, resinous substance. Acacia chariensis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. It plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for various native wildlife species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia chariensis is primarily native to the arid regions of southern Africa, including parts of Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. It thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found in savanna and semi-desert environments. This species is well adapted to dry conditions and can survive with minimal rainfall. It is commonly found in areas with high temperatures and low humidity. Acacia chariensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia chariensis was mainly introduced to Australia. It is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the country. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber. It has also been introduced to some parts of Southeast Asia for its ornamental value. However, its spread is limited due to its specific climatic requirements."
