    "intro": "Asplenium athyrium, commonly known as the maidenhair spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices, woodlands, and along streams. The plant features delicate, finely divided leaves that are often dark green and slightly curled. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium athyrium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
