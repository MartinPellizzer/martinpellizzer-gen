    "intro": "Acer tetramerum var. elobulatum, commonly known as the Oregon maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and distinctive palmate leaves with five lobes. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red samaras that disperse its seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its seasonal color changes.",
