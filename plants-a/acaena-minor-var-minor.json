    "intro": "Acaena minor var. minor, commonly known as New Zealand spinach, is a low-growing perennial plant native to New Zealand. It features small, trifoliate leaves and produces yellow flowers that develop into spiny, berry-like fruits. The plant is adapted to temperate climates and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often cultivated for its edible leaves, which are similar in taste to spinach. However, the plant is also known for its ornamental value due to its compact growth habit and attractive foliage.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena minor var. minor is primarily native to the Antipodean Islands and Macquarie Island. This plant is found in the Southern Ocean region, specifically on these remote islands. It thrives in coastal and subantarctic environments, often in rocky or sandy soils. The species is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of these southern territories. Its distribution is limited to these specific locations, reflecting its ecological niche in the southern hemisphere.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena minor var. minor was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. The plant has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. It is commonly found in coastal and subalpine areas, often forming dense mats. Its introduction has had both ecological and horticultural impacts in its new environment."
