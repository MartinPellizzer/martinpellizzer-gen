    "intro": "Astragalus acmophylloides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, compound leaves that are typically narrow and hairy. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to survive in dry, rocky soils. Astragalus acmophylloides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
