    "intro": "Allium cepa var. sanguineum, commonly known as the red onion, is a botanical variant of the onion species characterized by its striking red to purple bulb coloration. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is native to Central Asia, though it is now widely cultivated globally. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces umbels of small, white or pink flowers. Its bulbs are rich in sulfur compounds that contribute to its pungent aroma and flavor. This variety is valued both for culinary use and as an ornamental plant in gardens."
