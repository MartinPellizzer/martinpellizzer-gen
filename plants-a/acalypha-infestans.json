    "intro": "Acalypha infestans, commonly known as the red-rooted spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its striking red stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Acalypha infestans is also known for its ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative propagation.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha infestans is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is also found in parts of India and the Pacific Islands. This species thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. It is commonly found in lowland forests and along stream banks. Its native range extends to some regions of Oceania, where it has become an invasive species in certain areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha infestans was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in disturbed areas. It is commonly used in restoration projects due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions but has been introduced to various parts of the world. It can form dense stands that may outcompete native vegetation, leading to ecological concerns. Despite its benefits, its invasive potential requires careful management in non-native environments."
