    "intro": "Angelica macrocarpa, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to eastern North America. It features large, compound leaves that can reach up to 3 feet in width, with a distinctive heart-shaped base. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in umbrella-like inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, and the plant is known for its strong, aromatic odor. However, it is toxic due to the presence of phototoxic compounds, making it a potential hazard when handled without protection."
