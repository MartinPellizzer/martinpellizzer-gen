    "intro": "Acaena sanguisorbae subvar. rubescentistigma, commonly known as the red-stigma bramble, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, spiny leaves and produces bright red, showy flowers that bloom in spring. The plant's fruits are small, red berries that are edible and often consumed by birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest margins and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena sanguisorbae subvar. rubescentistigma is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the mountainous regions of the western and central areas. This subvariety thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. It is commonly associated with grasslands and shrublands at high elevations. The plant is well adapted to the cool, moist conditions typical of New Zealand's highland zones.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena sanguisorbae subvar. rubescentistigma was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of ornamental plant introductions due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation in certain areas. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in coastal and subalpine regions. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to alter local ecosystems."
