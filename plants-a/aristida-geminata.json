    "intro": "Aristida geminata, commonly known as the twin-awn grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, with each spikelet containing two bracts that give it its common name. It is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can tolerate drought conditions. Its ecological importance includes providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing sandy or rocky soils."
