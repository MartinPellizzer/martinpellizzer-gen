    "intro": "Alyxia calcicola, commonly known as the limestone alyxia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is adapted to grow in limestone soils, which influence its growth habits and chemical composition. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which are adapted for pollination by insects. It has small, leathery leaves that reduce water loss, a key adaptation to its harsh environment. Alyxia calcicola is often found in rocky outcrops and is an important component of local flora in its native habitat."
