    "intro": "Atriplex lapathifolia, commonly known as saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its succulent, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in saline soils, making it an important component of desert ecosystems. The leaves and stems are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
