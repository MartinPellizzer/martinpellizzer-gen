    "intro": "Actaea rubra f. arguta, commonly known as the dwarf white baneberry. It is a variant of the white baneberry, characterized by its shorter stature and pale, almost white berries. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its foliage consists of compound leaves with serrated edges, and it produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring. The plant is notable for its striking contrast between its dark, glossy leaves and its pale fruiting bodies.",
