    "intro": "Agropyron cristatum var. macranthum, commonly known as the crested wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the steppes of Eurasia. It is characterized by its distinctive crested inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-like flowers. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable plant for erosion control and pasture. Its deep root system helps it thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions."
