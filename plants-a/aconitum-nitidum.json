    "intro": "Aconitum nitidum, commonly known as the glossy monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking, hood-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, with a distinctive spurred petal at the back. The plant has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a fine, silky hair. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.",
