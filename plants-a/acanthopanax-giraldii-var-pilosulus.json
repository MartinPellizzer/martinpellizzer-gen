    "intro": "Acanthopanax giraldii var. pilosulus, commonly known as the hairy devil's ivy, is a climbing shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in shaded, moist forest environments. The hairy texture of its stems and leaves gives it its common name and distinguishes it from other species in the genus.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthopanax giraldii var. pilosulus is primarily native to the mountainous regions of eastern China, particularly in the provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan. This variant is commonly found in subtropical and temperate forests at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. It thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils, often growing on rocky slopes or in dense undergrowth. The plant is part of the Araliaceae family and is known for its woody stems and compound leaves. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopanax giraldii var. pilosulus was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often found in forested regions. It is typically distributed in mountainous areas where it thrives in partial shade and moderate moisture levels. This plant is commonly found in parts of East Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan. Its introduction to new regions is often associated with horticultural interests due to its ornamental value. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts."
