    "intro": "Arenaria bertolonii f. burnatii, commonly known as the Burnatii sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky and sandy soils of southern Europe. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in a fine layer of white or gray pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is adapted to harsh environments and is often found in alpine or coastal regions."
