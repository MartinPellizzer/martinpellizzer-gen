    "intro": "Arabis ambigua var. scabra, commonly known as the rough rockcress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or arctic environments. The plant features basal leaves that are linear to oblanceolate, with a rough, hairy texture due to its varietal name \"scabra.\" Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and arranged in clusters, blooming in early spring. It is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
