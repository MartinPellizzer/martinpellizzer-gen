    "intro": "Amygdalus mira, commonly known as the Persian almond, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, hard nuts enclosed in a thick, leathery shell, similar to true almonds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates with cold winters. Due to its ornamental value and potential for nut production, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
