    "intro": "Agropyron littorale var. nodosum, commonly known as sea barleygrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it an important pioneer species in coastal dunes. Its ability to stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion makes it ecologically significant in maritime environments."
