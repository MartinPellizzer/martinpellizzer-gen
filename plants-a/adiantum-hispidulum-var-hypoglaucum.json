    "intro": "Adiantum hispidulum var. hypoglaucum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that are often curled at the tips. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the late spring and summer months.",
