    "intro": "Anastraphia herrerae, commonly known as the Herrera's anastraphia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, preferring well-drained, acidic soils. Its flowers, which range in color from pale pink to white, bloom during the rainy season and attract various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Anastraphia herrerae is considered a species of conservation concern."
