It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves that are often marked with silver or white stripes. The plant produces vibrant red or orange spadices, which are the modified leaves that enclose the true flowers. It is a member of the Araceae family, known for its unique inflorescence structure. Anthurium caloveboranum is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and air-purifying qualities."
