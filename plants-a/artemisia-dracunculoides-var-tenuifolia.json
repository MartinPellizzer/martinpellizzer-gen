    "intro": "Artemisia dracunculoides var. tenuifolia, commonly known as slender tansy, is a perennial herb native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in compact, spherical clusters called cymes. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along rocky slopes. Due to its aromatic properties and historical medicinal uses, it has been cultivated for both ornamental and practical purposes."
