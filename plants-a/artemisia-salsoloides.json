    "intro": "Artemisia salsoloides, commonly known as sand artemisia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in terminal clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Artemisia salsoloides is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystem."
