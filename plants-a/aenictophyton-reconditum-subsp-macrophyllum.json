    "intro": "Aenictophyton reconditum subsp. macrophyllum, commonly known as the giant fern of the Cretaceous, is a fossil plant belonging to the order Marattiopsida. It is characterized by its large, compound fronds that suggest a tropical or subtropical habitat. The plant's morphology indicates it was a robust, tree-like fern with a complex vascular system. Its leaves are preserved in various sedimentary layers, providing insights into ancient ecosystems. This subspecies is notable for its size and structural complexity, reflecting the diversity of prehistoric plant life."
