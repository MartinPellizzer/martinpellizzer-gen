    "intro": "Allosorus caudatus, commonly known as the trailing bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and its ability to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant has a rosette of leaves that form a dense mat, with specialized bladder-like structures used for capturing prey. Its roots are often submerged, and it thrives in nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils. Allosorus caudatus plays an important ecological role in its habitat by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling."
