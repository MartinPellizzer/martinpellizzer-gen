    "intro": "Asplenium oligolepidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate and rare fern species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is typically found in cloud forests or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a feature common among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Asplenium oligolepidum is considered a species of conservation concern."
