    "intro": "Acer truncatum var. pilosum, commonly known as the hairy maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun, making it a suitable ornamental plant in gardens. Its unique foliage and adaptability make it a valued addition to both natural and cultivated landscapes.",
