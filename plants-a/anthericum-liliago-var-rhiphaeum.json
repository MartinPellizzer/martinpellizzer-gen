    "intro": "Anthericum liliago var. rhiphaeum, commonly known as the purple anthericum, is a variant of the common anthericum, characterized by its striking violet to purple flower color. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia, typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces tall, slender flowering stems with clustered, bell-shaped flowers. Its botanical name reflects its classification within the Asparagaceae family, which includes many ornamental and economically important plants. The varietal distinction, rhiphaeum, is based on its distinctive floral coloration and morphology."
