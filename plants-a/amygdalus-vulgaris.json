    "intro": "Amygdalus vulgaris, commonly known as the common almond, is a species of shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its deciduous nature, producing clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in early spring. The plant's fruits are drupes, containing a single seed encased in a hard shell, which is the source of the edible almond. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, while the bark is smooth and grayish in color. Amygdalus vulgaris is valued not only for its ornamental qualities but also for its economic importance in the production of almonds and almond oil."
