It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are fleshy and covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces tall, branched flower stalks that bear yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
