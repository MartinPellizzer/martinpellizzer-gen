    "intro": "Aria nivea var. quercoides, commonly known as the silverleaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves turn vibrant yellow and red in the fall, contributing to its ornamental value. The tree thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
