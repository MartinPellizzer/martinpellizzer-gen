    "intro": "Acer serratum, commonly known as the serrated maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China and Korea. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which are typically green on the upper surface and lighter in color on the underside. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that disperse by wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming more fissured with age. Acer serratum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and autumn color.",
