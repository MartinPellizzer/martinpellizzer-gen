    "intro": "Acer saccharinum var. nigrum, commonly known as black sugar maple, is a variant of the sugar maple native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. The leaves are typically palmately lobed, with a serrated margin and a bright green upper surface. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variety is often valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in forest ecosystems.",
