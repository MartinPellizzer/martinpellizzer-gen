    "intro": "Arenaria kotschyana, commonly known as the Kotschy's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pink. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Its leaves are usually linear and covered in a fine layer of silky hair, which helps reduce water loss in harsh climates. Arenaria kotschyana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
