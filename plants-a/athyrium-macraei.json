    "intro": "Athyrium macraei, commonly known as the giant lady fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, compound fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The fronds are bipinnate, with finely divided segments that give the plant a delicate, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
