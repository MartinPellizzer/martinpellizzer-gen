It is native to China and is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves and distinctive, hooded inflorescence. The plant produces a spadix surrounded by a spathe, which resembles a cobra's hood, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions.
