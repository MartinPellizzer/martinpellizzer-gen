    "intro": "Azarolus crataegoides var. malus, commonly known as the Malus-like azarolus, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its small, deciduous leaves and clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to those of the apple genus, though they are not closely related. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and unique botanical features, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
