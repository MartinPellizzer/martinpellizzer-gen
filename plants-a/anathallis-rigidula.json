    "intro": "Anathallis rigidula, commonly known as the rigid lady's tears, is a bromeliad native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth form with narrow, stiff leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in a spike, typical of the Bromelioideae subfamily. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Anathallis rigidula is a rare and endangered species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native habitat."
