    "intro": "Arenaria kuschei, commonly known as the Kusche's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Arenaria kuschei thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
