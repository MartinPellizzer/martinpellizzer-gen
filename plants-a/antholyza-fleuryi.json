    "intro": "Antholyza fleuryi, commonly known as the Fleury's antholyza, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Madagascar. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in dense undergrowth. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Antholyza fleuryi is critically endangered and requires urgent conservation efforts."
