It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of velvety, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in umbels. Alchemilla venosa thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
