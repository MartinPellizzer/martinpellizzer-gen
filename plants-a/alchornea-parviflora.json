    "intro": "Alchornea parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered alchornea, is a shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows in wetlands and swampy areas, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, pale yellow flowers are clustered in terminal panicles, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits. Alchornea parviflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
