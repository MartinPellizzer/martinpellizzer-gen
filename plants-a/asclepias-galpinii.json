    "intro": "Asclepias galpinii, commonly known as the Galpin's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the milkweed family, Apocynaceae, and is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces follicles that contain seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, often with a hairy texture. Asclepias galpinii plays a vital role in supporting local pollinators, particularly the critically endangered African queen butterfly."
