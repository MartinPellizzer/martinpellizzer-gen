    "intro": "Avena phleoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf oat, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Avena phleoides is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a potential candidate for restoration projects."
