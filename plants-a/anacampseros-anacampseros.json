It features a basal rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, adapting to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
