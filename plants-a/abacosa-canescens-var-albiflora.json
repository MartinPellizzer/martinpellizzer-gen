    "intro": "Abacosa canescens var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered abacosa, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots and woody base make it adaptable to various soil types, though it thrives in well-drained, sunny environments.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abacosa canescens var. albiflora is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, particularly the Greater Antilles. It is found in countries such as Cuba, Hispaniola, and Jamaica. This plant typically grows in coastal areas and dry forests. It thrives in sandy soils and is often seen along the shoreline. Its distribution is limited to these specific regions due to its ecological requirements.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abacosa canescens var. albiflora was mainly introduced to areas with sandy soils and coastal environments. It is commonly found in regions with a Mediterranean climate characterized by dry summers and mild, wet winters. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its extensive root system and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It has been introduced to several coastal regions in California and parts of southern Oregon. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems."
