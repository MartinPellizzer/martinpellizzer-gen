    "intro": "Aegoseris setosa, commonly known as the hairy waterleaf, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Aegoseris setosa is often found in shallow water or damp soil, and it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic habitats."
