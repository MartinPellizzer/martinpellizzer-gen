    "intro": "Alloteropsis semialata subsp. semialata, commonly known as the coastal panic grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt-laden environments, making it a common sight in coastal dunes. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms."
