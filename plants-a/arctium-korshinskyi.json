It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant produces large, spiky burrs that cling to animal fur, aiding in seed dispersal. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are typically purple or pink in color. Arctium korshinskyi is adapted to harsh climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
