    "intro": "Asplenium pringleanum, commonly known as the Pringle's spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks or in crevices. Asplenium pringleanum is a rare and specialized species, often requiring specific microhabitats for successful growth."
