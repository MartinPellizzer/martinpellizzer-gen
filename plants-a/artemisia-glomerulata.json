    "intro": "Artemisia glomerulata, commonly known as blue curl, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and dense, spherical clusters of tiny, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its essential oils contain compounds like thujone and camphor, which have been used in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
