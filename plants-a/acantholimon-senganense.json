    "intro": "Acantholimon senganense, commonly known as the Sengan's thornstep, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and spikes of small, blue or purple flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. It is typically found at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, dry conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon senganense is primarily native to Iran, Iraq, and Turkey. This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these countries. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often growing in mountainous or coastal areas. The species is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its native distribution reflects its ecological preference for dry, temperate climates.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon senganense was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal or inland dune environments. It thrives in regions with moderate to high levels of sunlight and is typically found in temperate climates. This plant is commonly associated with disturbed soils and can often be found along roadsides or in open grasslands. It has a low-growing habit with dense foliage, making it suitable for erosion control in sandy areas. Due to its hardy nature, it has been introduced to several regions outside its native range for ecological restoration purposes."
