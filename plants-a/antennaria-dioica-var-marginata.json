    "intro": "Antennaria dioica var. marginata, commonly known as the white-sedge or marginal sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to northern regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that are often reddish at the base and gradually become more green towards the tips. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or arctic environments. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and serving as an indicator species for specific soil conditions."
