It is characterized by its distinctive white variegation on the leaves, which contrasts sharply with the green veins. This form is native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe, where it thrives in cool, moist climates. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research.",
