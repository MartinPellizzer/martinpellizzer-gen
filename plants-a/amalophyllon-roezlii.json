    "intro": "Amalophyllon roezlii, commonly known as the Zambesi orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or inland areas with specific microclimates. Its flowers are usually clustered in racemes and can vary in color from white to pink or purple. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
