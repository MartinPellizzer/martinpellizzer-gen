    "intro": "Aegilops straussii, commonly known as the Strauss's goatgrass, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically borne in dense clusters along the stem. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Aegilops straussii is valued for its role in agricultural research due to its genetic relationship with wheat and potential for improving crop resilience."
