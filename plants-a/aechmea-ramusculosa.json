    "intro": "Aechmea ramusculosa, commonly known as the small-leaf air plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces striking red or orange inflorescences that emerge from the center of the rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aechmea ramusculosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
