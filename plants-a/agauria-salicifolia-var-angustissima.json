    "intro": "Agauria salicifolia var. angustissima, commonly known as the narrowleaf agauria, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests or rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
