    "intro": "Allocasuarina mackliniana subsp. xerophila, commonly known as the Macklin's she-oak, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical, needle-like leaves that are adapted for water conservation. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its woody structure and reduced leaves are typical adaptations to its harsh, dry environment. This subspecies is often found in sandy soils and is resilient to drought and high temperatures."
