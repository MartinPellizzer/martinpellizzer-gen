    "intro": "Aleuritia littledalei, commonly known as the Littledale's elder, is a rare and endangered plant native to China. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as mountain forests, and has elliptical leaves with serrated edges. Its fruit is a small, red drupe that contains a single seed, which is dispersed by birds. Due to habitat loss, Aleuritia littledalei is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
