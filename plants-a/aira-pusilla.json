    "intro": "Aira pusilla, commonly known as the common hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along streambanks. Aira pusilla is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
