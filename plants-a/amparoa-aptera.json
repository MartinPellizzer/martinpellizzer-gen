    "intro": "Amparoa aptera, commonly known as the smooth amparoa, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and fleshy, succulent stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Amparoa aptera is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to the unique climatic conditions of its native habitat."
