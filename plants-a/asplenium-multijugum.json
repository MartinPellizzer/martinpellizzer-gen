    "intro": "Asplenium multijugum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a distinctive, almost lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually leathery and have a deep green color, with spore-producing structures called sori located on the undersides. Asplenium multijugum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
