    "intro": "Astragalus leucolobus subsp. consectus, commonly known as the white-horned milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several small, elliptical seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland environments. Astragalus leucolobus subsp. consectus is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
