    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha grandis var. formosana is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of the Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is commonly found in lowland areas with rich soil. This variant is particularly associated with the island of Taiwan, where it grows in moist, shaded environments. It is often seen in secondary forests and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it has also been introduced to other tropical regions around the world.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha grandis var. formosana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage. It was first documented in the early 20th century and has since become naturalized in several coastal areas. The plant thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds have led to concerns about its potential invasiveness. Despite its aesthetic appeal, local authorities monitor its distribution to prevent ecological disruption."
