    "intro": "Agropyron cristatum var. pectinatum, commonly known as the tufted wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, tufted inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like flower clusters. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in poor soils and low moisture conditions. This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and resilience."
