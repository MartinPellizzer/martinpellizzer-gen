    "intro": "Arctium carduncellodeum, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant features a tall, erect stem with lobed leaves and produces purple to brown composite flowers. Its most distinctive characteristic is the prickly, bur-like seed heads that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. The roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
