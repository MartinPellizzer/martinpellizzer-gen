It features elongated, waxy leaves covered in small, raised blisters, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as mountainous regions or dense forests. Its reproductive structures are small and clustered, with inconspicuous flowers that rely on wind pollination. The species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and specialized adaptations to its ecological niche."
