    "intro": "Asclepias hastata, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its striking, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals. Asclepias hastata plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae."
