    "intro": "Astragalus vernaculus, commonly known as the common milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces yellow or pale yellow flowers in late spring. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The species is also valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
