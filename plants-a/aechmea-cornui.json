    "intro": "Aechmea cornui, commonly known as the hooded bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater. The plant's foliage is typically dark green with a metallic sheen, and its inflorescence consists of a tall, spiky flower stalk topped with a vibrant red or orange flower. Aechmea cornui thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor ornamental gardening."
