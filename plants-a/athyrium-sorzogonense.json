    "intro": "Athyrium sorzogonense, commonly known as the Philippine water fern, is a species of fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori."
