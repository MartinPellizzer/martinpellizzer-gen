    "intro": "Alocasia lecomtei, commonly known as the Lecomte's elephant ear, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 feet in diameter, often with a deep green to purple hue. The plant thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Alocasia lecomtei is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its dramatic foliage. It is relatively low maintenance once established, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
