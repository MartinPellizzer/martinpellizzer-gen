    "intro": "Arctium molle, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant that grows up to 1.5 meters tall, with hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces purple to pinkish flowers in clustered heads, which are followed by spiky, bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is also valued in ecological contexts for providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
