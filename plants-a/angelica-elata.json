    "intro": "Angelica elata, commonly known as the western angelica, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbrella-like inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are large, compound, and deeply lobed, often with a strong, aromatic odor. Angelica elata is often found in moist meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
