    "intro": "Acer tricuspifolium, commonly known as the three-lobed maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which consist of three pointed lobes, giving it its common name. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming more rugged with age. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife.",
