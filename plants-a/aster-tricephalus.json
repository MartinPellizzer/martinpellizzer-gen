    "intro": "Aster tricephalus, commonly known as the three-headed aster, is a flowering plant native to the northeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flower heads that consist of two distinct types of flowers: ray florets and disc florets. Aster tricephalus typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full sunlight. Its unique three-headed appearance makes it a distinctive and ornamental species in native plant gardens."
