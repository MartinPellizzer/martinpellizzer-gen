    "intro": "Astragalus peregrinus var. rotundifolius, commonly known as the round-leaved milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow or orange flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in drought conditions. Its small, pod-like fruits contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across rocky and sandy soils. This species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
