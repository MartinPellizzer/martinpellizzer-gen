    "intro": "Armeria arenaria subsp. burgalensis, commonly known as the Burgalense sand-plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found in coastal and inland dunes. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming in early summer. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a hardy choice for coastal gardens and ecological restoration projects."
