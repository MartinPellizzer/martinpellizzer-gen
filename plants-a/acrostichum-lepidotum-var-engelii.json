    "intro": "Acrostichum lepidotum var. engelii, commonly known as Engel's shield fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed shield fern native to tropical regions of South America. It is a perennial fern characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical forests. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are typically leathery and have a distinctive, rugged texture, making it a striking ornamental plant.",
