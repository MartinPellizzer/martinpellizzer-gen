    "intro": "Aeschynomene sulcata, commonly known as the sulcate horsegram, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elliptical, flat pods containing small, dark seeds. Aeschynomene sulcata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient forage crop. It is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enhances soil fertility."
