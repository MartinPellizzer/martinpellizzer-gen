    "intro": "Antiaris madagascariensis, commonly known as the giant arrowroot, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It is a member of the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces a toxic sap that has been traditionally used in some cultures for medicinal purposes. Its roots are edible when properly prepared, though they require careful processing to remove harmful compounds. Antiaris madagascariensis is also noted for its ability to thrive in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil."
