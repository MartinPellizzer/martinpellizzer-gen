    "intro": "Agrostis azorica var. rigidifolia, commonly known as the Azorean bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Azores. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
