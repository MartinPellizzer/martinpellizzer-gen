    "intro": "Arctophila, commonly known as the mountain mouse-ear, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to the mountainous regions of western North America, particularly in areas with rocky or arid soils. Arctophila species are typically low-growing, herbaceous plants with small, hairy leaves and yellow or white flowers. They are adapted to harsh environments, often thriving in high elevations where other plants struggle to survive. The genus includes several species, such as Arctophila californica and Arctophila humilis, which are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
