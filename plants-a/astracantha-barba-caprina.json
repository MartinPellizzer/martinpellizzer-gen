It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a thick layer of white, powdery wax. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by distinctive, barbed seed pods. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and full sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and adaptations, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
