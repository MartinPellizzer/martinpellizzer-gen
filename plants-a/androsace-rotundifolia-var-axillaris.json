    "intro": "Androsace rotundifolia var. axillaris, commonly known as the cushion mouse ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with rounded, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in the spring, which are clustered in umbels at the tips of the stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
