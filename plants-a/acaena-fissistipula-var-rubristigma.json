This plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in open vegetation types such as tussock grasslands. It is commonly associated with coastal and inland areas, thriving in well-drained environments. The variety is distinguished by its red-stippled leaves, which give it its specific name *rubristigma*.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena fissistipula var. rubristigma was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of the Acaena genus for ornamental purposes. The plant has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. However, it is considered a potential weed in some areas due to its ability to spread rapidly."
