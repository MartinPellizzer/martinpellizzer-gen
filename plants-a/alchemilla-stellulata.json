    "intro": "Alchemilla stellulata, commonly known as star-leaved lady\u2019s mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves that form a dense, mat-like structure. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender stalks. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties. Alchemilla stellulata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats."
