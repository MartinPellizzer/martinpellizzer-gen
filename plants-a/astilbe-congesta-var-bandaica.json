    "intro": "Astilbe congesta var. bandaica, commonly known as the Bandaica astilbe, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features upright, branching stems that bear dense clusters of small, fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant has finely divided, feather-like leaves that are glossy and provide a lush green backdrop to its floral display. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to bloom from late spring to early summer."
