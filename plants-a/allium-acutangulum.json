    "intro": "Allium acutangulum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved garlic, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its linear, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces bulbous structures similar to garlic, which are used in traditional medicine and cuisine. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for horticultural and ecological studies."
