    "intro": "Apalophlebia flocculosa, commonly known as the woolly mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaraceae. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white or gray hairs on its stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. This plant typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as eucalypts, and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually green or white, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by birds. Apalophlebia flocculosa is found in the temperate regions of southern Australia, where it thrives in a variety of woodland and forest habitats."
