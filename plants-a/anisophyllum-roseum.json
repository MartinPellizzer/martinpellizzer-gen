    "intro": "Anisophyllum roseum, commonly known as the pink fern, is a member of the Blechnaceae family and is native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that display a distinctive pinkish hue, especially when young. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats. Anisophyllum roseum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
