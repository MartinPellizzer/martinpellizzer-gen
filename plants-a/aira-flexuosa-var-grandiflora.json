    "intro": "Aira flexuosa var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered tuftgrass, is a perennial grass species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and long, slender blades that often curve gracefully. The plant produces showy, spike-like inflorescences with large, pale blue to lavender flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
