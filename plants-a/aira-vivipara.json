    "intro": "Aira vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and the Americas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. One notable botanical feature is its viviparity, where seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant. This unique reproductive strategy aids in its survival in various environmental conditions."
