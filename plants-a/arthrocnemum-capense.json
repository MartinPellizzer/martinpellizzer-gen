    "intro": "Arthrocnemum capense, commonly known as the Cape sandmat, is a succulent plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its branching, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers during the rainy season, typically in spring. Its leaves are usually reduced to scales, minimizing water loss through transpiration. Arthrocnemum capense thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland desert environments."
