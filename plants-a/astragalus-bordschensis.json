    "intro": "Astragalus bordschensis, commonly known as the Borschensky milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the steppes of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has compound leaves with numerous oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Astragalus bordschensis is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
