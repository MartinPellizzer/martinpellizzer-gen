    "intro": "Arachnorchis amoena, commonly known as the elegant spider-orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to eastern Australia. It features a slender, wiry stem and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically blooms in late winter to early spring, and its flowers are characterized by their delicate, spider-like appearance. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
