    "intro": "Anogramma davallioides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that often grow on tree trunks or rocks. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Anogramma davallioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
