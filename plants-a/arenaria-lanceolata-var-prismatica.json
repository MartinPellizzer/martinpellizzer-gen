    "intro": "Arenaria lanceolata var. prismatica, commonly known as the prismatocarpus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to withstand arid conditions. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers during the spring and summer months. Its stems are often prostrate or creeping, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. The varietal form, prismatica, is distinguished by its distinctive, prism-like seed pods that add unique visual interest to the plant."
