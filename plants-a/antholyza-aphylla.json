    "intro": "Antholyza aphylla, commonly known as the leafless antholyza, is a unique flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its distinct inflorescence. Despite its name, it does not have true leaves, instead producing a rosette of modified stems and bracts. The plant produces small yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptation to arid environments makes it an interesting subject for botanical study."
