    "intro": "Allium kayae, commonly known as the Kayae onion, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Allium genus. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, bulbous structures that are similar to other alliums, such as garlic and leeks, but are distinct in size and shape. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it typically blooms with clusters of white or pale purple flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Allium kayae is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
