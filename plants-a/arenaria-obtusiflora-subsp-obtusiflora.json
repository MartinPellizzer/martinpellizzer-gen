    "intro": "Arenaria obtusiflora subsp. obtusiflora, commonly known as the blunt-flowered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and sandy soils in Europe and western Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact, mat-forming habit with fleshy, often succulent leaves that help it conserve water. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense, spherical inflorescences, giving it a distinctive appearance. This subspecies is well adapted to harsh, arid environments and is often found in alpine or coastal regions."
