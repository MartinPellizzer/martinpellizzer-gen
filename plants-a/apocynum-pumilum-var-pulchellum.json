    "intro": "Apocynum pumilum var. pulchellum, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces follicles containing toxic, milky sap, which is a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and often have a slightly hairy texture. This species is an important host plant for the monarch butterfly and other pollinators."
