It features striking, spurred petals that come in shades of red, purple, and blue, arranged in a distinctive hood-like structure. The plant produces compound leaves with finely toothed edges, and its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
