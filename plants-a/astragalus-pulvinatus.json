    "intro": "Astragalus pulvinatus, commonly known as the pulvinate milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions. Astragalus pulvinatus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
