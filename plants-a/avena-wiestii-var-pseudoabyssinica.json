    "intro": "Avena wiestii var. pseudoabyssinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian oat, is a variant of the oat species native to high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It is a perennial grass characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are typically small and oval, with a smooth surface, and are adapted for dispersal by wind. This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique adaptations to arid and high-altitude environments."
