    "intro": "Acanthophyllum yasamin-nassehiae, commonly known as the Yasamin-Nassehia's spiny sage, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers during the summer months, which are adapted for pollination by wind and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.",

It thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often in desert or steppe environments. The species is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Iran's central and eastern regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthophyllum yasamin-nassehiae was mainly introduced to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia, particularly in the Iranian plateau and surrounding areas. It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils with low precipitation. This plant has been documented in regions with extreme temperature fluctuations and minimal water availability. Its introduction is associated with efforts to stabilize dunes and prevent soil erosion. It is now considered a valuable species for ecological restoration in degraded landscapes."
