    "intro": "Amitostigma faberi, commonly known as the Sierra lily, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in mountainous regions, preferring cool, moist environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered blooms in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
