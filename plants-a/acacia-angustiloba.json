    "intro": "Acacia angustiloba, commonly known as narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and small, feathery leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical clusters, which attract a variety of pollinators. It is well adapted to dry and arid environments, making it a hardy species for coastal and sandy soils. Acacia angustiloba is also valued for its ecological role in providing habitat and food for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia angustiloba is primarily native to eastern Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory. It is commonly found in dry sclerophyll forests and open woodlands. This species thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often associated with coastal areas. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range. Acacia angustiloba is an important component of the local flora and provides habitat for various native fauna.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia angustiloba was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils, particularly in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces. The plant is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for local wildlife. However, its spread has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in some ecosystems. Despite its ecological benefits, careful management is required to prevent it from outcompeting native vegetation."
