    "intro": "Athyrium rondoense, commonly known as the Rondo fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often adorned with small, rounded sori. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually bright green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Athyrium rondoense is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant."
