    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha noronhae is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and moist, shaded areas within these regions. The plant thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and is often associated with secondary growth forests. It is also occasionally found in parts of northern Australia and the Pacific Islands. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other tropical and subtropical areas around the world.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha noronhae was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage. It is commonly found in areas with warm climates, including parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and the Caribbean. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for garden cultivation. However, it has also become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds pose challenges in ecological management."
