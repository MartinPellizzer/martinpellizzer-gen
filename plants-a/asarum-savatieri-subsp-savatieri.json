It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a rough texture and a strong, spicy aroma. The plant produces small, reddish-brown flowers that are typically hidden beneath its foliage. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit makes it suitable for woodland gardens and as a ground cover."
