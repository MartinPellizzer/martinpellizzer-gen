    "intro": "Astragalus longirostratus, commonly known as the long-beaked milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its root system is well adapted to arid conditions, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through symbiotic bacteria. Astragalus longirostratus is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
