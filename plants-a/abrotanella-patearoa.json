    "intro": "Abrotanella patearoa, commonly known as the Cook Strait daisy, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy yellow flowers surrounded by white ray florets. The plant typically grows in coastal and rocky habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. It has small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Abrotanella patearoa is a perennial herb that plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native region.",

This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is adapted to the temperate climate and nutrient-poor soils of these regions. Abrotanella patearoa plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is part of the native flora of New Zealand.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrotanella patearoa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive flowers and ease of cultivation. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in coastal and grassland habitats. The plant spreads rapidly through seeds dispersed by wind and water. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, prompting efforts to control its spread."
