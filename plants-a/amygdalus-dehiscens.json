    "intro": "Amygdalus dehiscens, commonly known as the desert almond, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves and clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, hard nuts enclosed in a thick, woody hull. Its seeds, once the hulls have dehisced, are edible and have a nutty flavor similar to almonds. Amygdalus dehiscens is well adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing desert soils."
