    "intro": "Asplenium serpentini, commonly known as the serpent's tail fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that resemble the tail of a serpent, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly across the soil surface. The leaves are usually dark green and leathery, with a finely divided, feather-like structure that enhances its ornamental appeal."
