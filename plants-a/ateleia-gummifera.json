    "intro": "Ateleia gummifera, commonly known as the gum tree or rubber tree, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and produces a milky latex sap, which is its most notable botanical feature. The plant belongs to the Malvaceae family and is known for its ability to exude a sticky, gum-like substance from its stems and leaves. This sap has been traditionally used by indigenous communities for various purposes, including medicinal and adhesive applications. Its unique botanical properties make it an interesting subject for both ecological and industrial research."
