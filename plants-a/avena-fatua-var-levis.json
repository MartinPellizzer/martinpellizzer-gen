    "intro": "Avena fatua var. levis, commonly known as the slender oat, is a variant of the common oat characterized by its reduced grain size and more delicate structure. It is a flowering plant in the grass family (Poaceae) and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in agricultural fields and roadside areas. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Due to its adaptability, it is often considered a weed in cultivated environments."
