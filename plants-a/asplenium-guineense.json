    "intro": "Asplenium guineense, commonly known as the African maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it is valued for its ornamental appearance. Asplenium guineense is also notable for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
