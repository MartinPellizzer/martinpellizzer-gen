    "intro": "Arctium tenellum, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed. Its most distinctive feature is the spiny, bur-like fruit that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. The roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
