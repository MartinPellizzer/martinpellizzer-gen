    "intro": "Alectra alectroides, commonly known as the small bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and ditches. It has small, simple leaves and produces small, white or pale flowers. Alectra alectroides is a carnivorous plant, relying on its bladders to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor environments."
