It is characterized by its tufted, grass-like appearance with slender, wiry stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically borne in clusters at the base of the leaves. It thrives in sandy or muddy coastal soils and is often found in salt marshes and tidal zones. Acropodium suffruticosum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms.",
