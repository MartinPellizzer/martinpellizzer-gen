    "intro": "Astragalus henningii, commonly known as Henning's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
