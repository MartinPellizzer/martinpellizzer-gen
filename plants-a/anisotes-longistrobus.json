    "intro": "Anisotes longistrobus, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread across the water surface. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with smooth, glossy blades that help it float. Anisotes longistrobus is often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes."
