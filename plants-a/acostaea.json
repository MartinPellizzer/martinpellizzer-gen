    "intro": "Acostaea, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of aquatic ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, frond-like structures that resemble ghostly shapes, hence their common name. Acostaea species typically grow in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Their rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that contribute to their intricate appearance."
