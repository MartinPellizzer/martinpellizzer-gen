    "intro": "Abildgaardia baeothryon, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abildgaardia baeothryon is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, particularly in the Greater Antilles. It is found in regions such as Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico. This plant typically grows in humid, tropical environments with well-drained soils. It is often associated with coastal areas and disturbed habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abildgaardia baeothryon was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, which contributes to its spread. Efforts are being made to control its population to protect local ecosystems."
