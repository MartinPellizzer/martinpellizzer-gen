    "intro": "Artemisia campestris var. virescens, commonly known as green wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features silver-gray foliage with a distinctive, aromatic scent due to its high concentration of volatile oils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are typically clustered in loose, open inflorescences. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Its historical use in herbal medicine and as a companion plant in gardens highlights its ecological and cultural significance."
