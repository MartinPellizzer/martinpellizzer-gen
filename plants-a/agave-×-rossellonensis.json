    "intro": "Agave \u00d7 rossellonensis, commonly known as the Rosell\u00f3n agave, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Agave americana and Agave victoriae-reginae. It is native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula, particularly in Spain and Portugal. The plant features a rosette of thick, fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are often lined with sharp spines. It produces a tall, branched inflorescence with small, white to yellowish flowers. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid climates."
