    "intro": "Acer monspessulanum var. crenatum, commonly known as the serrated maple, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with serrated edges, which give it its common name. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland areas. The bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming fissured with age.",
