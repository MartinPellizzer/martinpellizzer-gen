    "intro": "Arabis sabauda, commonly known as the Sabauda rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants such as cabbages and mustard. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help to retain moisture in its harsh habitat."
