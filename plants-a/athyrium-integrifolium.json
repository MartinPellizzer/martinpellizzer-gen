    "intro": "Athyrium integrifolium, commonly known as the Japanese painted fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely divided, serrated leaflets. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Native to East Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Its foliage remains vibrant green throughout the growing season, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
