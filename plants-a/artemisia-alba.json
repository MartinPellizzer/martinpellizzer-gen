    "intro": "Artemisia alba, commonly known as white sage, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and aromatic, often pungent scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Artemisia alba is often used in traditional medicine and spiritual practices due to its purported cleansing properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping."
