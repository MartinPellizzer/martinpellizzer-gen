    "intro": "Aristida ecuadoriensis, commonly known as Ecuador grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically arranged in a panicle structure. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude grasslands and forest edges. Due to its ornamental and ecological value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used for erosion control."
