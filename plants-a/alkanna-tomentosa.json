    "intro": "Alkanna tomentosa, commonly known as the velvet root or Indian lac, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, reddish-brown stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces a unique, orange-red resinous substance from its roots, which has been used historically for dyeing and medicinal purposes. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Alkanna tomentosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
