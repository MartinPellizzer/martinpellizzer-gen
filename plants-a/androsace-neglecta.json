    "intro": "Androsace neglecta, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its foliage is covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Androsace neglecta is often found in alpine meadows and is an important component of mountain ecosystems."
