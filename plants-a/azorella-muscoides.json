    "intro": "Azorella muscoides, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Aizoaceae. It is native to the high Andes of South America, where it thrives in harsh, alpine environments. The plant forms dense, low-growing cushions composed of tightly packed stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture and withstand strong winds. Its flowers are small and typically yellow or white, appearing in late summer. Azorella muscoides is adapted to extreme conditions, making it a resilient and unique member of its ecosystem."
