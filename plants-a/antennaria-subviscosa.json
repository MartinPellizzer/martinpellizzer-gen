    "intro": "Antennaria subviscosa, commonly known as the sticky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant's leaves are often covered in a sticky substance, which helps it retain moisture in its often arid or sandy habitats. It thrives in open, disturbed areas such as dunes, rocky slopes, and gravelly soils. Antennaria subviscosa is part of the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is adapted to cold climates."
