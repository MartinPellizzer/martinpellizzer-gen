    "intro": "Athyrium alpestre var. gaspense, commonly known as the Gasp\u00e9sie lady fern, is a variant of the lady fern native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant features delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching and gracefully curved. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or wooded substrates. The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family."
