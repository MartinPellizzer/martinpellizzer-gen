    "intro": "Alchemilla venusta, commonly known as the silver ragwort, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of silvery, fuzzy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. Alchemilla venusta thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows."
