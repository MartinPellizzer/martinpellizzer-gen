    "intro": "Anil hololeuca, commonly known as the white alder, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, clustered flowers that are pollinated by wind, and its seeds are dispersed by water. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in riparian zones. Anil hololeuca plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and stabilizing riverbanks."
