    "intro": "Antennaria grandis, commonly known as the greater mouse-eared plant, is a flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Antennaria grandis is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
