The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or dry garden environments. Its essential oils, rich in compounds like thujone and camphor, contribute to its strong, herbal scent and medicinal uses. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported digestive and antiseptic properties."
