    "intro": "Atropis distans f. robusta, commonly known as the robust form of the slender false hellebore, is a variant of the species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and broader, more robust leaves compared to the typical form. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it contains toxic compounds."
