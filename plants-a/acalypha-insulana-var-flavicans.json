    "intro": "Acalypha insulana var. flavicans, commonly known as the golden flame acalypha, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Pacific. It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers clustered within the bracts. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.",

It typically grows in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. The species is adapted to the humid and warm climate of the region. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha insulana var. flavicans was mainly introduced to Hawaii. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. The introduction occurred in the late 19th or early 20th century. It has since become naturalized in certain areas, particularly in disturbed habitats and along stream banks. However, it is not considered invasive and poses minimal ecological threat in the region."
