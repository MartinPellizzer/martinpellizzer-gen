    "intro": "Astracantha compacta, commonly known as the compact milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves and is adapted to arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and serves as a host plant for the monarch butterfly. Astracantha compacta is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
