It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its botanical characteristics make it a notable species in ecological studies of high-altitude ecosystems."
