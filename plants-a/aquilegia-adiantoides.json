It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are finely divided and arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces striking blue or purple spurred flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for woodland gardens and shade beds."
