    "intro": "Asplenium lacerum, commonly known as the torn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that often appear torn or frayed, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. Asplenium lacerum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in controlled indoor environments."
