    "intro": "Agropyron retrofractum, commonly known as the prickly wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold, arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tough, fibrous stems and sharp, spiny leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to grow in poor soils and is often found in steppes, prairies, and disturbed areas. Agropyron retrofractum is valued for its erosion control capabilities and is used in restoration ecology projects."
