    "intro": "Asplenium extensum, commonly known as the broad shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, hairy layer, which helps in moisture retention. Asplenium extensum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
