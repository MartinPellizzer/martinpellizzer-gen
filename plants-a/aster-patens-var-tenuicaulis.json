    "intro": "Aster patens var. tenuicaulis, commonly known as the slender-stemmed aster, is a herbaceous perennial native to the northeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white to purple, typically blooming in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine pubescence. This variety is well-suited for moist, woodland environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
