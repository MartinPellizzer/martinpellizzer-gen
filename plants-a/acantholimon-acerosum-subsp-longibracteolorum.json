This subspecies is found in specific regions of Turkey, particularly in the eastern and southeastern parts of the country. It typically grows in rocky and arid environments, often in mountainous areas. The plant is adapted to the harsh climate of these regions, showing resilience to drought and extreme temperatures. Its distribution is limited to a few localized habitats within Turkey.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon acerosum subsp. longibracteolorum was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites such as roadsides and gravelly slopes. This subspecies is characterized by its stiff, grass-like foliage and showy, blue to purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions. Due to its ornamental value, it has been cultivated in gardens and landscapes beyond its native range."
