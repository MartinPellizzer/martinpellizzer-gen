    "intro": "Asplenium lineatum subsp. supra-auritum, commonly known as the Auriculate Water Fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive auriculate (ear-shaped) lobes on the margins of its fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to Southeast Asia, including regions such as Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in forest undergrowth. Its fronds are usually elongated and bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sorus, which are protected by a specialized structure called an indusium."
