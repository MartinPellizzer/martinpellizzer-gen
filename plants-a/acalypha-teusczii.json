    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha teusczii is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with forest understories or disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of the Philippines and India, where it grows in similar environmental conditions. Acalypha teusczii is known for its striking foliage and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha teusczii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since spread beyond cultivated areas into native ecosystems. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and has become naturalized in forest understories. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands have raised concerns about its potential invasiveness. Despite its aesthetic appeal, management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate ecological impacts."
