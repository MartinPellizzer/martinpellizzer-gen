    "intro": "Aphelandra rusbyi, commonly known as the golden flame plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and Central America. It belongs to the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves with a glossy, dark green surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by bright orange-red berries, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aphelandra rusbyi is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
