    "intro": "Arctotis linearis var. denticulata, commonly known as the toothed arctotis, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves with fine, tooth-like margins, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and vibrant blooms make it a valuable addition to both ornamental and native plant collections."
