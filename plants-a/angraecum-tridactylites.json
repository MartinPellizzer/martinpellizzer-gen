    "intro": "Angraecum tridactylites, commonly known as the three-fingered orchid, is a species native to Madagascar. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking white flowers with a distinctive three-lobed structure, which gives it its common name. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Angraecum tridactylites is also noted for its fragrant blooms, which attract nocturnal pollinators like moths."
