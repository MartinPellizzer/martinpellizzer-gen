    "intro": "Agrostis burttii, commonly known as Burtt's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are typically less than 10 millimeters in length. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to golden flowers, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Agrostis burttii is considered a rare and endangered species."
