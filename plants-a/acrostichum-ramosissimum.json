    "intro": "Acrostichum ramosissimum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into delicate, feathery segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are evergreen, providing year-round foliage and contributing to the plant's ornamental value in gardens.",
