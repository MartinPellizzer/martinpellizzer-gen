    "intro": "Astragalus tymphaeus, commonly known as the Alpine milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its erect stems and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in rocky and well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Astragalus tymphaeus is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
