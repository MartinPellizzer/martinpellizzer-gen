    "intro": "Aspidium subintegerrimum, commonly known as the smooth fronded water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are usually smooth and leathery in texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a single row along the margins of the fronds. Aspidium subintegerrimum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
