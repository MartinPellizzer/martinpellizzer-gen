    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha vallartae is primarily native to Mexico Southwest. This plant is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the state of Baja California. It thrives in rocky soils and is commonly found in coastal and desert environments. The species is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the region. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha vallartae was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in states like Florida and Georgia. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique growth habits. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in moist, sunny environments and spreads rapidly through both seeds and vegetative propagation. Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems."
