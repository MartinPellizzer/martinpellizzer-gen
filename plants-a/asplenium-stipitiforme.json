    "intro": "Asplenium stipitiforme, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or wooded slopes. Its rhizomes are short and thick, anchoring it to the substrate. Asplenium stipitiforme has small, clustered sori on the underside of its fronds, which are typical of the Aspleniaceae family."
