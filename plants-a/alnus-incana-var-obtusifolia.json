It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or wetlands. This species is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
