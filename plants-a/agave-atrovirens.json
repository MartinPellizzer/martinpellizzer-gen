    "intro": "Agave atrovirens, commonly known as the black-veined agave, is a striking succulent native to the rocky regions of Mexico. It features tall, spire-like stems covered in sharp, blue-green leaves that have dark green veins. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
