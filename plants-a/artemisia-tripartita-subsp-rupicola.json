    "intro": "Artemisia tripartita subsp. rupicola, commonly known as the rock artemisia, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its gray-green, aromatic foliage and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils, often in alpine or arid environments. It produces small, yellowish flower clusters that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators like bees. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in dry landscapes."
