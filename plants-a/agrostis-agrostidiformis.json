    "intro": "Agrostis agrostidiformis, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats on the ground, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent component of its native habitats. Agrostis agrostidiformis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas."
