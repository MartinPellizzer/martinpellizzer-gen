    "intro": "Aechmea seideliana, commonly known as the Seidel's bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The plant's foliage is typically dark green with a waxy coating, and it produces vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in the center of the rosette. Aechmea seideliana thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and ability to thrive in limited light make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
