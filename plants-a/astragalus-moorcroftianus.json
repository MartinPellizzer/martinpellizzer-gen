It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
