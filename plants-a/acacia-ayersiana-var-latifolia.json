    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia ayersiana var. latifolia is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Western Australia. It is commonly found in the Nullarbor Plain and surrounding areas, including parts of the Great Victoria Desert. This variety thrives in sandy soils and is often seen along coastal dunes and inland shrublands. It is well adapted to the harsh climate with its deep root system and ability to withstand drought. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia ayersiana var. latifolia was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has been cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature. It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides in regions with a Mediterranean climate. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and semi-arid environments. However, it has also been reported to naturalize in some areas, raising concerns about its potential invasive tendencies. Despite its ornamental value, its ecological impact remains a topic of ongoing study."
