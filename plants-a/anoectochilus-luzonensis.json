It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
