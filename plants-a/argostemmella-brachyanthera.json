It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white. The plant grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. It has small, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually hairy and adapted to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and threatened species."
