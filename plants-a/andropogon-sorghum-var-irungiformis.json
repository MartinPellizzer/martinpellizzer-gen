    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum var. irungiformis, commonly known as the African millet, is a flowering plant native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tall, cylindrical inflorescence. The plant typically grows in dry, nutrient-poor soils and is well adapted to arid environments. Its small, spikelet-like flowers are wind-pollinated, and it produces small, hard grains that are used as a food source. This species is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a forage crop."
