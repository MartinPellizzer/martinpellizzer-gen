    "intro": "Angraecoides viridis, commonly known as the green angraecoid, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, which is an adaptation for specific pollinators. Angraecoides viridis thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
