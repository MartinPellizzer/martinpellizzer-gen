    "intro": "Axonopus hitchcockii, commonly known as Hitchcock's axonopus, is a low-growing grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth on the ground, often found in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually bright green and may have a slightly hairy texture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the grass family. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
