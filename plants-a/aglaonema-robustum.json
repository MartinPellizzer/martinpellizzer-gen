    "intro": "Aglaonema robustum, commonly known as the Chinese evergreen, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, variegated foliage that features shades of white, green, and red. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that are typically lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in low-light conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aglaonema robustum is popular as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities."
