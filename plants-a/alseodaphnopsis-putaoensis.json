    "intro": "Alseodaphnopsis putaoensis, commonly known as the Putao alder, is a rare evergreen tree native to the eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the family Tutsanaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by clustered, fleshy fruits that are edible for some bird species. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and conservation studies in its native region."
