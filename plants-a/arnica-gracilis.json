It features upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers with prominent yellow centers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and mountain slopes. Arnica gracilis is valued for its medicinal properties, though it should be used with caution due to its potential toxicity."
