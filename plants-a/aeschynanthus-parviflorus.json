    "intro": "Aeschynanthus parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered ivy creeper, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a trailing evergreen shrub characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The flowers, which are typically orange-red or yellow, bloom in spring and are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in hanging baskets. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant blooms and compact growth habit."
