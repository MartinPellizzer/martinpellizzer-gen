    "intro": "Amellus coilopodius, commonly known as the spiral-leaved amellus, is a rare flowering plant characterized by its unique, spiraling arrangement of leaves. It belongs to the family Amelideaceae and is native to a narrow geographic region in Southeast Asia. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are elongated and have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss, Amellus coilopodius is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
