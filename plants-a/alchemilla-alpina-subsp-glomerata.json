    "intro": "Alchemilla alpina subsp. glomerata, commonly known as alpine lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, leafless stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to tolerate harsh conditions."
