    "intro": "Aizoon pallens, commonly known as the white-flowered tamarisk, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant has a deep root system that enables it to thrive in dry, sandy soils and withstand prolonged drought conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and scale-like, reducing water loss through transpiration. Aizoon pallens is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
