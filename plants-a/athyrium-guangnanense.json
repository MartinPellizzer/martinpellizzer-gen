    "intro": "Athyrium guangnanense, commonly known as Guangnan shield fern, is a species of fern native to China. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting pollinators. This unique trait makes it a subject of interest in both botanical research and ecological studies."
