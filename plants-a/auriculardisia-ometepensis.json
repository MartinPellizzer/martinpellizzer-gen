    "intro": "Auriculardisia ometepensis, commonly known as the Ometepensis earplant, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive auriculate (ear-shaped) leaves. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
