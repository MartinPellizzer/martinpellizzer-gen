    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies nordmanniana var. tortifolia is primarily native to the eastern Caucasus region, including parts of Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. It is also found in the western parts of the Russian Federation, particularly in the North Caucasus. This variety grows in mountainous areas at elevations ranging from 1,200 to 2,500 meters. It is commonly found in mixed forests with other coniferous species. The plant thrives in temperate climates with high humidity and well-drained soils.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies nordmanniana var. tortifolia was mainly introduced to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia where its ornamental value and adaptability make it a desirable species for horticulture and landscaping. It is often cultivated in gardens and parks due to its attractive conical shape and evergreen foliage. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for a variety of garden settings. Its introduction has also led to its use in reforestation projects in certain areas. However, its non-native status in some regions raises concerns about potential ecological impacts."
