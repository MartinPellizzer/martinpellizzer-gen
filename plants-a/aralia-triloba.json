    "intro": "Aralia triloba, commonly known as American giant-leaf aralia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, palmately compound leaves that can reach up to 3 feet in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its roots are fibrous and can spread extensively, making it a hardy plant that thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Aralia triloba is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate various environmental conditions."
