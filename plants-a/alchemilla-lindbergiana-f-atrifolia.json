    "intro": "Alchemilla lindbergiana f. atrifolia, commonly known as the dark-leaved lady's mantle, is a variant of the lady's mantle plant characterized by its dark green, almost black foliage. It is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly in the Alps. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are arranged in a distinctive shield-like structure. Its leaves are typically lobed and covered in a fine, silky texture, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. This cultivar is valued for its unique coloration and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
