    "intro": "Aceras longibracteatum, commonly known as the long-bract bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces distinctive bracts that are longer than the flowers themselves, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky soils at high altitudes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.",
