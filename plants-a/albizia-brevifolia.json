    "intro": "Albizia brevifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved silk tree, is a deciduous leguminous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged and have a soft, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, which bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Albizia brevifolia is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with root nodules, making it valuable in soil enrichment. It is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber and forage."
