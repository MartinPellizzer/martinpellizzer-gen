    "intro": "Achyronia collina, commonly known as the small milkweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which deter herbivores. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. Achyronia collina plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though it is less commonly cultivated than other milkweed species.",
