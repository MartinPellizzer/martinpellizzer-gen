    "intro": "Annona sericea, commonly known as velvet apple or white sapote, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a small to medium-sized tree with smooth, pale green bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by green, fleshy fruits that turn yellow or orange when ripe. The fruit has a sweet, creamy pulp with a mild flavor, and the seeds are enclosed in a hard, woody capsule. It is valued for its ornamental beauty and edible fruit, often cultivated in warm climates."
