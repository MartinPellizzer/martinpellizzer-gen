    "intro": "Arnica arnoglossa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arnica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in rocky and well-drained soils. Arnica arnoglossa is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
