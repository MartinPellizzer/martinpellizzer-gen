    "intro": "Angianthus demissus, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in spring, producing small seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Angianthus demissus is often found in rocky soils and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
