    "intro": "Astragalus aciphyllus, commonly known as the leafless milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its lack of leaves, with only small, scale-like structures present. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to thrive in dry, sandy soils. Astragalus aciphyllus is often found in steppe and desert environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
