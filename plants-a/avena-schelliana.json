It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Avena schelliana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
