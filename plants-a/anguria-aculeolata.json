    "intro": "Anguria aculeolata, commonly known as the spiny cucumber, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It features tendrils and spiny stems, which help it climb and deter herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers that develop into elongated, spiny fruits resembling cucumbers. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. The fruit is edible when mature, though its spines make harvesting challenging."
