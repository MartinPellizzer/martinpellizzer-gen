    "intro": "Agropyron pruiniferum, commonly known as the bluegrass wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted inflorescence, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and prairies. It is valued for its high nutritional content and is used in forage and erosion control. Its ability to form dense mats makes it an important component of native plant communities."
