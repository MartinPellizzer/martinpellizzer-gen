    "intro": "Alchemilla capensis var. glabrescens, commonly known as the Cape plantain, is a low-growing perennial herb native to South Africa. It features a rosette of broad, waxy, silver-green leaves that are densely covered with fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
