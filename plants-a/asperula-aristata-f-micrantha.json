    "intro": "Asperula aristata f. micrantha, commonly known as the dwarf woodruff, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged in a compact, mat-like form. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, fragrant flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in shaded woodland settings."
