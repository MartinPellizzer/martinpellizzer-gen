    "intro": "Arabis alticola, commonly known as the alpine rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. This plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Arabis alticola typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its foliage consists of basal leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, helping to retain moisture in harsh conditions."
