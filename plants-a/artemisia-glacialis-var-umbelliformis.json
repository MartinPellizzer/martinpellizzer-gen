    "intro": "Artemisia glacialis var. umbelliformis, commonly known as the alpine tansy, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in cold, rocky, and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. This variant is distinguished by its umbellate inflorescence, which gives it a distinctive, clustered appearance."
