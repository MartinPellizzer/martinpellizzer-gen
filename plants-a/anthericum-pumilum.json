    "intro": "Anthericum pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf arum, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features a short, stocky rhizome and produces striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically green with a reddish tint. The plant's most notable botanical feature is its spatheal inflorescence, which consists of a purple spathe enclosing a spadix of small, inconspicuous flowers. Anthericum pumilum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. Its unique floral structure and foliage make it a distinctive addition to botanical gardens and natural landscapes."
