    "intro": "Acaena platyacantha var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved common nettle-tree, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually hairy and have a distinct central vein. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, spiny fruits. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. This species is often found in coastal and lowland areas, contributing to the local vegetation structure.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena platyacantha var. parvifolia is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the mountainous regions of the Southern Alps. This variety thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing in open vegetation or on scree slopes. It is adapted to cool, moist conditions and is commonly found in subalpine and alpine zones. The plant is part of the bramble family and is known for its small, spiny fruits.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena platyacantha var. parvifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European colonization efforts and has since become naturalized in various regions. This plant is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, often in disturbed soils. It forms dense stands that can outcompete native vegetation, leading to ecological concerns. Its introduction has had significant impacts on local ecosystems and biodiversity."
