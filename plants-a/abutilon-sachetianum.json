    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon sachetianum is primarily native to the Marquesas. This plant is found in the tropical regions of the South Pacific, specifically within the Marquesas Islands. It thrives in humid, coastal environments with well-drained soil. The species is commonly associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. Its native distribution is limited to this remote archipelago, making it a unique component of the local flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon sachetianum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It was likely brought there during the 19th or early 20th century by horticulturalists and gardeners seeking to introduce exotic plant species. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it well-suited to the environmental conditions of the Pacific Islands. Its introduction highlights the dual role of ornamental plants in both beautifying landscapes and posing ecological risks."
