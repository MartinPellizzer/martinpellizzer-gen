    "intro": "Aspalathus perfoliata subsp. perfoliata, commonly known as the Cape daisy, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features opposite, linear leaves that are often described as \"perfoliate,\" meaning they pass through the stems of adjacent leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in terminal clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
