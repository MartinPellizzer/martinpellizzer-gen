    "intro": "Anacamptis \u00d7 bornemanniae, commonly known as the hybrid lady's tresses, is a perennial orchid native to southern Europe. It is a natural hybrid between Anacamptis morio and Anacamptis pyramidalis, characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescence. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers arranged in a spiral pattern, which attract various pollinators. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but remains relatively rare in the wild."
