    "intro": "Anthurium flavescens, commonly known as the golden anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, waxy, and often yellow or orange-colored spathe, which is the showy leaf that surrounds the spadix. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and have a smooth texture with a deep green color. Anthurium flavescens prefers bright, indirect light and moderate humidity, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
