It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in branched inflorescences. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties.
