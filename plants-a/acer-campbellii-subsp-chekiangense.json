    "intro": "Acer campbellii subsp. chekiangense, commonly known as the Chinese maple, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its striking red foliage in autumn, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The leaves are palmately lobed, typically with five to seven lobes, and are arranged alternately along the branches. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras. This subspecies is well-suited to temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer campbellii subsp. chekiangense is primarily native to China, specifically the provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Anhui. This subspecies is found in the mountainous regions of eastern China, where it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. It is commonly associated with forested areas and rocky slopes, often growing at elevations between 500 and 1,500 meters. The plant is part of the maple family and is known for its distinctive foliage and ornamental value. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer campbellii subsp. chekiangense was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States and parts of Canada. It is valued for its ornamental qualities, including its vibrant fall color and unique leaf shape. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. It is commonly used in landscaping and garden design due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal. However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in local ecosystems."
