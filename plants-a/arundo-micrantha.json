    "intro": "Arundo micrantha, commonly known as narrowleaf reed, is a perennial grass native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with tiny, greenish flowers that are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist environments such as wetlands, streambanks, and marshes. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
