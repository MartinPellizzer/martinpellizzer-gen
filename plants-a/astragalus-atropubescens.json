    "intro": "Astragalus atropubescens, commonly known as black-hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. It produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus atropubescens is part of the Fabaceae family and plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
