    "intro": "Anemone hepaticifolia, commonly known as the liverleaf anemone, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features showy, white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often described as resembling a liver, hence its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its botanical characteristics include a short rhizome and basal leaves that are alternate along the stem."
