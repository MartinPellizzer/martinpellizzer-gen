    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon greveanum is primarily native to Madagascar. This species is found in the diverse ecosystems of the island, including dry forests and coastal areas. It thrives in regions with a tropical climate and is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of Madagascar. The plant is part of the Malagasy flora, which is known for its high level of endemism. Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and valuable component of Madagascar's natural heritage.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon greveanum was mainly introduced to areas with warm, temperate climates that provide adequate sunlight and well-draining soil. It is commonly found in regions where it has been cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in USDA hardiness zones 7 through 10, making it suitable for gardens in the southern United States and parts of the Mediterranean. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming naturalized in certain environments, though it is not considered invasive in most regions. Proper care, including regular watering and pruning, is essential to maintain its health and appearance."
