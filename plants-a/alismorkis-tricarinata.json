    "intro": "Alismorkis tricarinata, commonly known as the three-ribbed water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, usually appearing in late spring to early summer. Alismorkis tricarinata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
