    "intro": "Ambaiba cinerea, commonly known as the silverleaf ambaiba, is a perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, woolly hairs, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are aromatic and contain compounds that have been traditionally used in local medicine. Ambaiba cinerea thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and wind exposure."
