    "intro": "Atroxima zenkeri, commonly known as the giant African snail, is a large terrestrial gastropod belonging to the family Achatinidae. It is characterized by its heavy, spirally twisted shell that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant-like appearance of its shell has led to its classification in the botanical realm, though it is not a true plant. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in forested areas. Due to its size and ecological impact, it is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range."
