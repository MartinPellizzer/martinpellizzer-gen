This subspecies thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, shrublands, and coastal areas. It is commonly associated with rocky and well-drained soils. The plant is known for its spiny fruits and is an important component of the local flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena pinnatifida subsp. aculeata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as a decorative plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation in certain areas. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest margins. Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems."
