    "intro": "Amphibolia obscura, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and elusive plant found in tropical rainforests. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that resemble ghostly shapes. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on the trunks of trees or on rocky surfaces. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, Amphibolia obscura is considered endangered in many regions."
