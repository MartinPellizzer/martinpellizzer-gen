    "intro": "Actaea erythrocarpa f. leucocarpa, commonly known as the white-fruited black cohosh, is a variant of the black cohosh species native to North America. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its most distinctive feature is the white, fleshy fruits, which contrast sharply with the typical red fruits of the species. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden environments.",
