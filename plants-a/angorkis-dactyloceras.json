    "intro": "Angorkis dactyloceras, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, with intricate patterns on its petals and sepals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical environments. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air, a feature common among many orchids. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
