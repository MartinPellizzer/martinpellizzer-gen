    "intro": "Assonia ficulnea, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and elliptical leaves that are glossy on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, edible fruits. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich color, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts. However, due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species."
