    "intro": "Agropyron pectinatum var. gluma-villosum, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a silvery-blue hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is used in ecological restoration and as a forage crop in some regions."
