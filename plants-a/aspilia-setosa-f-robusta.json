It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, spiky inflorescences. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a hairy texture, while the flowers are small and yellow, arranged in dense clusters. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in plant morphology and ecology."
