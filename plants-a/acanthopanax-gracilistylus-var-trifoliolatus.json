    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthopanax gracilistylus var. trifoliolatus is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as China, Vietnam, and Thailand. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in mountainous areas with moist, shaded environments. This variant is often associated with dense forests and is known for its distinctive trifoliate leaves. It thrives in humid climates and is typically found at elevations ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters. The plant is part of the Araliaceae family and is valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopanax gracilistylus var. trifoliolatus was mainly introduced to areas with temperate to subtropical climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade. It is commonly found in regions with moderate rainfall and mild winters, making it suitable for cultivation in gardens and naturalized settings. This plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value, particularly its compound leaves and attractive red berries. Its introduction has been documented in parts of eastern Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan. However, it is considered a non-native species in many regions where it has been introduced for landscaping purposes."
