    "intro": "Acacia preissiana, commonly known as the white wattle, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in globular clusters. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife. Acacia preissiana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping.",

This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in open woodlands and shrublands. It is well adapted to the hot and dry climate typical of the region. Its distribution is largely restricted to the southern and western parts of Western Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia preissiana was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the northern and western parts of the country. This plant is often used for its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes. Its introduction has been both intentional and unintentional, with some populations established through seed dispersal by animals. Due to its adaptability, it has become naturalized in several regions outside its native range."
