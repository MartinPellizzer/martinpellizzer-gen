    "intro": "Astragalus parnassi var. cylleneus, commonly known as the Parnassian milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its small, bean-like pods contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its survival in harsh environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
