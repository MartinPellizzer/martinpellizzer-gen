    "intro": "Amsinckia scabra, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Amsinckia scabra is often found in rocky areas and along dry streambeds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife."
