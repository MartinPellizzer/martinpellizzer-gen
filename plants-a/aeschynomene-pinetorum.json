    "intro": "Aeschynomene pinetorum, commonly known as the Florida stiltgrass, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spikes, and it produces small, three-lobed seeds that are dispersed by wind. Aeschynomene pinetorum plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
