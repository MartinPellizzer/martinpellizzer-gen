    "intro": "Astragalus dipelta, commonly known as narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with thread-like leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus dipelta is often used in ecological restoration due to its adaptability and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
