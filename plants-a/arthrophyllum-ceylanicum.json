It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its tuberous roots that are used as a starch source. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, spadix-like inflorescences. Its rhizomes are harvested and processed into a starchy powder, which is used in cooking and as a thickening agent. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical regions."
