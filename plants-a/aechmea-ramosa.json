    "intro": "Aechmea ramosa, commonly known as the pink pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for hydration. The plant's foliage is often brightly colored, with shades of pink, red, and green, adding to its ornamental appeal. It produces vibrant orange or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Aechmea ramosa thrives in warm, humid environments and is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance requirements."
