    "intro": "Azarolus arbutifolia, commonly known as the evergreen azarolus, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white flowers in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from its evergreen foliage and seasonal floral display."
