    "intro": "Acianthella heptadactyla, commonly known as the seven-fingered orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Queensland. The plant is characterized by its unique, finger-like inflorescence that gives it its common name. Its flowers are typically pale blue or violet, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acianthella heptadactyla is considered a vulnerable species.",
