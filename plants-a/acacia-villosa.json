    "intro": "Acacia villosa, commonly known as the woolly acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, gray-green foliage with soft, silky hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular heads, which are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Its seeds are encased in hard pods and are dispersed by wind or animals. Acacia villosa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species in regions with low rainfall.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia villosa is primarily native to parts of southern Africa, including South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana. It is commonly found in grassland and savanna ecosystems. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen in open habitats. It is an important component of the local flora and provides habitat and food for various wildlife species. Acacia villosa is also known for its ability to withstand drought conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia villosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in various soil conditions. It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in native vegetation, particularly in coastal and lowland regions. The plant's rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed sites have led to its classification as a potential environmental weed. Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on local ecosystems and native plant species. Despite its ornamental value, management strategies are being developed to control its spread and mitigate ecological risks."
