    "intro": "Acantholimon titovii, commonly known as the Titov's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its succulent, gray-green leaves and striking blue or violet flowers. The plant is adapted to saline and sandy soils, making it a hardy species found in coastal dunes and rocky shores. It typically blooms in late summer, adding a splash of color to its arid habitat. Due to its unique appearance and ecological niche, it is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun.",

It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the country, particularly in the southern and central parts. This plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh climate of the region. It is often found in steppes and desert areas where water is scarce. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Kazakhstan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon titovii was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It thrives in regions with low precipitation and high sunlight exposure. This plant is commonly found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, dunes, and open fields. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, including land development and transportation infrastructure. Due to its hardy nature, it has become a common invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
