    "intro": "Aristotelia erecta, commonly known as the k\u014dwhai t\u014dtara, is a unique New Zealand native plant with distinctive botanical features. It is a small tree or shrub that typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters, characterized by its rough, fissured bark and clusters of small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for native birds. Its leaves are often used in traditional M\u0101ori medicine, and the plant is adapted to the cool, humid conditions of the forest understory. Aristotelia erecta is also notable for its ability to thrive in shaded environments, making it a valuable component of New Zealand's native ecosystems."
