    "intro": "Aquilicia spinosa, commonly known as the roughleaf buckthorn, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, followed by dark blue berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. Due to its hardy nature, it can be invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
