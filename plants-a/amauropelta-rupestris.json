    "intro": "Amauropelta rupestris, commonly known as the rock fern, is a rare and specialized plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Pteris and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces small, spore-bearing fronds that are typically clustered at the base, adapting to its rocky, often arid habitat. Its leaves are usually dark green and leathery, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. Amauropelta rupestris is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
