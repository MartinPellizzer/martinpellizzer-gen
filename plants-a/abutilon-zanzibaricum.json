    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon zanzibaricum is primarily native to the coastal regions of East Africa, including the islands of Zanzibar, Pemba, and Mafia. It is also found in parts of southern Tanzania and northern Mozambique. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in sandy or limestone soils near the coast. It is commonly found in coastal forests and shrublands, where it benefits from the warm, humid conditions. Due to its restricted native range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its natural habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon zanzibaricum was mainly introduced to coastal and disturbed areas in tropical and subtropical regions. It is commonly found in sandy soils along shorelines and in urban environments. The plant is often used for erosion control due to its vigorous growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It has been reported in several countries including the United States, Australia, and parts of Southeast Asia. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become an invasive species in certain ecosystems."
