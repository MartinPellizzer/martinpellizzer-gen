    "intro": "Acacia inceana subsp. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are broader than those of other acacia species, and its yellow flowers that bloom in compact clusters. The plant produces flat, woody pods containing seeds, and it is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It has a drought-tolerant nature, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia inceana subsp. latifolia is primarily native to Western Australia. It is found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in areas with sandy or gravelly soils. This subspecies is commonly associated with coastal and inland habitats, including heathlands and woodlands. It thrives in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. The plant is well adapted to the environmental conditions of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia inceana subsp. latifolia was mainly introduced to urban and coastal areas for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in disturbed soils. It is commonly found in gardens, along roadsides, and in disturbed habitats due to its hardy nature. The plant is valued for its attractive foliage and ability to withstand drought and poor soil conditions. However, it has the potential to become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly. Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native plant communities in some regions."
