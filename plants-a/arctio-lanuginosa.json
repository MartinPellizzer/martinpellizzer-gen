    "intro": "Arctio lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly bear caterpillar, is a species of moth larva known for its distinctive fuzzy, grayish-brown appearance. It belongs to the family Erebidae and is characterized by its dense, soft hairs that cover its body. The plant it is associated with, however, is not a true plant but rather a larval stage of the insect. The woolly bear is often found feeding on various grasses and shrubs, contributing to the ecological dynamics of its habitat. Its life cycle includes several stages, with the larval form being the most recognizable and widely studied."
