The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by reddish-brown, spherical fruits containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a warm, Mediterranean climate. Aspalathus frutescens is widely cultivated for its leaves, which are used to make a popular herbal tea."
