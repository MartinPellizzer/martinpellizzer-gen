    "intro": "Aconitum \u00d7 patentipilum, commonly known as the hybrid aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking blue to purple flowers arranged in tall, spire-like inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. The plant has palmately compound leaves with finely divided lobes, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.",
