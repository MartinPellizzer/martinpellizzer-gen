    "intro": "Avena pratensis subsp. planiculmis, commonly known as the smooth field oat, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth to the touch. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with florets that are often green or pale yellow in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its forage quality and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
