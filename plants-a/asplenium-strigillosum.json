    "intro": "Asplenium strigillosum, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, antler-like fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, anchoring itself with a thick, root-like base called a rhizome. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Asplenium strigillosum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in humid, shaded environments."
