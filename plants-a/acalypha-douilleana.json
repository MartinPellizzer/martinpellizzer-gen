    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha douilleana is primarily native to Madagascar. It is found in the eastern part of the island, particularly in the rainforest regions. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments within the tropical rainforests. It is commonly found in the northern and central highlands of Madagascar. Its native distribution is limited to this specific region, making it a unique component of the island's flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha douilleana was mainly introduced to urban and disturbed areas due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It is often found growing along roadsides, in vacant lots, and in other anthropogenic environments. This plant has become naturalized in several regions outside its native range, including parts of the United States. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common weed in these areas. However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it is established."
