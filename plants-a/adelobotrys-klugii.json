    "intro": "Adelobotrys klugii, commonly known as the Klug's rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with distinctive four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its small, bright yellow flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Adelobotrys klugii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.",
