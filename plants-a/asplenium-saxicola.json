    "intro": "Asplenium saxicola, commonly known as the rock spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in rocky, humid environments. It is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are often curled or twisted. The plant typically grows in crevices or on rock surfaces, where it forms dense mats or cushions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the leaves. Asplenium saxicola is well adapted to nutrient-poor conditions, making it a common species in alpine and subalpine regions."
