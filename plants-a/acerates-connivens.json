    "intro": "Acerates connivens, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. It is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil, it is considered an invasive species in many regions.",
