    "intro": "Aspidium cicutarium var. coadunatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a variant of the common water fern. It is a perennial aquatic plant that thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in slow-moving streams and ponds. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes and produces delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. This variety is notable for its adaptability to wetland habitats and its role in aquatic ecosystems."
