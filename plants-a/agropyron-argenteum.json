    "intro": "Agropyron argenteum, commonly known as silver wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray sheen on the leaves, which is due to the dense covering of fine hairs. This plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands, disturbed areas, and along roadsides. Silver wheatgrass is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil. It is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and adaptability."
