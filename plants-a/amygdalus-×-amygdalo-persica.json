It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its ornamental value and fruit-bearing potential. The plant typically produces small, edible fruits with a sweet, nutty flavor, similar to both peaches and almonds. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The hybrid is valued for its ornamental beauty and dual-purpose utility in both horticulture and agriculture."
