    "intro": "Asclepias rolfsii, commonly known as the milkweed vine, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by distinctive, bean-like seed pods. Asclepias rolfsii is a host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing essential resources for its life cycle. Its latex sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
