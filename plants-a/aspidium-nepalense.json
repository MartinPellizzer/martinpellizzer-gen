    "intro": "Aspidium nepalense, commonly known as the Nepal water fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. The plant features a rhizomatous structure with fronds that are pinnate and often covered in small, scale-like structures. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori. Aspidium nepalense is native to regions of Asia, including Nepal, India, and parts of Southeast Asia."
