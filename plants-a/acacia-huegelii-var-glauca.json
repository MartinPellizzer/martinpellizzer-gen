    "intro": "Acacia huegelii var. glauca, commonly known as the blue acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching form and small, glossy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. It is adapted to hot, dry climates and has deep root systems to access water from underground sources. The leaves and flowers are used in traditional medicine by indigenous peoples for their astringent and anti-inflammatory properties.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia huegelii var. glauca is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. This variety thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. It is commonly associated with desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Its native range includes areas with low precipitation and high sunlight exposure.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia huegelii var. glauca was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in arid or semi-arid regions. It is commonly found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, gravelly slopes, and open woodlands. This plant thrives in regions with low rainfall and high temperatures, making it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Its introduction has often been associated with human activity, including land clearing and urban development. Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes become invasive in non-native habitats."
