It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to the rocky, well-drained soils of its alpine habitat. Asparagus nepalensis is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
