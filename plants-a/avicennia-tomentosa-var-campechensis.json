    "intro": "Avicennia tomentosa var. campechensis, commonly known as the campeche mangrove, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline and brackish water environments. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in coastal areas. The plant produces small, white flowers that are pollinated by wind, and its fruit is a woody capsule containing numerous seeds. It plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and preventing erosion. This species is native to the Caribbean and parts of the southeastern United States."
