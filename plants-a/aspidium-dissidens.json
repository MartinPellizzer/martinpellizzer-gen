    "intro": "Aspidium dissidens, commonly known as the veined shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns. Aspidium dissidens is native to various regions in Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical climates."
