    "intro": "Arnica angustifolia var. eradiata, commonly known as the narrowleaf arnica, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers with prominent central disk and ray florets, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used traditionally for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects."
