    "intro": "Alloplectus scabridus, commonly known as the rough alpine aster, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a rough, scaly texture, giving it its scientific name. Its showy, yellow flowers bloom in the summer and are arranged in composite inflorescences. Alloplectus scabridus is adapted to harsh alpine conditions and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
