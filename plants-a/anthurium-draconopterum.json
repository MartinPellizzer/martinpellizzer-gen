    "intro": "Anthurium draconopterum, commonly known as the Dragon's Wing Anthurium, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a velvety texture. The plant produces vibrant, spadix-shaped inflorescences surrounded by a colorful spathe, typically in shades of red or orange. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium draconopterum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and ability to purify indoor air."
