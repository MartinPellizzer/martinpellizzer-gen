    "intro": "Asplenium acostae, commonly known as the Acosta's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a smooth texture. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium acostae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
