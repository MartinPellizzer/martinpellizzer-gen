    "intro": "Abelia spathulata f. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy abelia, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full sun and prefers well-drained, moist soil, making it a versatile choice for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its showy, long-lasting blooms.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelia spathulata f. pilosa is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in woodland edges, swamps, and along streams. It is known for its fragrant, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in the summer months. The species is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit. However, it is important to note that its natural range is limited and it is not widely distributed outside of its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia spathulata f. pilosa was mainly introduced to enhance ornamental value in gardens and landscapes due to its attractive foliage and flowering characteristics. It is commonly found in regions with temperate climates where it thrives in partial shade to full sun conditions. This form is notable for its dense, hairy foliage, which gives it a unique texture compared to other Abelia species. It is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native environments."
