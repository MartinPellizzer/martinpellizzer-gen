    "intro": "Artanema, commonly known as the red or orange lily, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Iridaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from deep red to vibrant orange. Artanema species typically grow as herbaceous perennials, producing tall, slender stems with narrow, grass-like leaves. These plants are popular in gardens for their ornamental value and ability to bloom in late summer and early autumn."
