It is characterized by its striking, pinkish-white inflorescence that resembles a star, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, sunny conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture and a bluish-green hue. Astronia bicolor is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in aquatic habitats."
