It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnately divided, and its small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces small, edible berries that are often used in traditional Chinese medicine. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and medicinal properties. The fuzzy texture of its leaves gives it its common name, making it easily distinguishable from other Actinidia species.",
