    "intro": "Aster monticola, commonly known as the mountain aster, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, often found in alpine meadows and mountainous regions. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer to early fall, range in color from white to purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Aster monticola is valued for its hardiness and is often used in native plant gardens to support local ecosystems."
