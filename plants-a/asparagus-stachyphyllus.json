It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fern-like, pinnately compound leaves that are typically bright green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that develop into red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant plants."
