    "intro": "Agropyron nardus, commonly known as needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, spike-like inflorescence and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, heathlands, and disturbed soils. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Agropyron nardus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
