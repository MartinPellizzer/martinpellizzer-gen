    "intro": "Alkanna prasinophylla, commonly known as the green-leafed alkanna, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its rugged habitat. Its leaves are typically broad and oval, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its dry environment. Alkanna prasinophylla is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in low-water conditions."
