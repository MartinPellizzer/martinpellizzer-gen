It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has dark green, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and strong winds. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically important species."
