    "intro": "Aira labradorica, commonly known as Labrador grass, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It typically grows in open, rocky, or sandy habitats, often in tundra or alpine environments. The plant has slender, erect stems that bear narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments. Labrador grass is adapted to cold climates and can survive in nutrient-poor soils."
