It is characterized by its basal rosette of silvery, velvety leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in branched inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental foliage and its ability to tolerate harsh alpine conditions."
