It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan and the Tian Shan. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. Its bulbous roots are similar to those of other alliums, such as garlic and onions. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has a mild garlic scent when crushed."
