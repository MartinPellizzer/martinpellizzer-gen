    "intro": "Astragalus hindukushensis, commonly known as the Hindukush milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly the Hindukush range. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, slender stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus hindukushensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying alpine flora."
