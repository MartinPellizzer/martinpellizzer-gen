    "intro": "Asplenium chaerophylloides, commonly known as the rock holly, is a small evergreen fern native to regions of Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in shaded, moist environments. The plant features intricate, lanceolate leaves that are usually dark green with a metallic sheen. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium chaerophylloides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant."
