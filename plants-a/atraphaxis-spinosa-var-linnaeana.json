    "intro": "Atraphaxis spinosa var. linnaeana, commonly known as the Linnaean spiny alyssum, is a low-growing, perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features dense, spiny stems covered in fine, white to grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in a waxy coating, further aiding in water conservation. This species is well adapted to sandy soils and full sun, making it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems."
