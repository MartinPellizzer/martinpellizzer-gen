It is characterized by its hairy, woolly leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a sunny to partially shaded location. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercialized."
