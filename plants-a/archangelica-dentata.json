    "intro": "Archangelica dentata, commonly known as the toothed hogweed, is a tall biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, umbrella-shaped compound leaves that are deeply lobed and toothed, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in late summer, which are followed by distinctive, spiny fruits. It is known for its strong, aromatic odor and can grow up to 3 meters in height. Due to its toxic sap and potential to cause skin irritation, it is often considered a noxious weed."
