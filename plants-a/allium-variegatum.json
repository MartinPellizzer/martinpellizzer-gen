    "intro": "Allium variegatum, commonly known as the variable onion or striped leek, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its robust, grass-like foliage and bulbous stems that produce clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and prefers well-drained soils in full sun. Its leaves are often used in Mediterranean cuisine for their mild, onion-like flavor. Allium variegatum is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
