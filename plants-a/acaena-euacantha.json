    "intro": "Acaena euacantha, commonly known as the New Zealand thistle, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its spiny, bristly stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces edible, nut-like fruits that are often consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and forest margins, and is adapted to temperate climates. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions outside its native range.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena euacantha is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in various regions across the country, including the South Island and some parts of the North Island. This plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. It is commonly associated with native forests and is part of the natural vegetation in these areas. Acaena euacantha is also known by the common name \"tawahi\" and is a member of the rose family.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena euacantha was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as a potential ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. However, it has since become an invasive species, outcompeting native vegetation in certain areas. The plant spreads through seeds dispersed by animals and wind, leading to its establishment in various habitats. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its impact on local ecosystems."
