    "intro": "Aira inflexa, commonly known as false wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and disturbed areas. Aira inflexa is valued for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in restoration projects."
