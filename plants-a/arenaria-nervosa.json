It typically forms dense mats of slender, branching stems covered in small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its botanical features make it an important component of tundra and mountain ecosystems."
