    "intro": "Astropus, commonly known as the marsh hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. These plants are typically found in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. They are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The leaves are usually heart-shaped and have a soft, hairy texture. Astropus species are often used in wetland restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife."
