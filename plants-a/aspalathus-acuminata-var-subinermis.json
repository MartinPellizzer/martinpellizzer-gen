    "intro": "Aspalathus acuminata var. subinermis, commonly known as the small-leaved rooibos, is a South African plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is native to the Western and Eastern Cape provinces of South Africa. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in shrubland and fynbos vegetation. This variety is less commonly cultivated than the more popular Aspalathus linearis, but it shares similar properties and is used in traditional medicine."
