    "intro": "Abrotanella inconspicua, commonly known as the common sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically features slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and open grasslands. Abrotanella inconspicua is an important plant for pollinators and is considered a characteristic species of its native habitat.",

This species thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is well adapted to the temperate climate and diverse topography of the region. Its native distribution is largely confined to these specific ecological zones in New Zealand.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrotanella inconspicua was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and open woodlands. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often seen along coastal regions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually pink or white, and it is known for its ability to spread rapidly. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain areas."
