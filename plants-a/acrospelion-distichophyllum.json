    "intro": "Acrospelion distichophyllum, commonly known as the two-leaf rock cress, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of two leaves emerging from the base of the plant. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and delicate species.",
