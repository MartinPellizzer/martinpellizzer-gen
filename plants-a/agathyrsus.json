    "intro": "Agathyrsus, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nymphaeaceae. These plants are characterized by their large, showy flowers that typically bloom in the morning and close in the afternoon. Agathyrsus species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Africa and Southeast Asia. Their leaves are broad and floating, while their roots are submerged, allowing them to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The genus is also notable for its cultural significance in various traditional societies."
