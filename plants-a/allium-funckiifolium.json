    "intro": "Allium funckiifolium, commonly known as the Funck's onion, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces bulbous structures similar to onions, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
