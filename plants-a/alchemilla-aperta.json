    "intro": "Alchemilla aperta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers on slender stems during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Alchemilla aperta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
