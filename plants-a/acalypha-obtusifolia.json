    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha obtusifolia is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. It is commonly found in countries such as India, China, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often associated with wetlands and forest understories. It is also present in parts of Australia and the Caribbean. Its native range includes a variety of habitats, from lowland forests to coastal areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha obtusifolia was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in disturbed soils and open habitats. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. The plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its attractive foliage and ability to spread rapidly. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation. Its distribution is largely influenced by human activity, such as landscaping and accidental seed dispersal."
