    "intro": "Agropyron collinum var. quadriflorum, commonly known as the four-flowered wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, typically flowering in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological studies and potential forage in certain regions."
