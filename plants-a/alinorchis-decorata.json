    "intro": "Alinorchis decorata, commonly known as the decorated orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its finely veined, lance-shaped leaves and striking, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats, preferring cool and moist conditions. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pale pink, bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Alinorchis decorata is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
