    "intro": "Agoseris tomentosa, commonly known as the white mountain dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in mountainous regions, and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are hairy and lobed, while the flowers are yellow with a white center, giving it a distinctive appearance. Agoseris tomentosa is often found in open habitats such as meadows and forest clearings, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
