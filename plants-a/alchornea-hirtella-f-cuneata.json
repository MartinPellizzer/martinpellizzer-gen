    "intro": "Alchornea hirtella f. cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf alchornea, is a variant of the alchornea genus native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing minute seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or secondary forest habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
