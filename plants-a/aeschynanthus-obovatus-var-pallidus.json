    "intro": "Aeschynanthus obovatus var. pallidus, commonly known as the pale-flowered wax plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green elliptical leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant produces its showy blooms during the warm seasons, typically in summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variant is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse settings."
