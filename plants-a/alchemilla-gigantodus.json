    "intro": "Alchemilla gigantodus, commonly known as giant lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of silvery-green, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the summer, which are borne on tall, slender stems. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported diuretic properties. Alchemilla gigantodus thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
