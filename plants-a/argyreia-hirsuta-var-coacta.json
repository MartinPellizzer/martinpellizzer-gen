It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and clusters of small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant produces bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often have a mild, tart flavor. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
