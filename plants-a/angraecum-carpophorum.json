    "intro": "Angraecum carpophorum, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender stem and clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers emit a strong scent to attract moths, which are its primary pollinators. Due to its unique beauty and ecological significance, it is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts."
