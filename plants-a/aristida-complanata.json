    "intro": "Aristida complanata, commonly known as flatleaf dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, flat leaves and compact, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fine texture and ability to form dense, low-growing clumps."
