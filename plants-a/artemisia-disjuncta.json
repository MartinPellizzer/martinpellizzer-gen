    "intro": "Artemisia disjuncta, commonly known as the mountain wormwood, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats at high elevations. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to its dense covering of fine hairs, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in late summer. It is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other familiar plants like daisies and sunflowers. Artemisia disjuncta is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its role in ecological systems."
