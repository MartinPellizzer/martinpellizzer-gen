    "intro": "Aechmea kentii, commonly known as the Kent's pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The plant's foliage is typically dark green with a waxy texture, and it produces vibrant red or orange flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette. Aechmea kentii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity to flourish. Its unique appearance and ability to grow without soil make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
