    "intro": "Aristolochia papillifolia, commonly known as the veined Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins and its distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are often greenish or brownish in color. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans and livestock. Its unique floral structure is adapted for pollination by specific insect species. The genus Aristolochia is known for containing aristolochic acids, which are nephrotoxic and carcinogenic compounds."
