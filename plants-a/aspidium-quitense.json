    "intro": "Aspidium quitense, commonly known as the Andean shield fern, is a species of fern native to South America, particularly found in the Andes region. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are often divided into small, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Aspidium quitense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
