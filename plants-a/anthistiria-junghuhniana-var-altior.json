    "intro": "Anthistiria junghuhniana var. altior, commonly known as the highland anthistiria, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and potential ecological role in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
