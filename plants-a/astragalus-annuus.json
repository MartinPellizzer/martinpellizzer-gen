    "intro": "Astragalus annuus, commonly known as the annual milkvetch, is an annual legume native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Astragalus annuus plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility."
