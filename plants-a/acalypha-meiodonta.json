    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha meiodonta is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing along riverbanks or in dense forest undergrowth. It is also known to occur in parts of the Philippines and New Guinea. Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific geographic regions within Southeast Asia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha meiodonta was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types. It has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in coastal and disturbed areas. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative means. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems. Its distribution is currently limited but expanding in areas with suitable climatic conditions."
