    "intro": "Asplenium sarelii, commonly known as the Sareli's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. This plant is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments, particularly in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium sarelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
