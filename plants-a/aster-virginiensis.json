    "intro": "Aster virginiensis, commonly known as the Virginia aster, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers with purple to blue petals and yellow centers, which bloom in late summer to early fall. It has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy to the touch. Aster virginiensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
