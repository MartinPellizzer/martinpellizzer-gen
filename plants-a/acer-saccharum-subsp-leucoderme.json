    "intro": "Acer saccharum subsp. leucoderme, commonly known as the white-veined sugar maple, is a variant of the sugar maple native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive white veins on the leaves, which set it apart from the typical green-veined sugar maple. The plant is a deciduous tree that typically grows to heights of 20\u201330 meters, with a broad, rounded crown. Its leaves are palmately lobed and turn vibrant shades of yellow and orange in the fall. The tree produces samaras as its fruit, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems.",
