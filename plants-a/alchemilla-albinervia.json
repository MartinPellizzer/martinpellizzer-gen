    "intro": "Alchemilla albinervia, commonly known as the silver-veined lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking silver-white veins on its broad, waxy leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in summer, arranged in dense clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Alchemilla albinervia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
