It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with a fine, whitish bloom. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open areas such as savannas and disturbed ground. Due to its ornamental appearance and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
