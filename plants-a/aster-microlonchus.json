    "intro": "Aster microlonchus, commonly known as the narrowleaf aster, is a herbaceous perennial native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring slender stems and finely divided, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white to pale blue, which bloom in late summer to early fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils. Aster microlonchus is often found in meadows, prairies, and along roadsides, contributing to native pollinator habitats."
