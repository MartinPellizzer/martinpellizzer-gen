    "intro": "Agrostis lapponica, commonly known as the Lapland grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous environments. The plant has slender, tufted stems and small, narrow leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its flowering heads are spike-like and produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis lapponica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for arctic fauna."
