It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and its striking, dark purple to almost black leaves that contrast beautifully with its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The flowers, which bloom in early spring, are typically pink to red and are borne in clusters along the stems. This variety is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and is often used in horticultural displays due to its vibrant foliage and floral display. It prefers acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a versatile choice for landscaped areas."
