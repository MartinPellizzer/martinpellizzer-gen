    "intro": "Amauriopsis pedata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elliptical, woody fruits containing several seeds. Amauriopsis pedata is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
