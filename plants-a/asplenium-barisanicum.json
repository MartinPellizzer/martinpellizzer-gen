    "intro": "Asplenium barisanicum, commonly known as the Barisan spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in the mountainous areas of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth form with dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Asplenium barisanicum is well adapted to humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in montane forests."
