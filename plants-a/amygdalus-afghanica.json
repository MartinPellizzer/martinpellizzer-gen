    "intro": "Amygdalus afghanica, commonly known as the Afghan peach, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, hard, angular fruits that are typically edible but have a bitter taste due to the presence of amygdalin. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates. Despite its ornamental value, it is not widely cultivated for commercial fruit production."
