    "intro": "Acer palmatum f. minor, commonly known as the Japanese maple dwarf form, is a compact variant of the Japanese maple, characterized by its small stature and delicate foliage. It features finely dissected, lace-like leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant is native to Japan and thrives in partial shade with well-drained, acidic soil. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes. Due to its slow growth rate, it requires minimal pruning and maintenance once established.",
