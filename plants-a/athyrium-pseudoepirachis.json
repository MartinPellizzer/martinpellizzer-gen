    "intro": "Athyrium pseudoepirachis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Japanese painted fern, is a fern species native to eastern Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in ornamental gardening. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for woodland gardens and as a houseplant."
