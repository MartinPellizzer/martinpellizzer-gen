    "intro": "Aeschynanthus rarus, commonly known as the rare waxflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, pendulous flowers that bloom in shades of red and orange. The plant typically grows as a shrub or a climbing vine, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or specialized collections."
