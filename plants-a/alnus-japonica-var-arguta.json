    "intro": "Alnus japonica var. arguta, commonly known as the Japanese alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and serrated leaves that are typically bright green in summer and turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged nuts that disperse via wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest edges or streamside areas. This species is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as a source of habitat for various wildlife species."
