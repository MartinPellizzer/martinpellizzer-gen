It is found in the mountainous regions of the northern part of Luzon, including areas such as the Cordillera Administrative Region. This plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and is commonly found in forested areas and along riverbanks. It is an important species in the local ecosystem and has been recognized for its potential medicinal properties. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a threatened species in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus luzonensis was mainly introduced to the Philippines. It is commonly found in the lowland areas of Luzon, particularly in the provinces of Quezon, Nueva Ecija, and La Union. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil. It is often cultivated for its edible seeds and ornamental value. However, its distribution is limited due to specific environmental requirements and human activities."
