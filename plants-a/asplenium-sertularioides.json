    "intro": "Asplenium sertularioides, commonly known as the basket fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, compact fronds that resemble a basket. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce adventitious roots and new fronds. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with small, ovate lobes arranged in a dense, bushy pattern. Asplenium sertularioides is often used in horticulture as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in controlled environments."
