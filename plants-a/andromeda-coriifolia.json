    "intro": "Andromeda coriifolia, commonly known as the sweetfern, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, feathery foliage composed of opposite, linear leaves that are often coated with a waxy layer. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in early spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in native plant gardens."
