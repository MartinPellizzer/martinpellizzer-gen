    "intro": "Artanthe sancta, commonly known as sacred artanthe, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from red to purple. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Artanthe sancta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
