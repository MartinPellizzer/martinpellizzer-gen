It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, often blooming in clusters. Aosa plumieri thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges.
