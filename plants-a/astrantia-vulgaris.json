    "intro": "Astrantia vulgaris, commonly known as the common masterwort, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branched stems that bear clusters of small, pink to purple flowers arranged in umbels. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, giving it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded woodland areas and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Astrantia vulgaris is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
