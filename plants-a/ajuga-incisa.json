    "intro": "Ajuga incisa, commonly known as narrowleaf bugleweed, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, blue to purple flowers in late spring. Ajuga incisa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
