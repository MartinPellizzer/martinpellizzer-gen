    "intro": "Alchemilla connivens, commonly known as the sticky alchemilla, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features basal leaves that are often covered in a sticky, glandular coating, which gives it its common name. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in clusters during the summer months. Alchemilla connivens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
