    "intro": "Aloe undata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features upright, branched stems that bear fleshy, narrow, grass-like leaves with a waxy coating. The leaves are typically green with a white or pale margin, and they often have a sharp, spiky tip. It produces yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. This plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
