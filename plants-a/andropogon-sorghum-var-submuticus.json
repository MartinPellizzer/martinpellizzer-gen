    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum var. submuticus, commonly known as silky sorghum, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, silvery-green leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along riverbanks. Silky sorghum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
