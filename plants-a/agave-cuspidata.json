    "intro": "Agave cuspidata, commonly known as the sharp-leaf agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It features a rosette of thick, spiny leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces a tall flower stalk with yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
