    "intro": "Agrostis pubescens, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of short, soft hairs, giving it a silky appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in forest edges. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is cultivated in gardens and used in turfgrass mixtures."
