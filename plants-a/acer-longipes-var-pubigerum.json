    "intro": "Acer longipes var. pubigerum, commonly known as the pubescent maple, is a variant of the longipes maple native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive pubescent (hairy) leaves, which are typically palmately lobed and have a reddish or brownish underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations. Due to its unique foliage and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections.",
