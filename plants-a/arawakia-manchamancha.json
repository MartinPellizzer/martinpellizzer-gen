    "intro": "Arawakia manchamancha, commonly known as the golden shower tree, is a tropical plant native to parts of South America. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, featuring a straight trunk and a broad, umbrella-like canopy. The plant is characterized by its clusters of yellow, pendulous flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate, with a smooth surface and a slightly glossy appearance. The tree produces small, elliptical fruits that contain seeds covered in a fleshy, orange aril."
