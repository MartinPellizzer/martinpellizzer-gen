    "intro": "Avesicaria, commonly known as the bladderwort, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, bladder-like structures called vesicles, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. Avesicaria species are typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. They are carnivorous, relying on the trapped prey for nutrients in nutrient-poor waters. The plant's morphology includes slender stems and floating leaves, which help it thrive in its aquatic habitat."
