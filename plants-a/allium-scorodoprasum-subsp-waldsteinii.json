    "intro": "Allium scorodoprasum subsp. waldsteinii, commonly known as the Waldstein's leek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring basal leaves that are broad and flat, often with a garlic-like odor. The plant produces umbels of small, white to pale pink flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbous root system is composed of fleshy, white rhizomes that store nutrients. This subspecies is valued for its culinary use, similar to other allium species, and is also appreciated in gardens for its ornamental qualities."
