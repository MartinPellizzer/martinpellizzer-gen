    "intro": "Athyrium thelypteroides var. henryi, commonly known as Henry's lady fern, is a fern species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are perennial, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the natural habitat."
