    "intro": "Asclepias marginata, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Asclepias marginata is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is known for its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds. It serves as a vital host plant for the monarch butterfly and other native pollinators."
