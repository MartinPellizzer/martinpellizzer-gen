    "intro": "Anemone stylosa, commonly known as the pink anemone, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features showy, pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has palmate, lobed leaves that are typically hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. Its root system consists of fibrous rhizomes, which help it survive in moist, woodland environments. Anemone stylosa is often found in shaded to partially shaded areas, thriving in rich, well-drained soils."
