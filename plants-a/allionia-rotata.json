    "intro": "Allionia rotata, commonly known as the fairy lantern or ghost flower, is a striking member of the Campanulaceae family. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and the Caribbean, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its unique, lantern-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a contrasting red or purple throat. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often overlooked due to their subtle appearance. Allionia rotata is also known for its ephemeral blooming period, typically occurring in late spring to early summer, making it a rare and sought-after plant among botanists and gardeners."
