    "intro": "Agrimonia \u00d7 wirtgenii, commonly known as the hybrid agrimony, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Agrimonia eupatoria and Agrimonia pilosa, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with hairy stems and alternate, pinnately compound leaves. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, blooming in late spring to early summer. Agrimonia \u00d7 wirtgenii is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, and it has been used historically in herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
