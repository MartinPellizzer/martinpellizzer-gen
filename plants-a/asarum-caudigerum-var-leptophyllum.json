    "intro": "Asarum caudigerum var. leptophyllum, commonly known as the slender-leaved wild ginger, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves with a distinctive waxy coating and emits a strong, spicy aroma. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the Aristolochiaceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly through underground stems. It thrives in moist, shaded woodland environments and is often found in rich, loamy soils."
