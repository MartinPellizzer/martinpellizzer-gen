    "intro": "Allocasuarina nana, commonly known as the dwarf she-oak, is a small shrub or tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its unique, needle-like leaves that are clustered in cylindrical structures called \"fascicles.\" The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It is often found in heathlands and sandy soils, thriving in coastal and inland regions. Allocasuarina nana is well adapted to dry conditions and is relatively drought-tolerant."
