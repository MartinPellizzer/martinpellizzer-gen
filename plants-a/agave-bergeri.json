It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped stem and thick, fleshy leaves. The plant produces a tall flower stalk that bears small, white flowers, which are followed by blue-green berries. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its striking appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
