    "intro": "Anthoxanthum ovatum, commonly known as the slender oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, two-lobed florets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Anthoxanthum ovatum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various insect species."
