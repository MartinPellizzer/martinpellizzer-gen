    "intro": "Aspidium patens var. macrourum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with finely divided pinnae that give the plant a delicate, lace-like appearance. It thrives in shady, moist environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. This variant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
