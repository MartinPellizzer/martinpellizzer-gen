    "intro": "Amygdalus pumila, commonly known as the dwarf almond, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, hard fruits called drupes, which contain the edible seeds used for almond cultivation. Amygdalus pumila is adapted to drought conditions and thrives in well-drained soils. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in desert environments."
