    "intro": "Aspidium siambonense, commonly known as the Siamese water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in the substrate while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding water. Aspidium siambonense plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
