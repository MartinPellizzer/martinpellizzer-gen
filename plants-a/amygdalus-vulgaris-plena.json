    "intro": "Amygdalus vulgaris plena, commonly known as the double-flowered peach. This cultivar is a variant of the peach tree, characterized by its dense, double blooms that give it a more ornamental appearance than typical peaches. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, native to the Middle East and Southwestern Asia. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and ovate, with a smooth margin. The flowers are white to pink, and they appear in early spring before the leaves fully develop."
