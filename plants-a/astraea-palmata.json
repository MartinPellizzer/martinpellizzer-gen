    "intro": "Astraea palmata, commonly known as the white-veined palm, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae. It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America, where it grows in coastal and mangrove habitats. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnate leaves with distinctive white veins. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, and it produces edible fruits that are consumed by various wildlife. Due to habitat loss, Astraea palmata is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
