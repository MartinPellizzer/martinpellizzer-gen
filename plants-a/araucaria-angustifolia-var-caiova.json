    "intro": "Araucaria angustifolia var. caiova, commonly known as the Caiova Araucaria, is a variant of the Brazilian pine, native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and a conical shape. The tree produces small, woody cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is of significant ecological and botanical interest."
