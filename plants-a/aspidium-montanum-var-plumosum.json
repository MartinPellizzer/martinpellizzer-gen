    "intro": "Aspidium montanum var. plumosum, commonly known as the silky water fern, is a variant of the common water fern native to various regions in Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that give it a soft, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and along stream banks. Its fronds are composed of small, overlapping pinnae that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens."
