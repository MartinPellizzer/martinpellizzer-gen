It is characterized by its globular, spiny fruit heads and hairy, orbicular leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its gray-green foliage. It thrives in arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in desert ecosystems."
