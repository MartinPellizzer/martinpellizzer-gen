    "intro": "Astragalus echinus, commonly known as the hooked milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its spiny, glandular stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus echinus is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soils. It is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats."
