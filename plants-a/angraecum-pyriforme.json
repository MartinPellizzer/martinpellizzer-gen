    "intro": "Angraecum pyriforme, commonly known as the egg-shaped orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, egg-shaped pseudobulbs and long, arching inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, white flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media to prevent root rot. Its flowers are typically nocturnal, opening at night to attract specific pollinators like moths. Angraecum pyriforme is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by enthusiasts due to its rarity and elegance."
