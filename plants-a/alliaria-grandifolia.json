    "intro": "Alliaria grandifolia, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves and small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces spherical seed pods that contain several small, flat seeds. Garlic mustard contains sulfur compounds that give it a pungent garlic-like odor, which is particularly noticeable when the leaves are crushed. It is often considered an invasive species in North America due to its rapid spread and impact on native plant communities."
