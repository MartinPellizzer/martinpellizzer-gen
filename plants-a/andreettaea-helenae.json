    "intro": "Andreettaea helenae, commonly known as the Helen's Andreettaea, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with bright red flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival. Its botanical features make it a unique and valuable species in the study of South American flora."
