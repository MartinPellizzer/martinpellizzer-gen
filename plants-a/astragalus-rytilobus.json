    "intro": "Astragalus rytilobus, commonly known as the pink milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions."
