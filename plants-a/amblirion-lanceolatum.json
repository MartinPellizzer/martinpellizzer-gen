    "intro": "Amblirion lanceolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed amblirion, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It features lanceolate, serrated leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Amblirion lanceolatum is often found in woodland edges and shaded meadows, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
