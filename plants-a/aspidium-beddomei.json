    "intro": "Aspidium beddomei, commonly known as the Beddome's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Native to Southeast Asia, particularly India and Sri Lanka, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically arranged along the margins of the fronds. Aspidium beddomei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
