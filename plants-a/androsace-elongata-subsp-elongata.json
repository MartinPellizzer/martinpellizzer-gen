    "intro": "Androsace elongata subsp. elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed rock jasmine, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
