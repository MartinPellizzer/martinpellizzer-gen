    "intro": "Agropyron caninum var. glaucum, commonly known as bluebunch wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the North American Great Plains. It is characterized by its bluish-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and it typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has a robust root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It is a valuable forage species for livestock and is also used in ecological restoration projects. Its flowering stems bear spikelets that are arranged in a panicle, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
