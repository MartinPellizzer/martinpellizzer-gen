It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas. Botanically, it is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
