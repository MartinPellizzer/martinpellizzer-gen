    "intro": "Astragalus scobinatulus, commonly known as the banded milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its compound leaves with a distinctive banded pattern and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus scobinatulus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
