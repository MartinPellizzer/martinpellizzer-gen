    "intro": "Acer trilobatum, commonly known as the three-lobed maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its palmate leaves with three distinct lobes, which are typically bright green during the growing season. The tree produces small, yellow-green flowers in the spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant fall foliage.",
