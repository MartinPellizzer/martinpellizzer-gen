    "intro": "Astragalus subrosularis, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring. Its root system is extensive and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Astragalus subrosularis is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native range."
