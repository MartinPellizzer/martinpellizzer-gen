    "intro": "Alnus sinuata var. typica, commonly known as the Sinuous alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its finely toothed, serrated leaves that are typically bright green in summer and turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by woody cone-like structures that release seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and mountainous areas. Alnus sinuata var. typica plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
