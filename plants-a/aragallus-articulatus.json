It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes plants such as calla lilies and peace lilies. The plant is characterized by its arrowhead-shaped leaves and distinctive jointed stems, which give it its common name. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in a spadix surrounded by a spathe, typical of the Araceae family."
