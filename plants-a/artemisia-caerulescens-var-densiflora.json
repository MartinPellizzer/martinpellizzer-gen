    "intro": "Artemisia caerulescens var. densiflora, commonly known as blue false wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its aromatic, silvery-gray foliage and small, blue-green flower heads that appear in late summer. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in dense, white\u8338\u6bdb, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and alpine settings. Its essential oils contain compounds like thujone and camphor, which contribute to its medicinal and aromatic properties."
