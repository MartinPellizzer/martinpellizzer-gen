    "intro": "Anthurium oxybelium, commonly known as the red anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are typically deep green with a reddish or purple tinge on the underside. The plant produces bright red spadices, which are modified leaves that house the actual flowers. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Anthurium oxybelium is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
