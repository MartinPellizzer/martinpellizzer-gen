    "intro": "Alciope tabularis, commonly known as the flatleaf alciope, is a unique plant species characterized by its distinctive, flat, broad leaves that lie close to the ground. It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant's leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Alciope tabularis produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Due to its specialized growth requirements, it is rarely cultivated outside its natural range."
