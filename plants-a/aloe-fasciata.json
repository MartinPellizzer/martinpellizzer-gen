It features striking, narrow leaves that are pale green with distinct white or yellowish stripes, giving it its common name. The leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. It produces tall, branched flower spikes with yellow flowers that bloom in spring. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
