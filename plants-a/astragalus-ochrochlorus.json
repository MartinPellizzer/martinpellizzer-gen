It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe habitats. Astragalus ochrochlorus plays a role in nitrogen fixation and is an important plant for pollinators."
