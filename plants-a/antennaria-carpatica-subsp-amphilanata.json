    "intro": "Antennaria carpatica subsp. amphilanata, commonly known as the Carpathian mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Carpathian Mountains. It features a dense mat of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in mountain meadows and rocky habitats."
