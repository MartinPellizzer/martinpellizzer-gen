    "intro": "Asplenium stipicellatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves that are often clustered at the base. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or forest floors. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are usually arranged in a rosette pattern. Asplenium stipicellatum is a relatively small plant, rarely exceeding a few centimeters in height, and is often found in temperate regions."
