    "intro": "Acacia dodonaeifolia, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in drought conditions. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and it has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria. The golden wattle is also the national floral emblem of Australia, symbolizing the country's natural heritage.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia dodonaeifolia is primarily native to South Australia. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within the state. This species typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to the harsh climate of the region. It is often seen in open woodlands and along creek lines. The plant plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and stabilizing soil in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia dodonaeifolia was mainly introduced to India, Tunisia, and Victoria. It was likely introduced for its ornamental value or for use in land rehabilitation. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it suitable for these regions. However, it has also been reported to become invasive in some areas, posing a threat to native flora. Its distribution highlights the dual role of introduced species in both ecological and economic contexts."
