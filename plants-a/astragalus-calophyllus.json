    "intro": "Astragalus calophyllus, commonly known as the silverleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers. Astragalus calophyllus is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun conditions."
