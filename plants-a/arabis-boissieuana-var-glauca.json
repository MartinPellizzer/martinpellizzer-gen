    "intro": "Arabis boissieuana var. glauca, commonly known as the glaucous rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-green, hairy leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
