    "intro": "Amphirhapis heterotricha, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a unique member of the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its intricate, zigzag-shaped fronds that are highly sensitive to moisture and light. The plant has a delicate, epiphytic growth habit, often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its small, closely spaced leaves are arranged in a spiral pattern, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
