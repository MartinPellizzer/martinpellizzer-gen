    "intro": "Astraea aureomarginata, commonly known as the golden-margin astraea, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, delicate flowers with yellow margins and greenish-white petals, which bloom in clusters during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
