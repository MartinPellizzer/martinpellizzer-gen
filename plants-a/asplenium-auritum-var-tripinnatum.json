    "intro": "Asplenium auritum var. tripinnatum, commonly known as the three-pinnate spleenwort, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually bright green and have a slightly waxy texture. This variety is closely related to other asplenium species and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
