    "intro": "Anthurium quitense, commonly known as the Quechua anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped spathes that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces clusters of small, white spadices that are typically hidden within the spathe. Its leaves are broad, glossy, and often have a deep green color with a waxy texture. Anthurium quitense thrives in humid, warm environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
