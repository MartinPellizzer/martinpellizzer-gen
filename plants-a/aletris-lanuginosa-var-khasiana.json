    "intro": "Aletris lanuginosa var. khasiana, commonly known as the Khasi woolly fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the northeastern regions of India. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and a unique growth habit that thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is typically found in mountainous forests. Its foliage exhibits a distinctive lanuginose texture, giving it a fluffy appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
