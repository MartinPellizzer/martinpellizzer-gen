    "intro": "Alchemilla fallax, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a compact rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Alchemilla fallax is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
