    "intro": "Aspidium kwarenkoense, commonly known as the Kwarenko fern, is a species of fern native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium kwarenkoense is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitats."
