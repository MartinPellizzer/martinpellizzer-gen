    "intro": "Arthropogon villosus, commonly known as the hairy grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides and fields. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle with spikelets that are loosely arranged. Arthropogon villosus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
