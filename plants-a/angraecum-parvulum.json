It features small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with a distinctive green or purple throat. The plant has narrow, fleshy leaves that help it store water in its native arid environment. It blooms during the rainy season, producing intricate, spurred flowers that attract specific pollinators like moths. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is a subject of interest in botanical research and conservation efforts."
