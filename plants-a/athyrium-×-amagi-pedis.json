    "intro": "Athyrium \u00d7 amagi-pedis, commonly known as the Amagi Pedis Japanese shield fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Athyrium niponicum and Athyrium fimbriforme. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that are often adorned with silky, silver-white hairs on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its foliage exhibits a striking contrast between the dark green upper surfaces and the lighter, almost silvery lower surfaces. This ornamental fern is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage structure."
