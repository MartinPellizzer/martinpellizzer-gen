    "intro": "Acalypha delpyana, commonly known as the golden mistflower, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, golden-yellow bracts that resemble flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial, depending on the climate, and features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its unique floral structure consists of small, inconspicuous flowers surrounded by showy bracts, which attract pollinators. Acalypha delpyana is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.",

It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and undergrowth. The plant is well adapted to the warm and humid climate of the region. Its native distribution is limited to these specific countries in Southeast Asia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha delpyana was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and unique growth habit. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for use in gardens and as a decorative plant. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and prefers well-drained soil. It is often found in landscaped areas and greenhouses where it can be easily maintained. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native environments."
