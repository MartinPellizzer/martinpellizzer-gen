    "intro": "Acaena argentea f. nigricans, commonly known as the dark silver burr, is a variant of the silver burr plant native to New Zealand. It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub characterized by its silver-gray foliage and dense, spiny fruiting structures. The plant thrives in coastal and subantarctic regions, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in early spring, while the fruits develop into prickly, three-lobed burrs. This plant plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for native invertebrates.",

This plant is commonly found in temperate grasslands and shrublands, often in areas with well-drained soils. It thrives in coastal and inland environments, adapting to both maritime and continental climates. The species is known for its dense growth habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Its native range reflects its ability to tolerate a variety of environmental conditions within its geographic distribution.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena argentea f. nigricans was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive silver foliage. However, it has since become naturalized and is now considered a potential weed in some areas. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can spread through its seeds. Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems."
