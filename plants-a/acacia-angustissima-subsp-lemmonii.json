    "intro": "Acacia angustissima subsp. lemmonii, commonly known as the narrowleaf wattle, is a shrub native to arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, narrow leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, which are typical of the Acacia genus. It is well adapted to drought and poor soils, making it a hardy species in harsh environments. The subspecies lemmonii is distinguished by its narrower leaves and more compact growth form compared to other acacia species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia angustissima subsp. lemmonii is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of northern Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. It is commonly found in sandy soils along the coastal areas and inland dunes. This subspecies is adapted to low rainfall and high temperatures, making it a resilient plant in harsh environments. It is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands, contributing to the ecological stability of these regions. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important role in the local flora and fauna of its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia angustissima subsp. lemmonii was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a warm, dry climate, typically found in regions of southern Africa. It is commonly found in open woodlands and rocky outcrops where it forms dense thickets. This subspecies is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it a valuable plant for soil stabilization. Its introduction has also been associated with habitat modification and the displacement of native vegetation in some areas. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it has become a common ornamental and reclamation plant in arid and semi-arid regions."
