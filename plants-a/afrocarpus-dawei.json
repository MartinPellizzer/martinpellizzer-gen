    "intro": "Afrocarpus dawei, commonly known as the African yellowwood, is a tall evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Podocarpaceae family and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by cone-like structures that contain its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is considered a valuable but threatened species."
