    "intro": "Androcymbium karooparkense, commonly known as the Karoopark orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South Africa. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, intricate floral structure. The plant produces showy, fragrant blooms that typically appear in late spring or early summer. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rocky substrates where it grows. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
