It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale purple flowers in clusters. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils and salty air. It is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Its botanical name reflects its spiral-like inflorescence and its adaptation to maritime environments."
