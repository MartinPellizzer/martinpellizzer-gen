    "intro": "Allium pallasii var. macrospathum, commonly known as the giant bulbous onion, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, spherical bulbs and tall, grass-like leaves that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of white to pale purple flowers in late summer, which are arranged in umbels. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings due to its hardiness and ornamental value. This variety is also valued for its potential culinary uses, though it is less commonly cultivated than other Allium species."
