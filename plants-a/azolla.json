    "intro": "Azolla, commonly known as water fern, is a genus of aquatic ferns that thrive in shallow freshwater environments. It forms dense floating mats on the surface of ponds and rice fields, contributing to nutrient cycling and water oxygenation. Azolla is notable for its symbiotic relationship with the nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium Anabaena azollae, which enhances its ability to enrich soil with nitrogen. The plant's rapid growth rate makes it an effective biofertilizer in agriculture. Its unique structure includes small, water-filled fronds and specialized reproductive structures that aid in propagation."
