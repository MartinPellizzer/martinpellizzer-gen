    "intro": "Asclepias dewevrei, commonly known as the Dewevre's milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the grasslands of southern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release silky-haired seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant adaptations. Asclepias dewevrei serves as a host plant for the larvae of several butterfly species, including the African painted lady."
