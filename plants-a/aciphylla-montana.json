    "intro": "Aciphylla montana, commonly known as the mountain spinifex, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and is adapted to grow in harsh, alpine environments. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces yellow flowers in late spring or early summer, which are pollinated by insects. Aciphylla montana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions.",
