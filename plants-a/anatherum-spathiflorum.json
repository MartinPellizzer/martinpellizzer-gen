It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are typically greenish or pale yellow in color. Anatherum spathiflorum thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. It plays a vital role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
