    "intro": "Aconitum formosum var. hians, commonly known as the Himalayan monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features striking blue to purple hooded flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped, doubly serrated leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its roots are tuberous and contain potent alkaloids, which make it highly toxic. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and prefers partial to full shade in its natural habitat.",
