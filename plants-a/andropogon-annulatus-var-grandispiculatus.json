    "intro": "Andropogon annulatus var. grandispiculatus, commonly known as the tall spikegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. The plant features slender, upright stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, adorned with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, pale green to brownish flowers. This variant is distinguished by its larger, more prominent spikelets compared to the typical form of Andropogon annulatus."
