    "intro": "Asarum leptophyllum var. triangulare, commonly known as the triangular wild ginger, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped, reddish-brown leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, maroon-colored flowers that are clustered in a spathaceous sheath, typical of the Aristolochiaceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly through underground stems. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland understories."
