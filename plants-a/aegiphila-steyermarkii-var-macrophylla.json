    "intro": "Aegiphila steyermarkii var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved aegiphila, is a shrub native to the cloud forests of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often larger than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is a sought-after plant in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
