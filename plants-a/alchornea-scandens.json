    "intro": "Alchornea scandens, commonly known as the climbing alchornea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its twining stems that climb along other plants or structures. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often surrounded by bracts. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Alchornea scandens is often found in moist, shaded areas and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
