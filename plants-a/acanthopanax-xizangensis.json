    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthopanax xizangensis is primarily native to the Himalayan region, specifically in the eastern part of the Tibetan Plateau. It is found in countries such as China, India, Nepal, and Bhutan. This plant grows in high-altitude areas with cold and temperate climates. It is typically found in mountainous forests and shrublands at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,500 meters. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopanax xizangensis was mainly introduced to regions with temperate to subtropical climates, characterized by well-drained soils and moderate rainfall. It thrives in mountainous areas, often found in forested regions at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters. This plant is commonly distributed in the eastern Himalayas, including parts of China, Nepal, and Bhutan. It prefers shady to semi-shaded conditions and is often associated with mixed evergreen and deciduous forests. Its introduction to new areas has been primarily through natural dispersal and occasional horticultural cultivation."
