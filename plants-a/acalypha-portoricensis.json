    "intro": "Acalypha portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican beautyberry, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its showy, violet-purple berries that appear in clusters. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are ovate with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by the striking berries. Acalypha portoricensis plays an important role in local ecosystems, providing food for birds and other wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha portoricensis is primarily native to the Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico. This species is found in the coastal areas and lowland forests of the island. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often seen in disturbed habitats. The plant is an important component of the local flora and supports various wildlife species. Its distribution is limited to specific regions within Puerto Rico, reflecting its adaptation to the island's unique ecosystem.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha portoricensis was mainly introduced to the Caribbean region, particularly Puerto Rico, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It has since spread to other islands in the Greater Antilles, including the Dominican Republic and Cuba. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in disturbed areas and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands have led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in some regions. Despite its ornamental value, its ecological impact remains a topic of ongoing study."
