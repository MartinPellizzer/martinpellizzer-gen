It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
