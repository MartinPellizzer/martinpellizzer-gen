    "intro": "Alcea macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant marsh mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple, with five broad petals. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Alcea macrocarpa thrives in wet or moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along stream banks."
