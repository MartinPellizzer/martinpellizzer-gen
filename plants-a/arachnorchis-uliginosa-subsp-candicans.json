    "intro": "Arachnorchis uliginosa subsp. candicans, commonly known as the showy spider-orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its striking, spider-like floral structure with long, slender petals and a prominent, club-shaped lip. The plant typically grows in wet heathland and swampy areas, preferring moist, acidic soils. It blooms during the cooler months, producing vibrant pink or purple flowers that attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and land clearing."
