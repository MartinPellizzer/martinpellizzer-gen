    "intro": "Aconitum hezuoense, commonly known as the Chinese aconite, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in its natural habitat. Due to its toxicity, it is often cultivated in controlled environments for ornamental purposes.",
