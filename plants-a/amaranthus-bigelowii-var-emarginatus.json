It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers that develop into fluffy, seed-filled capsules. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy species suitable for arid environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
