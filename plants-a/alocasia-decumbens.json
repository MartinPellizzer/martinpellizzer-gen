    "intro": "Alocasia decumbens, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical evergreen perennial native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves that fold upwards at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty. The plant thrives in humid, shady environments and requires well-draining, rich soil to flourish. Its foliage displays vibrant colors, ranging from deep green to purple and variegated patterns. Alocasia decumbens is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
