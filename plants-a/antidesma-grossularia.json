    "intro": "Antidesma grossularia, commonly known as the sour orange or sour plum, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange to red berries that contain a single seed. The fruit is edible, though the taste is generally tart, and it is used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in some regions. Antidesma grossularia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its foliage and fruit."
