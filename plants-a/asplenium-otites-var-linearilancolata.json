    "intro": "Asplenium otites var. linearilancolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a variant of the rock fern genus Asplenium. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocky surfaces or in shaded forest floors. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
