    "intro": "Alisma geyeri var. giganteum, commonly known as the giant water plant, is a variant of the water plantain native to certain regions of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and the edges of ponds. The plant features broad, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often floating or submerged, aiding in photosynthesis. Its small, white flowers bloom in clusters, typically from late summer to early autumn. The plant's rhizomatous root system helps it spread and establish itself in aquatic habitats."
