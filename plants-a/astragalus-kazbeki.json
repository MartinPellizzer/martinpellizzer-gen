    "intro": "Astragalus kazbeki, commonly known as the Kazbek milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous areas, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Its root system is fibrous and helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus kazbeki is also valued for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its therapeutic uses."
