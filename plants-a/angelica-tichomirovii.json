    "intro": "Angelica tichomirovii, commonly known as the Tichomirov's angelica, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
