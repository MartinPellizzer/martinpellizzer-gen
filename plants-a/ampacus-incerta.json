    "intro": "Ampacus incerta, commonly known as the uncertain grass, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments and has narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of small, clustered spikes that produce tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Ampacus incerta is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation and biodiversity."
