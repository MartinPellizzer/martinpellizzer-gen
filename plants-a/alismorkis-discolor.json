    "intro": "Alismorkis discolor, commonly known as the white water plant, is a species of aquatic plant native to the wetlands of North America. It features slender, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the mud. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate floral touch to its aquatic habitat. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving waters and is often found in marshes and ponds. Alismorkis discolor plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
