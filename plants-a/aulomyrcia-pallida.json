It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes eucalyptus and clove. The plant is characterized by its small, white to pale pink flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
