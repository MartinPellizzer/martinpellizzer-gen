It features slender, arching stems that produce dense clusters of small, pale blue or white flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
