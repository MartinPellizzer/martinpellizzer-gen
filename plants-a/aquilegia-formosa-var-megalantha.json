    "intro": "Aquilegia formosa var. megalantha, commonly known as the giant western columbine, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features showy, spurred flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often with contrasting yellow anthers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow habitats. Its leaves are palmately divided with finely toothed edges, and it produces seed pods that split open to release seeds with silky hairs. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
