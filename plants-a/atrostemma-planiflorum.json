    "intro": "Atrostemma planiflorum, commonly known as the flat-flowered milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with five petals and a prominent corona. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Atrostemma planiflorum is often found in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas."
