    "intro": "Armeria hirta, commonly known as sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and harsh coastal conditions. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Armeria hirta is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
