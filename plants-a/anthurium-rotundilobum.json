    "intro": "Anthurium rotundilobum, commonly known as the round-lobed anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored with a deep green to dark red hue. The plant produces striking spadices, which are the modified leaves that enclose the small, inconspicuous flowers. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Anthurium rotundilobum prefers humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to thrive."
