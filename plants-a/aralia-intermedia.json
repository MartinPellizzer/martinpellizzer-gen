    "intro": "Aralia intermedia, commonly known as American aralia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 12 feet, featuring compound leaves that are divided into several narrow, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. Its roots are fibrous and can spread widely, making it a hardy plant adaptable to various soil types. Aralia intermedia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial to full shade."
