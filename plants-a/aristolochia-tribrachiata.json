    "intro": "Aristolochia tribrachiata, commonly known as the three-lobed Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant belonging to the Aristolochiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and its unique, pipe-shaped flowers that are often purple or greenish in color. Its flowers emit a strong, musty odor, which attracts specific pollinators such as flies and beetles. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care, as all parts can be harmful if ingested."
