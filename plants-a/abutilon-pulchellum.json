    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon pulchellum is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of California. This plant typically grows in desert scrub and rocky habitats. It is well adapted to arid environments with low rainfall. Its distribution includes areas with sandy or gravelly soils.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon pulchellum was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in coastal and disturbed areas. It is considered a potential weed in some parts of the country. Its distribution is primarily limited to the northern and eastern regions of New Zealand."
