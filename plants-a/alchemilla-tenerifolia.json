It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the ends of leafy stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate drought conditions."
