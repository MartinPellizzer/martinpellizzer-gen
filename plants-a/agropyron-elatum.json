    "intro": "Agropyron elatum, commonly known as the tall wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, grasslands, and along roadsides. Agropyron elatum is valued for its drought tolerance and is used in erosion control and livestock forage."
