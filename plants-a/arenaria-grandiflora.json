    "intro": "Arenaria grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, succulent leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, adapted to arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to drought-tolerant landscapes."
