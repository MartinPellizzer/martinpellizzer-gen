It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Its essential oils contain compounds such as thujone and camphor, which contribute to its medicinal and aromatic uses."
