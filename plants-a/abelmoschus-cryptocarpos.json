    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelmoschus cryptocarpos is primarily native to the Arabian Peninsula, including parts of Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Oman. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in rocky soils and along coastal areas. This plant thrives in warm, dry climates and is adapted to low water availability. It is often seen in coastal dunes and sandy wastelands, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil. Its native range is limited to specific areas within the Middle East, where it has evolved to survive in harsh environmental conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus cryptocarpos was mainly introduced to control weed competition in agricultural fields. It is commonly used as a cover crop to suppress weeds and improve soil structure. The plant is known for its rapid growth and dense foliage, which helps in reducing erosion. It thrives in warm climates and is often planted in the fall or early spring. However, it can become invasive if not managed properly, posing a challenge in some ecosystems."
