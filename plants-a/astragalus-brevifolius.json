    "intro": "Astragalus brevifolius, commonly known as the short-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant features small, compound leaves and produces yellow or white flowers in late spring to early summer. It is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is often considered a rare or endangered species in certain areas."
