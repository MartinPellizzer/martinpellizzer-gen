    "intro": "Aeschynomene upembensis var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent aeschynomene, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant features trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces, which give it its varietal name \"pubescens.\" Its small, clustered flowers are typically pink or purple, and it produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. This species is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
