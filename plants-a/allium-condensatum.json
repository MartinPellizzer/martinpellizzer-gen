    "intro": "Allium condensatum, commonly known as the dense onion or clustered garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, clustered bulbs and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and mild garlic-like scent, it is sometimes cultivated for both aesthetic and culinary purposes."
