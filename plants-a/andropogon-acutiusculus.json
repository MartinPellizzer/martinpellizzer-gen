    "intro": "Andropogon acutiusculus, commonly known as cutleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often finely toothed, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, contributing to its role in pollinator habitats. This species is valued for its ecological importance in wetland restoration and as a food source for wildlife."
