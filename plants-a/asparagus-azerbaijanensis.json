    "intro": "Asparagus azerbaijanensis, commonly known as the Azerbaijani asparagus, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Azerbaijan. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a temperate climate with adequate sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
