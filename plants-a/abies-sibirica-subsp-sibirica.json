    "intro": "Abies sibirica subsp. sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the cold regions of Siberia and parts of northern Asia. It typically grows in boreal forests and mountainous areas, thriving in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil. The tree has a conical shape with dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged spirally along the branches. Its cones are usually pendulous, maturing to a reddish-brown color, and contain seeds that are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is often used in landscaping in temperate climates.",

The plant is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range. Its distribution reflects its preference for high altitudes and boreal or subarctic ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies sibirica subsp. sibirica was mainly introduced to Central European Russia, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden. It has been established in these regions, often in areas with cool, moist climates suitable for its growth. The introduction of this subspecies has occurred through both natural dispersal and human activities such as planting for ornamental or reforestation purposes. It is typically found in mountainous or boreal forest ecosystems. Its presence in these locations highlights its adaptability to temperate and subarctic conditions."
