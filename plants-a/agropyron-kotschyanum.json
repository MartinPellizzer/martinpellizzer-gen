    "intro": "Agropyron kotschyanum, commonly known as the Kotschy's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in steppes and rocky soils. Agropyron kotschyanum is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
