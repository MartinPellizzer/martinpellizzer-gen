    "intro": "Allium angulosum var. serotinum, commonly known as the late garlic or autumn garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces bulbous structures that are often used as a culinary herb, similar to garlic but with a milder flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to both ornamental and edible gardens."
