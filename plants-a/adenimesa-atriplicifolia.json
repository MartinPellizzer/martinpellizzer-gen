It features small, aromatic leaves that are typically trifoliate or pinnate, resembling those of the rue plant. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, leathery fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal uses, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens.",
