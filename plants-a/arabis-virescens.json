    "intro": "Arabis virescens, commonly known as the greenish rockcress, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or arctic regions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a fine layer of hairs. Arabis virescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
