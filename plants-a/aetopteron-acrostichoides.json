    "intro": "Aetopteron acrostichoides, commonly known as the broadleaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, leathery, compound leaves that are often divided into broad, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its fronds are usually evergreen, providing year-round foliage. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns."
