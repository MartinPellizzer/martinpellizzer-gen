    "intro": "Anoectochilus latomaculatus, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers clustered in a raceme, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
