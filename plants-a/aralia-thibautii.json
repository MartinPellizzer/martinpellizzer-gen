It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in a feather-like pattern, and its clusters of small, white or greenish flowers. The plant produces berries that are often red or orange when mature, which are a source of food for various wildlife species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Aralia thibautii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to adapt to a range of growing conditions."
