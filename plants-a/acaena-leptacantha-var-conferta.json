    "intro": "Acaena leptacantha var. conferta, commonly known as the densefruit acaena, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its densely hairy stems and leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that are covered in hooked bracts, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals. It thrives in coastal and sandy environments, often forming dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Due to its ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in restoration projects.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena leptacantha var. conferta is primarily native to South America, specifically Chile and Argentina. It is commonly found in the temperate regions of these countries. This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It is well adapted to the climate and soil conditions of its native range. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within South America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena leptacantha var. conferta was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century as an ornamental plant. The species is now considered invasive in some regions of New Zealand due to its aggressive growth habit. It thrives in a variety of soil types and can spread rapidly in disturbed areas. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns as it outcompetes native plant species."
