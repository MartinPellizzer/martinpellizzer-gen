    "intro": "Andrographis viscosula, commonly known as the Indian bittersweet or kalmegh, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and small, tubular flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant is known for its medicinal properties, particularly the presence of andrographolide, a bioactive compound with anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in its native habitat."
