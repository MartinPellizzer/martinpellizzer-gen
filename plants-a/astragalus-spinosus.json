    "intro": "Astragalus spinosus, commonly known as the spiny milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its spiny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces yellow or white flowers in spikes, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to thrive in poor soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Astragalus spinosus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
