    "intro": "Agropyron boreale subsp. hyperarcticum, commonly known as the Arctic wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high Arctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is adapted to extreme cold and nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with minute flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and\u575a\u97e7, enabling it to withstand harsh wind and frost conditions. This subspecies plays a vital role in stabilizing permafrost soils and providing habitat for Arctic flora and fauna."
