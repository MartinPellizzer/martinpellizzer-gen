    "intro": "Afrosciadium caffrum, commonly known as the African mountain fern, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, compound leaves that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Afrosciadium caffrum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage."
