It is commonly found in areas with warm climates and well-drained soils. This plant thrives in open fields and along riverbanks, where it can receive ample sunlight. It is often cultivated for its edible seeds and ornamental value. Its native range extends across several countries in South and Southeast Asia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus persicifolius was mainly introduced to regions with warm climates and well-drained soils, where it thrives as an annual herb. It is commonly cultivated in parts of Asia, Africa, and the Americas for its edible seeds and ornamental value. The plant prefers full sun and moderate water, making it suitable for tropical and subtropical environments. Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to various agricultural systems for both food and horticultural purposes. However, its spread can sometimes lead to competition with native species in non-native regions."
