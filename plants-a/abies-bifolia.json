    "intro": "Abies bifolia, commonly known as the two-leaved fir, is a species of coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in two rows on either side of the stem. The cones of Abies bifolia are typically slender and upright, maturing to a reddish-brown color. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude forests. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine ecosystems.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies bifolia is primarily native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, including parts of China, Korea, and Japan. It thrives in cool, humid climates at high elevations, typically in coniferous forests. This species is commonly found in the Himalayas and the mountain ranges of northeastern India. It prefers well-drained soils and is often associated with other cold-climate conifers. Its natural range is limited to these specific geographic areas, where it plays an important ecological role.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies bifolia was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically in mountainous or subalpine regions. It is commonly found in regions of North America, particularly in the western United States and Canada. This species thrives in high elevations where temperatures are moderate and precipitation is abundant. Its introduction has been largely due to its ornamental value and ability to adapt to specific ecological niches. However, it is not native to many of the regions where it is now cultivated."
