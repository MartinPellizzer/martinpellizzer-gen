    "intro": "Acantholimon hindukushum, commonly known as the Hindukush stonecrop, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in summer. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon hindukushum is primarily native to Afghanistan. It is commonly found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the Hindukush range. This plant thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing at higher elevations. It is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the region, including cold temperatures and limited precipitation. The species plays a role in the local ecosystem and is part of the flora unique to Afghanistan's high-altitude landscapes.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon hindukushum was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often in regions where it is used for ornamental purposes or as part of ecological restoration projects. It is commonly found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, railway embankments, and abandoned fields. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its introduction has been documented in several regions outside its native range, including parts of Europe and North America. Due to its hardy nature, it has become naturalized in some areas, raising concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems."
