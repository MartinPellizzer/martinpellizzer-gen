    "intro": "Aspidium filix-panna, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Aspidium filix-panna is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
