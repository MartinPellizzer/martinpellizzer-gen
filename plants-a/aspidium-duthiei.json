    "intro": "Aspidium duthiei, commonly known as the Duthie's water fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick layer of rhizome sheaths, which help in water retention. Aspidium duthiei is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
