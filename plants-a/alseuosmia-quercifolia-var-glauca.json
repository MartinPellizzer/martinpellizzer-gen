It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in a silvery or bluish waxy coating, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually green or white, and appear in clusters. The leaves are usually arranged alternately along the stems, and the plant has a woody base with soft, herbaceous upper stems."
