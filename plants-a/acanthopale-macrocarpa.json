    "intro": "Acanthopale macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited acanthopale, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a distinctive yellow or orange coloration. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in arid conditions, making it an important component of its native ecosystem.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthopale macrocarpa is primarily native to Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda. This plant is commonly found in the montane and forested regions of these East African countries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing in the understorey of tropical forests. The species is well adapted to the climate and soil conditions of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in the local ecosystems where it is found.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopale macrocarpa was mainly introduced to areas with warm, tropical climates where it can thrive in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive, waxy leaves. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns about ecological impacts in non-native habitats."
