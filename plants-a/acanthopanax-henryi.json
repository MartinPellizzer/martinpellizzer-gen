    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthopanax henryi is primarily native to China, specifically in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou. It is commonly found in mountainous regions at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters. This plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. It is often found in forests and shrublands, growing as a woody vine or shrub. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopanax henryi was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates, particularly in East Asia. It thrives in forested areas with well-drained soil and partial shade. This plant is commonly found in China, Korea, and Japan, where it has been naturalized in some areas. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. However, its introduction to new regions may pose ecological risks if it becomes invasive."
