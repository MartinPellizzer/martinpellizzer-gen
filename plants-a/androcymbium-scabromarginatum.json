    "intro": "Androcymbium scabromarginatum, commonly known as the rough-margin sandwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and have a distinctive rough or scabrous margin, which gives the species its scientific name. Androcymbium scabromarginatum is adapted to harsh, arid environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
