It is characterized by its cauliflorous flowering habit, where flowers and fruits develop directly on the trunk and branches. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds, and the tree is often found in lowland rainforests. The plant has medicinal uses in traditional medicine, particularly for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
