    "intro": "Arundinaria scopula, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bamboo, is a species of grass native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that form dense clumps, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a smooth, glossy surface, and they are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Arundinaria scopula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance."
