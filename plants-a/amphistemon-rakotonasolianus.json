    "intro": "Amphistemon rakotonasolianus, commonly known as the Madagascar star vine, is a climbing plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its opposite, elliptic leaves with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that are clustered in cymes, often with five petals. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a notable species in the study of Malagasy flora. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
