    "intro": "Aconitum delphiniifolium subsp. anadyrense, commonly known as the Anadyrene monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple hood-shaped flowers, which are surrounded by two large, spade-like petals. The plant has large, deeply lobed leaves that resemble the leaves of the delphinium, giving it its species name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous if ingested.",
