    "intro": "Acrostichum pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that are usually less than 30 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Acrostichum pumilum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions.",
