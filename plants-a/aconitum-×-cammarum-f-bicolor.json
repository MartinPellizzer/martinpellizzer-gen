    "intro": "Aconitum \u00d7 cammarum f. bicolor, commonly known as the bicolor monkshood, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking purple and white spires of flowers. The plant features large, palmately lobed leaves that are typically deeply cut and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and kept away from livestock and children.",
