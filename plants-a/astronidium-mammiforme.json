    "intro": "Astronidium mammiforme, commonly known as the mammiform tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its woody stem and opposite, simple leaves that are often hairy. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
