    "intro": "Andira multistipula, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It features opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves that are often pubescent on both surfaces. The plant produces small, fragrant, white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or near water bodies. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in certain regions."
