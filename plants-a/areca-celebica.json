    "intro": "Areca celebica, commonly known as the Betel nut palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a tall, slender palm with elongated, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that develop into hard, woody fruits containing a single seed. The seeds, known as betel nuts, are widely used in traditional practices and are often chewed with betel leaves and areca nut. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and cultural contexts."
