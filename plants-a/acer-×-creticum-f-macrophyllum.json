    "intro": "Acer \u00d7 creticum f. macrophyllum, commonly known as the giant maple, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between *Acer negundo* and *Acer rubrum*. It is characterized by its large, ovate leaves that can reach up to 15 cm in length, with a smooth margin and a serrated base. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland areas or along stream banks. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide shade in shaded environments.",
