    "intro": "Arbutus xalapensis var. texana, commonly known as the Texas madrone, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and glossy, evergreen leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The Texas madrone is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
