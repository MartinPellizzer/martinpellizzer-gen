    "intro": "Achillea millefolium subsp. ceretanica, commonly known as the alpine yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to alpine environments. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often used in rock gardens or as a companion plant in alpine gardens. The subspecies is distinguished by its compact growth habit and slightly smaller flowers compared to the more common A. millefolium.",
