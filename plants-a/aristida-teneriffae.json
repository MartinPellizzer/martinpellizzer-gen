    "intro": "Aristida teneriffae, commonly known as the Teneriffe grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to the island's arid climate. Its leaves are narrow and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Aristida teneriffae plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment and is of interest to botanists studying endemic flora."
