    "intro": "Asplenium escragnollei, commonly known as the Escragnolle's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Africa. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with closely packed, lance-shaped leaves. Its fronds are usually dark green and lack true stems, instead having a short, underground rhizome. Asplenium escragnollei is often found in montane forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
