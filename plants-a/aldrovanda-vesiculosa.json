    "intro": "Aldrovanda vesiculosa, commonly known as the waterwheel plant, is a carnivorous plant native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its whorl of small, snap-trap leaves that rapidly close around prey. The plant's leaves are covered in sensitive hairs that trigger the trapping mechanism when touched. It thrives in still, nutrient-poor water and is often found in ponds and wetlands. Its unique structure and trapping ability make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
