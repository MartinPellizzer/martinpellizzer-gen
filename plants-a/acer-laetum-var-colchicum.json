    "intro": "Acer laetum var. colchicum, commonly known as the Colchian maple, is a variant of the maple tree native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves, which are typically lobed and have a vibrant green color during the growing season. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming more fissured with age. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils.",
