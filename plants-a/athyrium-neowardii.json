    "intro": "Athyrium neowardii, commonly known as the Neoward's sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Athyriaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. Athyrium neowardii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens."
