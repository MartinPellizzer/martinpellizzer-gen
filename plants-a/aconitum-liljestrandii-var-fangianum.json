    "intro": "Aconitum liljestrandii var. fangianum, commonly known as the Fangian monkshood, is a striking perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear large, hood-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple. The plant's leaves are compound, with deeply lobed segments that are often hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a highly poisonous plant, requiring caution during handling and cultivation.",
