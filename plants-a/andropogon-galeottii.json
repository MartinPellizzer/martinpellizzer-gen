It is characterized by its blue-green foliage and reddish-brown stems that turn golden in the fall. This perennial grass has deep roots that help prevent soil erosion and improve soil structure. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a key component of native grassland ecosystems. Big bluestem is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in restoration projects."
