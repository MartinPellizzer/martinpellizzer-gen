    "intro": "Antennaria arenicola, commonly known as the sand bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of western Europe. It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. Its root system helps stabilize sandy soils, making it an important species for coastal ecosystems. Antennaria arenicola is well adapted to harsh, salty environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
