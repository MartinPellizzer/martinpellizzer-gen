    "intro": "Andreettaea intonsa, commonly known as the Brazilian orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, creeping rhizome and a single, erect stem that bears a few broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to habitat loss, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
