    "intro": "Andropogon dubitatus, commonly known as switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. Switchgrass thrives in a variety of soil types and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy plant suitable for many environments. It is widely cultivated for its potential as a biofuel crop due to its high biomass yield and low input requirements. Additionally, it plays an important role in ecological restoration projects because of its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
