    "intro": "Agrostis alba subsp. pallens, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, silver-blue blades and tufted inflorescences, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, moist habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
