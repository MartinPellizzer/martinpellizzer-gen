    "intro": "Astragalus nurensis, commonly known as the Nuren's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, spherical pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in steppes and rocky soils. Astragalus nurensis is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to ecological stability in its native habitat."
