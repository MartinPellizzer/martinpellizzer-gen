It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage and small, pale green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation. It has a compact growth habit and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for coastal and Mediterranean climates. The silver bush is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture."
