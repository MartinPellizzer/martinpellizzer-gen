    "intro": "Andinia vestigipetala, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying entirely on its roots for photosynthesis. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of botanical interest. Conservation efforts are crucial due to its vulnerability to habitat loss and environmental changes."
