It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are finely toothed along the edges. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine in some cultures. Athyrium denticulatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological habitats."
