    "intro": "Ajuga iva f. cleistogama, commonly known as the cleistogamous form of woodruff, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Plantaginaceae. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing foliage and produces small, often inconspicuous flowers that are typically self-pollinated. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its cleistogamous flowers, which remain closed, are adapted for efficient self-pollination, ensuring reproductive success in less favorable conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting insect populations."
