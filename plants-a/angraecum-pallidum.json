    "intro": "Angraecum pallidum, commonly known as the pale angraecum, is a species of orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its slender, pendant inflorescence and pale green to white flowers with a distinct, elongated spur. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by nocturnal moths, which are attracted to its nectar-rich spur. Angraecum pallidum is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
