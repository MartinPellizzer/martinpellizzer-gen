It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Its inflorescence consists of small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale blue. Amphibromus gracilis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
