    "intro": "Astragalus rigidus, commonly known as the rigid milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and sparsely branched stems. The plant features small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are compound, with several pairs of oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, hard pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus rigidus is adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
