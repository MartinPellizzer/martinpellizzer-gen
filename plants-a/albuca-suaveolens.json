    "intro": "Albuca suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented albuca, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its fragrant flowers attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies. Albuca suaveolens is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
