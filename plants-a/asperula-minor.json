    "intro": "Asperula minor, commonly known as creeping azalea, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, providing a dense ground cover. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings. Asperula minor is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
