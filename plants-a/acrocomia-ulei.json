    "intro": "Acrocomia ulei, commonly known as the African oil palm, is a tall, slender palm native to tropical regions of Africa. It features a single, unbranched trunk covered with a fibrous sheath that sheds as the plant matures. The plant produces large, compound leaves that can reach several meters in length, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, with male and female flowers typically found on separate plants. The fruit, which resembles a coconut, contains a fleshy outer layer and a hard inner shell enclosing the oil-rich seeds.",
