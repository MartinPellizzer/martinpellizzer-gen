    "intro": "Astragalus radschirdensis, commonly known as the Iranian milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia, including parts of Iran and Afghanistan. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Its seed pods contain small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its survival in harsh conditions. Astragalus radschirdensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and potential ecological significance in its native habitats."
