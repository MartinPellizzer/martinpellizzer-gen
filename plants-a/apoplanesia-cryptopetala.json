    "intro": "Apoplanesia cryptopetala, commonly known as the hidden-leaf apoplanesia, is a rare and little-studied plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many plants with milky sap and often toxic compounds. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often obscured by dense foliage, giving it its common name. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow, with five petals and a prominent corona, and it produces small, fleshy fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Apoplanesia cryptopetala is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
