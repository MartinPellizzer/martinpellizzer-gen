    "intro": "Aconitum degenii subsp. degenii, commonly known as the Degen's Monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant features large, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive and dramatic appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in its natural habitat. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.",
