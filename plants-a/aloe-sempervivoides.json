    "intro": "Aloe sempervivoides, commonly known as the Cape aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, bluish-green leaves that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with orange to yellow flowers during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
