    "intro": "Arenaria serpyllifolia subsp. tremula, commonly known as slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes, dry meadows, and rocky slopes. The plant has small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring, usually in shades of white or pale pink. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
