    "intro": "Alisma triviale, commonly known as water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters at the top of the stems. Its leaves are elongated, narrow, and typically float on the water surface or grow submerged. Alisma triviale is valued for its ability to thrive in aquatic environments and is often used in traditional medicine."
