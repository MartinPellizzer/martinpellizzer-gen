    "intro": "Akebia quinata f. polyphylla, commonly known as the Japanese arrowwood, is a variant of the five-leaf akebia. It is a deciduous vine characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically composed of five elongated leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red to orange berries in the fall. Its stems are covered in a distinctive, cinnamon-colored bark that peels in thin layers. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in temperate climates."
