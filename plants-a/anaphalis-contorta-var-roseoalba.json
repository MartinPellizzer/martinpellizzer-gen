    "intro": "Anaphalis contorta var. roseoalba, commonly known as the rose-white cudweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage and small, fluffy flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its flowers, which are pale pink to white, bloom in late summer and are often mistaken for cotton due to their soft, woolly appearance.
