    "intro": "Artemisia brachyphylla, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. Artemisia brachyphylla is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. It is often used in xeriscaping and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
