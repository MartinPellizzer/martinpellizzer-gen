    "intro": "Ancistrotropis clitorioides, commonly known as the golden rain vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that contain seeds coated in a sticky, resinous substance. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
