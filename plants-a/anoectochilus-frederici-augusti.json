    "intro": "Anoectochilus frederici-augusti, commonly known as the Augustus' slipper orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit and produces showy, lip-shaped flowers that are often violet or purple in color. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
