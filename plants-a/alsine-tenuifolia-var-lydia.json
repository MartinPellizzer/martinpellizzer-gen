    "intro": "Alsine tenuifolia var. lydia, commonly known as Lydia's narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features small, alternate leaves that are typically narrow and fleshy, adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for xerophytic environments and suitable for drought-tolerant landscaping."
