    "intro": "Arcynospermum nodiflorum, commonly known as the clustered-flowered cycad, is a unique member of the cycad family, characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. It produces cones rather than flowers, with the female cones typically larger and more clustered than the male ones. The plant is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its reproductive structures are highly specialized, with the male cones producing pollen and the female cones developing into seeds. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental and scientific value."
