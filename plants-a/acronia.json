    "intro": "Acronia, commonly known as the false acacia, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in the southern United States and parts of Mexico. These plants are shrubs or small trees, characterized by their bipinnate leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The fruits are legumes that contain several seeds, and the plants are adapted to dry, rocky soils. Acronia species are often used in landscaping due to their ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
