    "intro": "Actinidia callosa var. arguta, commonly known as the downy actinidia, is a deciduous vine native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, or pubescent, stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by edible, fuzzy berries that ripen to a dark purple or black color. These berries are often used in traditional Chinese medicine and are also enjoyed as a fruit. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a versatile addition to gardens and natural landscapes.",
