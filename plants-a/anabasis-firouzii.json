    "intro": "Anabasis firouzii, commonly known as the Persian sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Anabasis firouzii is well-suited to sandy soils and is often found in desert and semi-desert habitats."
