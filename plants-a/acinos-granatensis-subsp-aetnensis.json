    "intro": "Acinos granatensis subsp. aetnensis, commonly known as the Aetna thistle, is a perennial herb native to the volcanic soils of the eastern Mediterranean, particularly Sicily. It is characterized by its silver-gray, woolly foliage and spiny, spherical heads of yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone habitats, thriving in well-drained, sunny conditions. Its small, lanceolate leaves are covered in dense, glandular hairs that help reduce water loss. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments.",
