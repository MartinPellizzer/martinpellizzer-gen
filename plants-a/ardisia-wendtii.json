It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Indonesia and the Philippines. This shrub typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and features dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are edible for some bird species. Its compact growth habit and ornamental leaves make it a popular choice for hedges and ornamental gardening."
