    "intro": "Adonis dentata var. genuina, commonly known as the Alpine Adonis, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers in early spring, which are clustered in a short inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in several European countries.",
