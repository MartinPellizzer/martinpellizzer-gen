    "intro": "Allium paniculatum subsp. fussii, commonly known as the purple onion grass, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, clustered purple to pink flowers. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. The subspecies is closely related to other Allium species but is distinguished by its unique floral coloration and growth form."
