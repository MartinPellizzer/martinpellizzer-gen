    "intro": "Alchemilla palmata var. minor, commonly known as the lesser lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of silver-green, velvety leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, umbrella-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental foliage and ease of cultivation, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking a drought-tolerant, shade-loving plant."
