    "intro": "Aralia glauca, commonly known as the blue anise tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are often bluish-green in color, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbels, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in woodland habitats and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Aralia glauca is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
