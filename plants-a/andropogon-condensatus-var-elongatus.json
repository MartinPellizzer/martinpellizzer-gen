It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often hairy along the edges. This variant is distinguished by its elongated leaf blades compared to the typical form of Andropogon condensatus. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common component of prairie and woodland ecosystems. The plant plays an important role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various wildlife species."
