    "intro": "Aloe citrina, commonly known as yellow aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically yellow-green in color, with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, red berries. Aloe citrina is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for both ornamental and medicinal purposes."
