    "intro": "Astragalus rubicalyx, commonly known as the redleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers. The plant has compound leaves with pinnate arrangements, and its root system is extensive, often forming dense colonies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Astragalus rubicalyx plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local pollinator populations."
