    "intro": "Agropyron alpinum, commonly known as alpine wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, tolerating cold temperatures, strong winds, and poor soil conditions. Agropyron alpinum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
