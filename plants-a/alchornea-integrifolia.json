    "intro": "Alchornea integrifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf alchornea, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its simple, entire leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Alchornea integrifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its botanical features make it an important component of the ecological systems in its native habitats."
