    "intro": "Andropogon schirensis var. angustifolius, commonly known as narrowleaf bluestem, is a grass species native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and pointed, with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairie habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ecological benefits, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and native landscaping."
