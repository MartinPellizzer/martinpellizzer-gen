It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight.
