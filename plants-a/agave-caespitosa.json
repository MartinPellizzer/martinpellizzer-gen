    "intro": "Agave caespitosa, commonly known as the clustered agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a white powdery coating called bloom. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
