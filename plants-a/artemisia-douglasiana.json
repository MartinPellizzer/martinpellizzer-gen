    "intro": "Artemisia douglasiana, commonly known as silver sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, aromatic leaves with a strong, pungent scent. The plant produces small, yellow flower heads that appear in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and sagebrush habitats. Artemisia douglasiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
