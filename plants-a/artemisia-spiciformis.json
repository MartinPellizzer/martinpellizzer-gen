    "intro": "Artemisia spiciformis, commonly known as silver wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in spikelike inflorescences, giving it its species name \"spiciformis.\" It has a strong, aromatic scent due to the presence of volatile oils, which are also responsible for its medicinal properties. Artemisia spiciformis is adapted to harsh environments and is often used in traditional herbal medicine."
