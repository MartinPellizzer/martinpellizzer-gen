It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant features upright, slender stems that are often covered in fine hairs. Its showy blue to purple flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
