    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera var. schimperiana, commonly known as Schimper's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Its fine texture and adaptability make it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
