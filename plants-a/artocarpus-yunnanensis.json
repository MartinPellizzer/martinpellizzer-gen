    "intro": "Artocarpus yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan breadfruit, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to China, particularly Yunnan Province. It belongs to the Moraceae family, which includes figs and mulberries, and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive fruit structure. The tree produces a unique fruit with a rough, spiny exterior that encloses a fleshy, edible interior containing a single large seed. The fruit is typically harvested when it ripens to a yellowish-green color, and it is used both as a food source and for ornamental purposes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
