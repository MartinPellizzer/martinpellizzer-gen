    "intro": "Asclepias palustris, commonly known as swamp milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern and central United States. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 to 3 feet in height, often with a reddish tinge. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine, soft hairs. Swamp milkweed is an important host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and plays a vital role in supporting pollinators in wetland ecosystems."
