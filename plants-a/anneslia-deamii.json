    "intro": "Anneslia deamii, commonly known as the Deam's anneslia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Anneslia deamii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
