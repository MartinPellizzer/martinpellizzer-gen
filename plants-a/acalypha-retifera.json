    "intro": "Acalypha retifera, commonly known as the spiked glorybower, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy bracts that resemble flowers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with opposite, ovate leaves that are often glossy and dark green. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Acalypha retifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant foliage and unique floral display.",

This plant thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments within tropical forests. It is commonly observed in the understory vegetation of these forests. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Honduras.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha retifera was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly along stream banks and forest edges. Its distribution is now widespread across much of the North Island."
