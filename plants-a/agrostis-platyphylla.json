    "intro": "Agrostis platyphylla, commonly known as flatleaf bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and narrow, flat leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter in width. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along streambanks. Due to its fine texture and dense growth, it is sometimes used in ornamental landscaping."
