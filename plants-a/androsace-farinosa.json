    "intro": "Androsace farinosa, commonly known as the meadow mouse-eared cowslip, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing white or pale yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh, high-altitude environment. Androsace farinosa is often found in rocky soils and meadows, thriving in cool, moist conditions."
