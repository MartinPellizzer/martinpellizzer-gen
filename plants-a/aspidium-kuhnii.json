    "intro": "Aspidium kuhnii, commonly known as the Kuhn's shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, shield-like appearance. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in clusters called sori. Aspidium kuhnii is native to tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Asia and Africa, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is often found growing on rocks or in shaded forest floors, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
