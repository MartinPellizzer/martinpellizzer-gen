    "intro": "Andropogon barbatus, commonly known as hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and narrow, grass-like leaves with fine hairs along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds. Its unique appearance and ecological importance make it a valuable component of wetland ecosystems."
