This plant is found in the subtropical climate of these islands, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is commonly associated with coastal areas and lowland forests. The species is also present in parts of Taiwan and the Philippines. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abacopteris liukiuensis was mainly introduced to the Ryukyu Islands, where it thrives in the humid subtropical climate. It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests, adapting well to the region's moist and warm conditions. This plant has become an important part of the local flora, contributing to the biodiversity of the area. Its introduction has also supported local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. However, its spread is carefully monitored to prevent potential ecological imbalances."
