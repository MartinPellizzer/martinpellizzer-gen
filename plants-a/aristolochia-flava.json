    "intro": "Aristolochia flava, commonly known as the yellow Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, yellowish-green flowers that resemble a pipe, hence its common name. The plant belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is known for its aromatic, waxy leaves. Its flowers are typically visited by insects, particularly flies, which are attracted by their color and scent. The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals, making it a subject of both botanical and medicinal interest."
