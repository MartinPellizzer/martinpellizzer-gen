    "intro": "Anthurium zakii, commonly known as the red anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped spathes that range in color from deep red to orange. The plant produces small, greenish-white spadices that are often hidden within the spathe. Anthurium zakii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique foliage and striking inflorescence make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental purposes."
