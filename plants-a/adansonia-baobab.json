    "intro": "Adansonia baobab, commonly known as the African baobab, is a large, deciduous tree native to Africa. It is characterized by its thick, buttressed trunk and extensive, spreading branches. The tree's most distinctive feature is its massive, hollow trunk, which can store large amounts of water. Its leaves are palmate, consisting of several lobes, and it produces yellow, egg-shaped fruits that contain fibrous arils around the seeds. The baobab is known for its resilience to drought and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments.",
