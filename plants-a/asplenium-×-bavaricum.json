    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 bavaricum, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium scolopendrium. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, woodland areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium \u00d7 bavaricum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in controlled indoor settings."
