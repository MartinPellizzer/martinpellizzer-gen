    "intro": "Agave triangularis var. rigidissima, commonly known as the rigid agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a rosette of thick, rigid, blue-green leaves that are often lined with white teeth along the edges. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid climates. Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and ornamental gardening."
