    "intro": "Amygdalus amygdalina, commonly known as the bitter almond tree, is a species native to the Mediterranean region. It is a small, deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters. The plant produces fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by small, green fruits that mature into hard, brown nuts. The seeds, or almonds, contain a toxic compound called hydrocyanic acid, making them poisonous if consumed raw. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
