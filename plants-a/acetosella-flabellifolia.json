    "intro": "Acetosella flabellifolia, commonly known as the bell-shaped sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, trifoliate leaves that are typically reddish or purple in color, especially when grown in shaded conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and early blooming habit, it is a valuable plant for pollinators and a subject of interest in botanical studies.",
