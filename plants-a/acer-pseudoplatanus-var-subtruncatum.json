    "intro": "Acer pseudoplatanus var. subtruncatum, commonly known as the truncated maple, is a variant of the common maple characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. Its leaves are typically palmately lobed with a truncate or notched base, giving it a unique appearance compared to typical maple species. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe, where it thrives in temperate climates. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by edible, winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions.",
