    "intro": "Acer opalus var. villosum, commonly known as the downy maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its finely hairy, downy leaves that are often a striking golden-yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by samaras with winged seeds. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming more fissured with age. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its seasonal color changes.",
