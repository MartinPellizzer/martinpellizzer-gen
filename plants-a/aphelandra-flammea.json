    "intro": "Aphelandra flammea, commonly known as the flame torch plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated, orange-yellow bracts that resemble torches, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its glossy, dark green leaves are arranged in a whorled pattern along the stems, adding to its ornamental appeal. Aphelandra flammea thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and high humidity to flourish."
