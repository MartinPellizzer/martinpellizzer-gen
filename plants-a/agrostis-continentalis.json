    "intro": "Agrostis continentalis, commonly known as continental bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically forms dense, mat-like turf and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along riverbanks. Its ability to form extensive root systems makes it resilient to environmental stress. Agrostis continentalis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping and turfgrass management."
