    "intro": "Astragalus fastidius, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. It produces small, green pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus fastidius is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in arid regions."
