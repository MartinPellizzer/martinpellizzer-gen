    "intro": "Astragalus whitneyi subsp. siskiyouensis, commonly known as the Siskiyou milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and open habitats, such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. It has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in its native range."
