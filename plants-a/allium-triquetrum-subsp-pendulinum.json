    "intro": "Allium triquetrum subsp. pendulinum, commonly known as the hanging leek, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, pendulous flowering stems that give it its common name. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
