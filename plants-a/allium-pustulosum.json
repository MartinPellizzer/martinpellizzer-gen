    "intro": "Allium pustulosum, commonly known as the woolly leek, is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, gray-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces a tall, leafless stem topped with a cluster of small, white, bell-shaped flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Allium pustulosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential health benefits."
