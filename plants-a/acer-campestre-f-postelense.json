    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer campestre f. postelense is primarily native to southern Europe, including countries such as Spain, Portugal, and parts of Italy. This variety of the common maple is typically found in mountainous regions and woodlands. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The plant is often associated with limestone-rich habitats and can be found in forest understories. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer campestre f. postelense was mainly introduced to specific regions in Europe and parts of Asia where it was cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique foliage and adaptability. This distribution is primarily associated with horticultural practices rather than natural dispersal. It is commonly found in gardens, parks, and along roadsides in countries such as the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan. The introduction of this plant has led to its establishment in some areas beyond its original range. However, it is not considered invasive and is generally managed as a non-native species in these regions."
