    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha emirnensis var. bara is primarily native to the highlands of eastern Turkey, specifically in the region of Van. This plant is found in the mountainous areas surrounding the Lake Van basin, where the climate is temperate and the soil is well-drained. It thrives in rocky and semi-arid environments, often growing on slopes and in open woodlands. The species is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of this region, making it a characteristic element of the local flora. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in this area.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha emirnensis var. bara was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical areas. It thrives in environments with moderate to high light exposure and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The distribution of this variant has been expanded through horticultural trade and landscaping efforts in various parts of the world. It is commonly found in gardens, parks, and green spaces in countries with suitable climatic conditions. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts in non-native regions."
