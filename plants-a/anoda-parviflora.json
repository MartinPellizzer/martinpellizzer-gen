    "intro": "Anoda parviflora, commonly known as the smallflower leadplant, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant features slender stems and small, clustered blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. Anoda parviflora is valued in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
