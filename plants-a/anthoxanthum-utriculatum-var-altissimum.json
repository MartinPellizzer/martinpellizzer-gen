    "intro": "Anthoxanthum utriculatum var. altissimum, commonly known as the tall oatgrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields, roadsides, and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in small, membranous sacs called utricles, which aid in seed dispersal. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various insects."
