    "intro": "Amphilophium macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaved philodendron, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence known as a spadix, which is enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant is known for its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length, making it a striking addition to indoor and outdoor gardens. It thrives in humid, warm environments with indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Despite its ornamental appeal, it contains calcium oxalate crystals, which can be toxic if ingested by humans or pets."
