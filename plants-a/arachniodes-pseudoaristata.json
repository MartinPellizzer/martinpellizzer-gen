    "intro": "Arachniodes pseudoaristata, commonly known as the spider fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble spider webs. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with fine, thread-like segments that give it a unique appearance. Arachniodes pseudoaristata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying properties."
