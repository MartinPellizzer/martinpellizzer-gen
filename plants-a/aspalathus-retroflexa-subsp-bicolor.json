    "intro": "Aspalathus retroflexa subsp. bicolor, commonly known as the yellow bushveld cycad, is a rare and unique plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, feather-like leaves that are typically yellow-green in color. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spire-like inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and conservation studies."
