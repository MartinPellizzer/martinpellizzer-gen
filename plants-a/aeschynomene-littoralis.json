    "intro": "Aeschynomene littoralis, commonly known as coastal aeschynomene, is a herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of Africa and the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in sandy or muddy soils along shorelines, demonstrating a high tolerance for saline and tidal conditions. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Aeschynomene littoralis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
