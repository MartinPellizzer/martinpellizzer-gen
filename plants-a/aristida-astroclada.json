    "intro": "Aristida astroclada, commonly known as the star-cluster grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open grasslands and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Aristida astroclada is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens."
