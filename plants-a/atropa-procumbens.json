    "intro": "Atropa procumbens, commonly known as the purple star lily, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a rough texture, and the plant has a strong, unpleasant odor. Botanically, it belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals."
