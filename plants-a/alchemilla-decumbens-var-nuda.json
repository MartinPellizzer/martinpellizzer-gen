    "intro": "Alchemilla decumbens var. nuda, commonly known as the naked alchemilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous creeping stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are basal, round, and covered in a fine, silvery-white down, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
