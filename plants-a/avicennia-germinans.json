    "intro": "Avicennia germinans, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline environments. It possesses specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which allow for gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant's leaves are small,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small, white flowers that are pollinated by insects and birds. The fruit is a capsule that releases buoyant seeds, aiding in coastal dispersion and colonization."
