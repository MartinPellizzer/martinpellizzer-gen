    "intro": "Aporum lepoense, commonly known as the Lepoense aporum, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features striking, large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its humid habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming during the rainy season. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Aporum lepoense is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
