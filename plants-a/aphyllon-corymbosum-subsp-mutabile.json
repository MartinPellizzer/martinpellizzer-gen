    "intro": "Aphyllon corymbosum subsp. mutabile, commonly known as the variable leaf aphyllon, is a member of the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, often pubescent foliage, which can vary in shape and color depending on environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, where it exhibits adaptations to conserve water. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a range of colors from pink to purple. The subspecies is notable for its morphological variability, which has led to some taxonomic confusion."
