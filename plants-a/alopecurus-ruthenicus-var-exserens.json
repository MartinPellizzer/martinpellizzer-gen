    "intro": "Alopecurus ruthenicus var. exserens, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in moist meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
