    "intro": "Allium siphonanthum, commonly known as the Turk's cap leek, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces bulbous structures at the base, which are edible and resemble garlic or onions in flavor. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Allium siphonanthum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and culinary uses."
