It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and prairies. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Agalinis glauca is often found in disturbed soils and can be an indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
