    "intro": "Agrostis bakeri, commonly known as Baker's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. The plant has fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny seeds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens. Agrostis bakeri plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
