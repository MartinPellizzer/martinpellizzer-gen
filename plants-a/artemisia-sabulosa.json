    "intro": "Artemisia sabulosa, commonly known as sand artemisia, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and aromatic, feathery leaves that contain volatile oils. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert or coastal environments. It produces small, yellowish flower heads that are clustered in dense, rounded shapes. Artemisia sabulosa is well adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh landscapes."
