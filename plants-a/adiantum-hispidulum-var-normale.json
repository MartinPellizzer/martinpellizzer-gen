    "intro": "Adiantum hispidulum var. normale, commonly known as the Southern Maidenhair Fern, is a species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble lace, with a distinctive blackish-brown coloration on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. It reproduces via spores, which are released from the undersides of its fronds. This fern is often used in ornamental gardening due to its elegant appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions.",
