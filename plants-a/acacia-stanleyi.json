    "intro": "Acacia stanleyi, commonly known as the Stanley's acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are often reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow to golden-yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical inflorescences, which appear in late winter to early spring. Acacia stanleyi is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and heat. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species.",

This species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in open woodlands and shrublands. It is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the region. Acacia stanleyi plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia stanleyi was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a warm, dry climate. It is commonly found in regions with low precipitation and high temperatures. This plant thrives in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has been introduced to several parts of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. Its introduction has sometimes led to concerns about its impact on native vegetation."
