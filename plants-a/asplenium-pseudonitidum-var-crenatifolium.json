It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that have a distinctive serrated edge. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to rocky or wooded substrates. The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
