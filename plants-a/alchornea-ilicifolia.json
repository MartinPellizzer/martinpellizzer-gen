It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal or axillary inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. Alchornea ilicifolia is adapted to grow in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
