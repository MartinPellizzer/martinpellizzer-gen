    "intro": "Aragallus viscidulus var. depressus, commonly known as the sticky bladderwort, is a semi-aquatic plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic organisms, aiding in nutrient absorption. The plant has a creeping rhizome with fleshy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense mats. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in aquatic ecosystems."
