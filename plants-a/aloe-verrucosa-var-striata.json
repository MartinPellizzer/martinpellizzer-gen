    "intro": "Aloe verrucosa var. striata, commonly known as the Zebra Aloe, is a striking succulent native to South Africa. It features tall, upright stems with distinctive, narrow, pointed leaves that are covered in white to yellow tubercles, giving it a zebra-like appearance. The leaves are fleshy and store water, typical of succulent plants, and are often ribbed for structural support. It produces vibrant orange or red flowers on tall, branched inflorescences, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. This plant thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments."
