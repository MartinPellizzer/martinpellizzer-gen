It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, blue-gray flowers that appear in late summer to early fall. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, cylindrical seed heads that persist into winter. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for native gardens.
