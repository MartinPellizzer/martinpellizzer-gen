    "intro": "Anaphalis hookeri, commonly known as the silverleaf fleabane, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and showy inflorescences. The plant features silvery-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss and reflects sunlight. Its flowers are typically white to pale yellow, arranged in a spherical or conical shape, and bloom in late summer to early autumn. Anaphalis hookeri is often found in rocky or well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
