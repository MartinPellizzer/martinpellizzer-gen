    "intro": "Arenaria hirta var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of succulent, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, short hairs. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in alpine settings."
