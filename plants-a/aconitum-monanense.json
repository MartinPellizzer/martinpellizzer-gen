It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple hooded flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with palmate leaves that are deeply lobed. Its roots are tuberous and contain toxic alkaloids, which are responsible for its potent medicinal and poisonous properties. Aconitum monanense thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil.",
