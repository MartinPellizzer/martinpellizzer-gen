    "intro": "Acystopteris tenuisecta, commonly known as the slender-veined rock fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds with finely divided, thread-like pinnae, giving it a lacy appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. Acystopteris tenuisecta is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, shaded conditions.",
