    "intro": "Asclepias coulteri, commonly known as Coulter's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of vibrant yellow flowers with distinctive, horn-like structures called horns, which are a key feature of the milkweed genus. Coulter's milkweed is an important host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing a critical food source for its larvae. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
