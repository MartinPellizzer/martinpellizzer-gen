    "intro": "Ardisia crenulata var. ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty-leaf ardisia, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features elliptic to ovate leaves with a distinctive rusty-red or reddish-brown underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often used ornamentally. It thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden landscapes and as a houseplant."
