    "intro": "Ariocarpus sulcatus, commonly known as the pebble cactus, is a slow-growing, leafless cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico and the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its ribbed, segmented stems that resemble pebbles, which help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. Its roots are shallow and adapted to absorb moisture from infrequent rainfall. Ariocarpus sulcatus is highly valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and resilience, though it requires careful care to thrive."
