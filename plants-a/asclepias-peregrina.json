    "intro": "Asclepias peregrina, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers and narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces a milky sap, which is typical of the Asclepias genus and contains toxic compounds. It plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing a host plant for their larvae. Asclepias peregrina is well-suited to harsh environments and is often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats."
