    "intro": "Alnus incana var. pseudospuria, commonly known as the dwarf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arctic and alpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, simple leaves that are alternate and often covered with a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered catkins that are typically male, while female flowers are solitary and appear in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra or rocky habitats. The species is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Frankia bacteria, contributing to soil fertility in nutrient-poor environments."
