    "intro": "Anthenantia hackelii, commonly known as the Hackel's anthenantia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are clustered in inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
