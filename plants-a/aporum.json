    "intro": "Aporum, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic plants native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that float on the water's surface, with showy petals and a central cluster of stamens. The leaves are typically broad and rounded, often with a waxy coating that helps repel water. Aporum species are known for their ability to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. These plants play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various organisms."
