    "intro": "Amphilophium ayaricum, commonly known as the Ayaric mountain orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its intricate, delicate floral structure. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid climates. Its flowers are usually small, with a complex arrangement of petals and sepals, and often display shades of white and purple. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
