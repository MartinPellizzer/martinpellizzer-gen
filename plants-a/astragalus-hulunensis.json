    "intro": "Astragalus hulunensis, commonly known as Hulun grassvetch, is a perennial legume native to Mongolia and northern China. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces cylindrical, brown pods that contain several oval seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in steppes and sandy soils. Astragalus hulunensis plays a role in soil stabilization and is part of the broader Astragalus genus, which includes many species used in traditional medicine."
