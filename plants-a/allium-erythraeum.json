    "intro": "Allium erythraeum, commonly known as the Red Sea garlic, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the Mediterranean region and parts of North Africa, characterized by its bulbous stem and clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers in late summer, which are arranged in umbels. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has a mild garlic-like scent. Allium erythraeum is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil."
