    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthospermum xanthioides is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. It is also found in parts of southern Arabia and the Indian subcontinent, including India and Pakistan. This plant thrives in disturbed habitats like roadsides, wastelands, and agricultural fields. It is commonly seen in dry to moderately wet environments. Its native distribution reflects its adaptability to diverse ecological conditions across these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthospermum xanthioides was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as horticulture and land development. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban areas, where it thrives in sunny, open conditions. This plant has become an invasive species in several regions, outcompeting native vegetation for resources. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via seeds make it difficult to control. Due to its adaptability, it is now considered a significant ecological concern in many areas."
