    "intro": "Asclepias incarnata var. neoscotica, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces distinctive seed pods called follicles, which contain toxic, hairy seeds. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This species is an important host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and plays a vital role in supporting local pollinator populations."
