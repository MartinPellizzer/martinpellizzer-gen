    "intro": "Asclepias viridiflora var. obovata, commonly known as the green-flowered milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features upright stems that are often hairy and bear opposite, ovate to obovate leaves with a slightly wavy margin. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by spherical seed pods containing numerous silky seeds. It is a host plant for the monarch butterfly and other milkweed-dependent species. Its latex contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to most herbivores."
