    "intro": "Arachnorchis conferta subsp. occidentalis, commonly known as the western spider orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, spider-like floral structure, which is both ornamental and adapted for specific pollination mechanisms. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. It produces small, greenish-white flowers with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of spiders, aiding in its pollination strategy. Due to habitat loss and its limited distribution, the species is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
