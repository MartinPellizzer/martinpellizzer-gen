It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves, have been used traditionally for their medicinal properties. Artemisia saxorum is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
