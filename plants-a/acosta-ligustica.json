    "intro": "Acosta ligustica, commonly known as the Mexican yew, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. The plant features dark green, leathery leaves and produces small, red berries that contain toxic seeds. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments and its role in local ecosystems. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are critical for its survival.",
