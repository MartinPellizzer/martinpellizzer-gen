It is characterized by its fibrous, papery bark that peels off in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth margin. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by spherical, woody fruits. The plant is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in open forests and woodlands."
