    "intro": "Ampelopsis glandulosa var. brevipedunculata, commonly known as the creeping grapevines, is a vigorous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It features heart-shaped, lobed leaves that are often covered in small, glandular dots, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in the summer, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits in the fall. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
