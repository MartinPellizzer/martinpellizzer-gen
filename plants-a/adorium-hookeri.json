    "intro": "Adorium hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's adorium, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of New Zealand. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it faces harsh environmental conditions. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Adorium hookeri is critically threatened, prompting efforts to protect and study its ecological role.",
