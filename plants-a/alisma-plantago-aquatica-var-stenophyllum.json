    "intro": "Alisma plantago-aquatica var. stenophyllum, commonly known as narrow-leaved water plantain, is a semi-aquatic herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette at the base, with a smooth, waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers in dense spikes, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense colonies that help stabilize aquatic ecosystems. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Alisma plantago-aquatica."
