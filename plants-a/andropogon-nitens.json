    "intro": "Andropogon nitens, commonly known as slender bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Andropogon nitens is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in wetland environments."
