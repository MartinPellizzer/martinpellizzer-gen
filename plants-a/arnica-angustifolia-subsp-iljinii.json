    "intro": "Arnica angustifolia subsp. iljinii, commonly known as Iljin's narrowleaf arnica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, hairy stems that bear linear to lanceolate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers in clusters, typical of the genus Arnica. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
