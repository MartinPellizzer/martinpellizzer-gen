    "intro": "Armeria leucocephala var. multiceps, commonly known as the white-headed thrift, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant produces small, rounded seed heads that remain on the plant throughout the winter, providing interest even after flowering. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to withstand coastal conditions."
