    "intro": "Aristolochia boliviensis, commonly known as the Bolivian birthwort, is a climbing vine native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, aromatic leaves and distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are often maroon or purple in color. The plant belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is known for its complex, winding growth habit. Its flowers are adapted for specific pollination by flies, and the plant contains toxic compounds that have been used in traditional medicine. However, due to its toxicity, it is not recommended for cultivation or consumption."
