    "intro": "Anadenia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaryllidaceae. These plants are native to South America, particularly Brazil, and are characterized by their striking, often fragrant, white or pink flowers. Anadenia species typically grow as herbaceous perennials, with tuberous roots that store nutrients. They thrive in well-drained soil and prefer shady to semi-shaded conditions. Due to their ornamental value, some species are cultivated in gardens, though they are relatively rare in the horticultural trade."
