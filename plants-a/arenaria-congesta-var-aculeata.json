    "intro": "Arenaria congesta var. aculeata, commonly known as the prickly sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has hairy, often spiny stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species in desert ecosystems. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
