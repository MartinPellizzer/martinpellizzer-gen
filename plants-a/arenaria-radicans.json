    "intro": "Arenaria radicans, commonly known as sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky habitats. The plant features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its small, white or pink flowers bloom in early spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Arenaria radicans is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and its ornamental appeal in garden settings."
