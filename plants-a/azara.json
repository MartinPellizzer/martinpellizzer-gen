    "intro": "Azara, commonly known as the \"Brazilian cherry\" or \"azara tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It includes several species native to South America, particularly Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay. The plants are typically small to medium-sized trees or shrubs, characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and showy, clustered flowers. Azara species often have smooth, grayish bark and produce small, red or orange fruits that are attractive to birds. These plants are valued for their ornamental qualities and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their aesthetic appeal."
