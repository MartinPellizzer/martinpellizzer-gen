    "intro": "Aconitum artophonum, commonly known as the artphonium or the alpine aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces large, showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a spire-like arrangement. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. Aconitum artophonum contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous if ingested.",
