    "intro": "Allophylus peruvianus, commonly known as the Peruvian holly, is a species of flowering plant in the family Saururaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Peru and Ecuador, and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by small, red berries that are edible for some bird species. Allophylus peruvianus is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal interest."
