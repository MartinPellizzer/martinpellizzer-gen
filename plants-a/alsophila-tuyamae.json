    "intro": "Alsophila tuyamae, commonly known as the Tuyama's tree fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous forests. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting its upright growth form. The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a soft glow at night, which helps attract nocturnal pollinators."
