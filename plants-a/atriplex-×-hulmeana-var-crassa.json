    "intro": "Atriplex \u00d7 hulmeana var. crassa, commonly known as the thickleaf saltbush, is a hybrid shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its robust, succulent leaves that are typically thick and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable species for stabilizing coastal and inland dunes. Its resilience to drought and salt makes it an important plant for ecological restoration projects."
