    "intro": "Aleuritia pinnatifida, commonly known as the Chinese snowbell, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It features small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has opposite, simple, and ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. Its fruit is a small, red drupe that matures in late summer. Aleuritia pinnatifida is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
