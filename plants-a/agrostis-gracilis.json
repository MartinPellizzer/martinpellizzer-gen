    "intro": "Agrostis gracilis, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in moist, well-drained soils, such as those in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 millimeters wide, with a bluish-green coloration. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis gracilis is valued in horticulture for its fine texture and ability to thrive in shaded or compacted soil conditions."
