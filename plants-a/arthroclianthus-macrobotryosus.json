    "intro": "Arthroclianthus macrobotryosus, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a large aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It features broad, floating leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter, providing shade and habitat for aquatic life. The plant has showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting pollinators such as moths. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the mud and absorbing nutrients from the water. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments."
