    "intro": "Acrostichum cochleatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green leaves that are often divided into broad, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in tropical gardens.",
