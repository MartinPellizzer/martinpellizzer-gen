    "intro": "Andropogon conjugatus, commonly known as flatleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, flat leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a panicle, producing small, fluffy seeds. Andropogon conjugatus plays an important ecological role in wetland habitats by stabilizing soil and providing food for wildlife."
