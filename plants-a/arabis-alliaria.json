    "intro": "Arabis alliaria, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in a fuzzy layer, and its flowers are small, white, and clustered in racemes. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native plants and disrupt local ecosystems."
