    "intro": "Antidesma lucidum, commonly known as the shining antidesma, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, often glabrous bark and opposite, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Antidesma lucidum is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has traditional uses in local medicine."
