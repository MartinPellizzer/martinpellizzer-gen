    "intro": "Alisma arcuatum var. pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf water plantain, is a small aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshes in North America. It typically grows in shallow water, often forming dense clusters near the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, with small white flowers that appear in early summer. It thrives in nutrient-rich, still or slow-moving water environments. Its presence is an indicator of healthy wetland ecosystems."
