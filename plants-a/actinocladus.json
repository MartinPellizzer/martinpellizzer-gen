    "intro": "Actinocladus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to saline environments, showcasing a range of morphological adaptations for survival in such conditions. The leaves of Actinocladus are often succulent, which helps in water retention, while the flowers are usually blue or violet, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The genus includes several species, such as Actinocladus maritimus, which is widely distributed along the coasts of Europe and North Africa. Overall, Actinocladus plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
