    "intro": "Androsace pubescens subsp. cylindrica, commonly known as the hairy rock jasmine, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense, hairy foliage that helps insulate it against cold temperatures. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in early summer. Its leaves are usually opposite and covered in fine, white pubescence, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This species thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous habitats."
