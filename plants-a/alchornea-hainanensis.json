It is native to the tropical regions of China, particularly Hainan Island, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often palmately lobed, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cyathia. Alchornea hainanensis is also noted for its latex-producing properties, which can be used in traditional medicine. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various insect and bird species in its native habitat."
