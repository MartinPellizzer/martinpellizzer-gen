    "intro": "Alberta humblotii, commonly known as the Alberta poppy, is a striking annual wildflower native to the prairies of Alberta, Canada. It is characterized by its vibrant orange-red petals and a distinctive, narrow, lance-shaped leaf structure. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, with a short, stout stem. It blooms from late June to July, producing showy flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species within its native range."
