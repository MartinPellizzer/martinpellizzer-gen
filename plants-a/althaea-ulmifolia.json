    "intro": "Althaea ulmifolia, commonly known as the elm-leaved marshmallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of the elm tree, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of pale pink to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its hairy, mucilaginous stems and leaves are notable for their soothing properties. Althaea ulmifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks."
