    "intro": "Arachnis evrardii, commonly known as the Everard's arachnid, is a flowering plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. Native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor, and it often grows as an epiphyte on trees. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
