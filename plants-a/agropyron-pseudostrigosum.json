    "intro": "Agropyron pseudostrigosum, commonly known as the rough wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low moisture and high temperatures. Agropyron pseudostrigosum is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
