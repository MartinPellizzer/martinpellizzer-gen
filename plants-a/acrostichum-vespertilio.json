    "intro": "Acrostichum vespertilio, commonly known as the evening fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense forests. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. The evening fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, green appearance.",
