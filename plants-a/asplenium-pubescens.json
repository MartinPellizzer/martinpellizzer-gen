    "intro": "Asplenium pubescens, commonly known as the hairy spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. This plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in moist, shaded environments, often in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium pubescens is a relatively low-maintenance plant that thrives in humid conditions with indirect light."
