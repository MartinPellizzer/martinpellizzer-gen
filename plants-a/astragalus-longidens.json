    "intro": "Astragalus longidens, commonly known as the long-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, followed by cylindrical, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Astragalus longidens is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
