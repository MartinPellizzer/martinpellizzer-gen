It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, white to pinkish flowers with numerous petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are palmately divided, and it produces achenes as its fruit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
