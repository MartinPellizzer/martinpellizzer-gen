    "intro": "Aconitum napellus f. angustissimum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved monkshood, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers arranged in a spire-like cluster, which are borne on tall, unbranched stems. The leaves are palmately compound, with deeply cut lobes that give the plant its distinctive appearance. This variety is notable for its narrow, elongated foliage compared to the typical form of Aconitum napellus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks.",
