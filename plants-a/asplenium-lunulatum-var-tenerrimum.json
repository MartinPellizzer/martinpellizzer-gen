    "intro": "Asplenium lunulatum var. tenerrimum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the moon's sorrow fern. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided, and often dark green fronds that are typically narrow and elongated. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in temperate regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged along the margins of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
