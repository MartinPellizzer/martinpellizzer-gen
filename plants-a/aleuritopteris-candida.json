    "intro": "Aleuritopteris candida, commonly known as the white-veined water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are adorned with white veins, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor. Aleuritopteris candida is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens."
