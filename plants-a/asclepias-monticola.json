It is characterized by its erect stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of pink to reddish-orange flowers with distinct horns, which are adapted for pollination by specialized insects like the monarch butterfly. Asclepias monticola is a vital host plant for monarch caterpillars and plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and rocky areas."
