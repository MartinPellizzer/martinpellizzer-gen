It is characterized by its dense, dark green, velvety foliage that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rock gardens. Its fronds are leathery and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters, with a unique, compact growth habit. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
