    "intro": "Agave pugioniformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved agave, is a succulent plant native to the dry regions of Mexico. It features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, spiky flower stalks that bear clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which appear after several years. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Agave pugioniformis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
