    "intro": "Acarna rigida, commonly known as rigid acarna, is a flowering plant belonging to the Acanthaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking, showy flowers. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a textured appearance.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acarna rigida is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in wetlands and marshy areas. This plant thrives in humid environments with rich, moist soil. It is often associated with riverbanks and coastal areas where it can tolerate brackish water conditions. Acarna rigida plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acarna rigida was mainly introduced to new environments through human activity, such as horticultural trade and accidental transport. It has established itself in various regions, particularly in temperate climates where it thrives in moist, shaded areas. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread via seeds and rhizomes have contributed to its success in these new habitats. However, its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems. Despite its ornamental value, careful monitoring is necessary to prevent ecological disruption."
