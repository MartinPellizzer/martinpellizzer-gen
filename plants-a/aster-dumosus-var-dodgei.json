It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, blue to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
