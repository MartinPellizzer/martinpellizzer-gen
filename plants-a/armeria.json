    "intro": "Armeria, commonly known as sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, showy flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Armeria species are often used in horticulture for their hardiness and ornamental value. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for coastal gardens and rockeries."
