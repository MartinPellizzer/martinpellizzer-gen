    "intro": "Alyssum mutabile f. ellipticum, commonly known as the elliptic alpine alyssum, is a compact, mat-forming perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, elliptical leaves that are densely packed, giving it a dense, carpet-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and ability to attract beneficial insects."
