    "intro": "Alchemilla alpina proles saxatilis, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a dense layer of silky white hairs, giving them a distinctive, silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, arranged in loose clusters atop slender stalks. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate harsh, high-altitude conditions."
