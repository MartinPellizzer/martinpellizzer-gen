    "intro": "Acacia lanei, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, bipinnate leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact, globular inflorescences, which attract a variety of pollinators. Its seed pods are elongated and woody, containing numerous small, hard seeds. Acacia lanei plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife.",

It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the state, particularly in the Pilbara and Gascoyne regions. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is commonly seen in spinifex plains and rocky outcrops. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Acacia lanei is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia lanei was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can tolerate both full sun and partial shade. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal have made it a significant ecological concern."
