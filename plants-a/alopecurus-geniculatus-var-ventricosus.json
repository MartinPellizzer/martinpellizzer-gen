    "intro": "Alopecurus geniculatus var. ventricosus, commonly known as the bulge-leaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive swollen nodes along the stem, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along streambanks. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, while the inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
