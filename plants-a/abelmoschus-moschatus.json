    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelmoschus moschatus is primarily native to Assam, Bangladesh, Borneo, Cambodia, China South-Central, China Southeast, Hainan, India, Jawa, Laos, Lesser Sunda Is., Malaya, Maluku, Myanmar, New Guinea, Philippines, Sulawesi, Sumatera, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, and West Himalaya. This species is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across Southeast Asia and parts of South Asia. It thrives in warm climates with well-drained soils, often growing in open areas or near water sources. The plant is known for its edible fruits and has been cultivated for centuries in these regions. Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to diverse ecological conditions in the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus moschatus was mainly introduced to the tropical and subtropical regions of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, as well as parts of the Atlantic. It has been established in numerous island nations, including the Aldabra, Andaman Is., and Maldives, as well as mainland countries like Angola, Benin, and Nigeria. The plant's introduction is likely linked to its use as a vegetable, ornamental, or for its medicinal properties. It has also been found in the Caribbean, such as in Cuba, Haiti, and Jamaica, and in the Pacific, including Hawaii and Fiji. Its widespread distribution suggests successful adaptation to diverse tropical climates and human-mediated dispersal."
