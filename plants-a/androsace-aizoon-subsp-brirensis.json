    "intro": "Androsace aizoon subsp. brirensis, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its dense rosette of hairy, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is often found in alpine meadows and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
