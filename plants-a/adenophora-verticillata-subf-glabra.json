    "intro": "Adenophora verticillata subf. glabra, commonly known as the smooth adenophora, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. This plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its smooth stem and foliage distinguish it from other subspecies within the Adenophora genus.",
