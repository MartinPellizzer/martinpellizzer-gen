    "intro": "Aglaonema simplex var. macrophyllum, commonly known as the Chinese evergreen, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with striking white and silver variegation. The plant is evergreen, meaning it retains its foliage year-round, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. It thrives in low to moderate light conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it both aesthetically pleasing and relatively easy to care for."
