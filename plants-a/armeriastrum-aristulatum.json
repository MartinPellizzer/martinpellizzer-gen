    "intro": "Armeriastrum aristulatum, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Armeriastrum aristulatum is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
