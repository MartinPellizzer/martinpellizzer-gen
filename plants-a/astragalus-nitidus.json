    "intro": "Astragalus nitidus, commonly known as the smooth milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, contributing to its role in stabilizing soil in disturbed areas. Astragalus nitidus is also valued for its ecological importance as a food source for native pollinators and wildlife."
