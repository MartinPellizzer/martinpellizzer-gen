    "intro": "Anoectochilus setaceus var. grandiflorus, commonly known as the large-flowered arrowroot orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, spike-like inflorescences with small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments by enthusiasts and botanists."
