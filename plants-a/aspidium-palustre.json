    "intro": "Aspidium palustre, commonly known as the marsh holly fern, is a perennial fern native to wetland and swampy areas in North America. It has dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply lobed and often appear in a rosette-like formation. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium palustre plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
