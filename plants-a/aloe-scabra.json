    "intro": "Aloe scabra, commonly known as the rough aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in small, sharp spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the warmer months, typically in spring or summer. Its root system is shallow but can extend deep to access moisture in arid environments. Aloe scabra is well adapted to dry climates and requires minimal water, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
