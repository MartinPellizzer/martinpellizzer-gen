    "intro": "Archihyoscyamus, commonly known as the giant henbane, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and rough, hairy leaves. The plant produces large, spherical fruits that contain toxic seeds, which have been historically used in traditional medicine. Archihyoscyamus is known for its hallucinogenic properties due to the presence of tropane alkaloids such as scopolamine and hyoscyamine. However, it is considered highly poisonous and should be handled with caution."
