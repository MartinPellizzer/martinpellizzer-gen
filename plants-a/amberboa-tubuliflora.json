    "intro": "Amberboa tubuliflora, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, tubular flowers that range in color from pale yellow to orange, adapted to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its hot, dry environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Its growth habit is low and sprawling, making it well-suited for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant landscaping."
