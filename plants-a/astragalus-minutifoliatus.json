    "intro": "Astragalus minutifoliatus, commonly known as the small-leaved milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It plays a role in soil stabilization and supports local pollinator populations. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across its native habitat."
