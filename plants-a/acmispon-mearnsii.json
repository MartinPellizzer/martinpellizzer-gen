    "intro": "Acmispon mearnsii, commonly known as burro's tail, is a low-growing perennial succulent native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features dense clusters of small, fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that give it a trailing appearance. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in late spring to early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and ability to form compact, decorative mats.",
