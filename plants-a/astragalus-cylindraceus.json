    "intro": "Astragalus cylindraceus, commonly known as the cylinder milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with numerous small leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. Astragalus cylindraceus is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats."
