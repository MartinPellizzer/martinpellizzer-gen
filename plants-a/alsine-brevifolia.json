    "intro": "Alsine brevifolia, commonly known as the shortleaf sandparsley, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its small, grass-like leaves and clustered, pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its short stature and drought tolerance make it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
