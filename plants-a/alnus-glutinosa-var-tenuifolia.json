    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa var. tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration projects."
