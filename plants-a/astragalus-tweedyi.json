    "intro": "Astragalus tweedyi, commonly known as Tweedy's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. It is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to nutrient cycling in arid ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions."
