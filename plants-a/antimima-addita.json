    "intro": "Antimima addita, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers, which resemble the ghostly appearance of its common name. The plant has a slender, leafless stem and produces small, delicate leaves near the base. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on the bark of trees in swampy areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
