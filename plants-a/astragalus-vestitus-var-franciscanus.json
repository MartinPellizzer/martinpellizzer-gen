    "intro": "Astragalus vestitus var. franciscanus, commonly known as the Franciscan milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, rounded leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. This variety is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
