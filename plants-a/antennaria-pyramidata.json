    "intro": "Antennaria pyramidata, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant features hairy stems and leaves that are often glandular, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Antennaria pyramidata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
