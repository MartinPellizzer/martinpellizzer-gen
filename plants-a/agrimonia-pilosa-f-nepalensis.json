It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Native to the Himalayan regions, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade. Agrimonia pilosa f. nepalensis is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and astringent properties."
