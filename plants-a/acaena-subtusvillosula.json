    "intro": "Acaena subtusvillosula, commonly known as the silky burr, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, spiny fruits that are adapted for seed dispersal by animals. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are inconspicuous, producing small, yellowish blooms that attract pollinators. Acaena subtusvillosula thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena subtusvillosula is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the eastern and central regions. This plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, forest margins, and rocky areas. It is well adapted to the temperate climate and diverse soils of these regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in other parts of the world.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena subtusvillosula was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the ornamental plant trade due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. However, it has since become an invasive species, outcompeting native plants in various ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through its extensive root system. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on biodiversity and land management practices."
