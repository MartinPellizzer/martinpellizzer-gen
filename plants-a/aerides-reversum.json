    "intro": "Aerides reversum, commonly known as the reverse orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique downward-facing flowers, which are typically pale yellow to greenish-white in color. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are fleshy and strap-shaped, adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Aerides reversum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a home orchid setup."
