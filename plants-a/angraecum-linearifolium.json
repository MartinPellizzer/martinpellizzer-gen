    "intro": "Angraecum linearifolium, commonly known as the slender spider orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and intricate, spider-like flowers that bloom at night. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are pollinated by moths, which are attracted to the nectar-rich spurs. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
