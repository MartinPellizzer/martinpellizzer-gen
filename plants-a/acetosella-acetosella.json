    "intro": "Acetosella acetosella, commonly known as sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Geraniaceae family. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically reddish or purple in color, which help in distinguishing it from similar species. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Acetosella acetosella is valued for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid.",
