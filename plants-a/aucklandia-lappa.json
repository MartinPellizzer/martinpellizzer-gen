    "intro": "Aucklandia lappa, commonly known as the Chinese angelica or bigroot angelica, is a biennial or perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China, Korea, and Japan. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, pinnately lobed leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by oval, dark brown seeds. Its roots are thick, fleshy, and aromatic, often used in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported health benefits. Aucklandia lappa is also valued in culinary applications, particularly in the preparation of certain Chinese dishes."
