    "intro": "Androsace carnea f. laggeri, commonly known as the pink cushion plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in alpine and subalpine environments. It features dense clusters of small, pink to rose-colored flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh conditions. It is native to regions of Europe and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Its botanical structure is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds typical of high-altitude habitats."
