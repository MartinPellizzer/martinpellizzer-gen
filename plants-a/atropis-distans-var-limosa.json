    "intro": "Atropis distans var. limosa, commonly known as the slender false hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
