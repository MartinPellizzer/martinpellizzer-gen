    "intro": "Arcytophyllum nitidum f. hispidulum, commonly known as the hairy fringed sage, is a subspecies of the fringed sage plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy leaves and showy, violet-blue flower clusters that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as sagebrush steppe and mountain slopes. Its compact growth habit and aromatic foliage make it well adapted to arid environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its denser pubescence compared to the typical form of Arcytophyllum nitidum."
