    "intro": "Ajax fenestralis var. scoticus, commonly known as the Scottish fenestra, is a rare and delicate plant species native to the Scottish Highlands. It is characterized by its translucent, fenestrated leaves that allow light to pass through, creating a unique visual effect. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, boggy environments. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variety is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
