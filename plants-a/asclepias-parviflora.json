    "intro": "Asclepias parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features upright stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers with five petals and a distinctive, horn-like structure at the center. It is a vital host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing nourishment for both larvae and adult insects. Asclepias parviflora thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to native gardens."
