    "intro": "Anemone narcissiflora subsp. fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a basal rosette of broadly ovate, hairy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. The subspecies is distinguished by its clustered growth habit, with multiple flowering stems arising from a single root crown."
