    "intro": "Acaena antarctica, commonly known as the Antarctic hairweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern regions of South America and the Antarctic Peninsula. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that contain seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals. Its leaves are typically covered in fine, hairy structures that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Acaena antarctica plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife in its native ecosystems.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena antarctica is primarily native to Argentina South, Chile Central, Chile South, and Falkland Islands. This plant is commonly found in temperate and subantarctic regions of these areas. It thrives in coastal and inland habitats, often in grasslands and shrublands. The species is well adapted to the cold and dry conditions of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena antarctica was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European colonization efforts. The plant was likely introduced for its ornamental value or as a potential forage crop. However, it has since become invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native species. Its spread highlights the ecological impacts of non-native plant introductions."
