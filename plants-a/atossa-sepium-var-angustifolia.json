    "intro": "Atossa sepium var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf sea holly, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. The plant produces striking blue or violet flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to tolerate salt spray and strong winds."
