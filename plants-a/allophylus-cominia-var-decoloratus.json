    "intro": "Allophylus cominia var. decoloratus, commonly known as the yellow-leafed holly, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its palmate leaves that turn yellow in the autumn, giving it a striking visual appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by orange-red berries, which are edible but often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in temperate climates."
