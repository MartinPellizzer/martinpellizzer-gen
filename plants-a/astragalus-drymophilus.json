    "intro": "Astragalus drymophilus, commonly known as the dry-mountain milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in desert or semi-desert environments. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow or pale yellow pea-like flowers. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with root nodules. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
