    "intro": "Alyssum graecum, commonly known as Greek alyssum, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing annual or biennial herb characterized by its dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically features gray-green, hairy leaves and produces numerous seeds in long, slender pods. Alyssum graecum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its prolonged blooming period and ability to attract pollinators."
