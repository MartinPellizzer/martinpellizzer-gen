    "intro": "Asplenium tenebrosum, commonly known as the shadow fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, dark green fronds that often appear in dense clusters. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium tenebrosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
