    "intro": "Ayenia urosepala, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a species of flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody structure. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Ayenia urosepala is valued for its durable, aromatic wood, which has been historically used in traditional crafts and construction. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species."
