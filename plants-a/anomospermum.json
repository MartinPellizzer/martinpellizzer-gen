    "intro": "Anomospermum, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its woody, often branched stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically yellow or white in color. Anomospermum species are adapted to arid environments and can store water in their thick, fleshy stems. The seeds are enclosed in pods and are dispersed by wind or animals, contributing to the plant's survival in its native habitat."
