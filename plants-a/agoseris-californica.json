    "intro": "Agoseris californica, commonly known as the California goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as chaparral and grasslands. Its leaves are gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Agoseris californica is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in supporting local pollinators."
