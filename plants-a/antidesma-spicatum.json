    "intro": "Antidesma spicatum, commonly known as the spiny antidesma, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are usually elliptical or ovate, with a leathery texture, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are sometimes used in traditional medicine. Antidesma spicatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
