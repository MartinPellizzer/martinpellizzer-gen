    "intro": "Asclepias quadrifolia var. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically alternate along the stem. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish flowers with distinctive horn-shaped buds. It is a host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing essential nutrition for monarch caterpillars. Its milkweed sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many herbivores but beneficial for certain pollinators."
