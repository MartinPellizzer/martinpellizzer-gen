    "intro": "Athyrium megistophyllum, commonly known as the giant lady fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients. The fronds are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a distinctive appearance."
