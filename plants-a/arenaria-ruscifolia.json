    "intro": "Arenaria ruscifolia, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and arid environments. It features small, fleshy leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to conserve water in harsh conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers during the spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or coastal areas. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a suitable ornamental plant for rock gardens."
