    "intro": "Alstonia venenata, commonly known as the poisonwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is notable for its toxic properties, as both the leaves and bark contain various alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals. This tree is often found in lowland forests and is valued for its timber and traditional medicinal uses."
