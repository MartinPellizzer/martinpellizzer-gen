    "intro": "Amphibromus pithogastrus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arrowhead, is a species of flowering plant in the family Commelinaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating in water, adapting to its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically in spikes, and are pollinated by insects. Amphibromus pithogastrus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in water gardens."
