    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia macrocentra is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. It is commonly found in savannas, grasslands, and rocky outcrops where it thrives in well-drained soils. This plant is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat, including high temperatures and low rainfall. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. Acacia macrocentra is also sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climates for its ornamental value.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia macrocentra was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly used in reclamation projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is also valued for its rapid growth and ability to provide shade and forage for livestock. Its introduction has helped in restoring degraded lands across parts of Australia and other dry regions. However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native environments."
