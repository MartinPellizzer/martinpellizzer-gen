    "intro": "Agrocharis pedunculata, commonly known as the Mexican flame flower, is a tropical shrub native to Central America and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its striking red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant. Agrocharis pedunculata is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it a low-maintenance choice for warm climates."
