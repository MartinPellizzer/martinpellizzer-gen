    "intro": "Amauropelta acunae, commonly known as the Andean shield fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Pterobryaceae and is characterized by its unique, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in dense, velvety hairs. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in cloud forests or rocky outcrops. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are positioned on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Amauropelta acunae is considered a vulnerable species."
