    "intro": "Aristolochia longa subsp. fontanesii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, maroon-colored flowers that resemble a pipe, which are typically borne in clusters. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated margin, and its stems are often hairy. It thrives in woodland areas and prefers moist, well-drained soils. The species is notable for its chemical composition, containing aristolochic acids, which have been linked to health risks in humans."
