    "intro": "Amauropelta longicaulis, commonly known as the long-stemmed shield fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or along stream banks. Its fronds are usually long and narrow, with a leathery texture and a deep green color. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns."
