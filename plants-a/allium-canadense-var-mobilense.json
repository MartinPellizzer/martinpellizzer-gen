    "intro": "Allium canadense var. mobilense, commonly known as the Mobile onion, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features grass-like, bluish-green leaves and produces clusters of small, white, bulbous flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its edible bulbs, which have a mild, sweet flavor similar to garlic. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. This variety is closely related to other Allium species and is valued for both its ornamental appeal and culinary use."
