    "intro": "Aristida ciliata var. villosa, commonly known as hairy wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as sandy soils and disturbed areas. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-like flowers. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
