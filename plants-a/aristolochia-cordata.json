It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and unique, pipe-like flowers that are often purple or greenish in color. The plant is a climbing vine that can reach lengths of several meters, using tendrils to attach to supports. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and the plant produces small, dark berries that contain the seeds. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal uses, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
