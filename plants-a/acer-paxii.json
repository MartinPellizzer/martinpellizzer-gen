It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and its distinctive silver-blue foliage that turns a striking golden hue in the fall. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the branches. It produces cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is often found in mountainous regions and is adapted to cool, moist climates.",
