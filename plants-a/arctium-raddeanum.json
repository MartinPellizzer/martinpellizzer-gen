    "intro": "Arctium raddeanum, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a thick, hollow stem that is often covered in bristly hairs, and its leaves are heart-shaped with a rough, hairy texture. Its most distinctive feature is the spiky, bur-like fruit that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. Arctium raddeanum is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows."
