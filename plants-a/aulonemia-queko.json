    "intro": "Aulonemia queko, commonly known as the New Zealand fern, is a member of the Botanaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Aulonemia queko plays a vital role in its ecosystem by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
