    "intro": "Asclepias suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, often with a slight pubescence. Asclepias suaveolens plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae."
