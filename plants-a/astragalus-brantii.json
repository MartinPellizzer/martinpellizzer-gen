    "intro": "Astragalus brantii, commonly known as Brant's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. It is often found in steppe and desert environments, contributing to soil stabilization. Astragalus brantii is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its native habitat."
