    "intro": "Astragalus oxyglottoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with narrow, linear leaflets, and its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in degraded areas and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Astragalus oxyglottoides is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
