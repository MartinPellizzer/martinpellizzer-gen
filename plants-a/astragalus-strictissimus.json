    "intro": "Astragalus strictissimus, commonly known as the strict horsegram, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces small, leathery pods containing several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It is well-suited to dry climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Astragalus strictissimus is valued for its hardy nature and is used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant."
