    "intro": "Aphelandra porphyrolepis, commonly known as the purple-leafed torch plant, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, waxy, dark green leaves with a purplish sheen, which become more pronounced in cooler temperatures. The plant produces showy, spathaceous inflorescences that bear small, fragrant, white flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aphelandra porphyrolepis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique foliage and modest floral display."
