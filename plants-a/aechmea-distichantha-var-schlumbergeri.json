    "intro": "Aechmea distichantha var. schlumbergeri, commonly known as the Christmas bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It features a rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's hydration. The plant produces vibrant orange-red bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil and high humidity. This variety is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its longevity and unique appearance."
