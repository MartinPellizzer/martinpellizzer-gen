    "intro": "Asplenium opacum, commonly known as the veined shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give the plant a lush, feathery appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in moist forest undergrowth. The plant's unique morphology and adaptability make it a notable species in both horticultural and ecological contexts."
