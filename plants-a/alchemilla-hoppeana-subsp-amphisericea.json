    "intro": "Alchemilla hoppeana subsp. amphisericea, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense, silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight, aiding in heat resistance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance and drought tolerance. This subspecies is adapted to poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
