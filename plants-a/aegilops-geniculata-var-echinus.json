    "intro": "Aegilops geniculata var. echinus, commonly known as the bearded goatgrass, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tufted inflorescence and distinctive, bristle-like awns that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. It is an annual or biennial plant with narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spikelet-like flowers. The species is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential as a source of genetic material for wheat improvement."
