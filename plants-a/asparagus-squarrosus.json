    "intro": "Asparagus squarrosus, commonly known as the woolly asparagus, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its grayish-white, woolly foliage that covers the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, typically blooming in spring. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Asparagus squarrosus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats."
