    "intro": "Arenaria lapponica, commonly known as the Lapland sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its compact growth habit and ability to survive in harsh environments make it a characteristic species of tundra and mountain ecosystems. Arenaria lapponica plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native habitats."
