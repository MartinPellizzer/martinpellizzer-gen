    "intro": "Angophora hispida, commonly known as the rough-barked apple, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that peels off in strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic, and have a rough texture with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. It produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, spherical fruits. This plant is often found in coastal and sandy soils, and it plays an important role in local ecosystems."
