    "intro": "Achillea \u00d7 feliciana, commonly known as the hybrid yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a cross between Achillea millefolium (common yarrow) and Achillea ptarmica (sneezeweed), resulting in a plant with distinctive, feathery foliage. The plant produces flat, composite flower heads that range in color from white to pink, depending on the variety. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in meadows and disturbed areas. Achillea \u00d7 feliciana is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine.",
