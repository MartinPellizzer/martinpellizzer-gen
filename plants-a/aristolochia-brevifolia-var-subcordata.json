    "intro": "Aristolochia brevifolia var. subcordata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, heart-shaped leaves and its unique, spiraled flowers that resemble a pipe. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often covered in fine hairs. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in warm climates for its exotic appearance."
