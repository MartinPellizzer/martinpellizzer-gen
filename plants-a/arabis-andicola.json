It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other mustard plants. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are usually basal, lobed, and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in high-altitude regions."
