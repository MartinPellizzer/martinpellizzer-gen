    "intro": "Athyrium cumingianum, commonly known as the Cuming's lady fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Athyrium cumingianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
