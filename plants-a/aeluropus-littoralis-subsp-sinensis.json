It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, often found in tidal flats and coastal dunes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with minute flowers. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal soils and preventing erosion. Its ability to tolerate extreme environmental conditions makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
