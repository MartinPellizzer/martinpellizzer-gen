    "intro": "Athyrium pinnatum, commonly known as the Japanese painted fern, is a fern species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often adorned with a striking silvery-white or cream-colored margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal. The plant reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sori located on the underside of its fronds."
