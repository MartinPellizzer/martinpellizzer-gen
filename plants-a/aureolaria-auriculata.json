    "intro": "Aureolaria auriculata, commonly known as the yellow sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, sandy soils, often found in desert and semi-arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Aureolaria auriculata is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
