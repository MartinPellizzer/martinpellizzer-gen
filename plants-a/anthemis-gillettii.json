The plant produces yellow-orange flower heads composed of numerous small florets, which are typical of the genus Anthemis. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
