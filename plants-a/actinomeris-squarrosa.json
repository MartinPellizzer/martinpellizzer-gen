    "intro": "Actinomeris squarrosa, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which it uses to trap and digest aquatic invertebrates. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches, where it floats on the water surface. Its leaves are often covered in fine, hair-like structures that aid in adhesion to substrates. The plant is adapted to nutrient-poor waters, relying on its prey for essential nutrients.",
