    "intro": "Armatocereus rauhii subsp. rauhii, commonly known as the Rauh's night bloomer, is a columnar cactus native to the Sonoran Desert. It features a tall, cylindrical stem covered in spiny, ribbed segments that help reduce water loss. The plant produces striking, large white flowers at night, which attract nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental beauty and resilience in harsh environments."
