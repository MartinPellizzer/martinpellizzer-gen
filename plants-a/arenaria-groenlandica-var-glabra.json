    "intro": "Arenaria groenlandica var. glabra, commonly known as Greenland sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of small, rounded leaves and produces clusters of tiny white flowers in early summer. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun. Its smooth, glabrous leaves distinguish it from other varieties of Arenaria. This species plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
