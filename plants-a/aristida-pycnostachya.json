    "intro": "Aristida pycnostachya, commonly known as the dense-stalked threeawn, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often adorned with short, bristly hairs. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or arid environments. Due to its resilience and adaptability, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in semi-arid regions."
