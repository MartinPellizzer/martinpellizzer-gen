    "intro": "Artemisia santonica, commonly known as sweet wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-green foliage and small yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant contains volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its medicinal properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its chemical composition, it has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a source of the antimalarial compound artemisinin."
