    "intro": "Astranthium xanthocomoides, commonly known as the yellow-flowered star-thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a basal rosette of spiny, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange star-shaped flowers that bloom in summer. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. Due to its invasive nature, it is often considered a noxious weed in areas outside its native range."
