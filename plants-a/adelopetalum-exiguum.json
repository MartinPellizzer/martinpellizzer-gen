    "intro": "Adelopetalum exiguum, commonly known as the slender bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, helping it to conserve moisture in its arid environment. Its flowering stems are usually unbranched and can reach heights of up to 30 centimeters. Adelopetalum exiguum is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude conditions.",
