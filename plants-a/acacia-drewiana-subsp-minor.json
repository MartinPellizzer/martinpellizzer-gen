    "intro": "Acacia drewiana subsp. minor, commonly known as the dwarf golden wattle, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. It is often found in sandy soils and is a component of the native flora in the region. The subspecies is distinguished from other acacia species by its compact growth habit and smaller size.",

    "taxonomy_art_desc": "Acacia drewiana subsp. minor belongs to the kingdom Plantae. Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises vascular plants with a wide range of morphological diversity, including ferns and some flowering plants. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species and is distinguished by their complex floral structures. Its order is Fabales, which consists of flowering plants that typically have compound leaves and flowers with a distinctive structure. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume family, which includes plants that form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its genus is Acacia, a large group of shrubs and trees known for their distinctive seed pods and often used in various ecological and commercial contexts. Its species is Acacia drewiana, a specific type of acacia that is further divided into subspecies, with subsp. minor being a smaller variant adapted to specific environmental conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia drewiana subsp. minor is primarily native to Western Australia. It is found in the south-western region of the state, particularly in the area around the Fitzgerald River National Park. This subspecies typically grows in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and near-coastal habitats. It is part of the broader Acacia species that are well-adapted to the Mediterranean climate of Western Australia. The plant is known for its distinctive foliage and is a common sight in the local flora of the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia drewiana subsp. minor was mainly introduced to regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure, making it suitable for coastal and semi-arid environments. This subspecies is often used in landscaping due to its attractive foliage and drought tolerance. It has been introduced to parts of California and the Mediterranean Basin as an ornamental plant. However, its invasive potential in some areas requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption."
