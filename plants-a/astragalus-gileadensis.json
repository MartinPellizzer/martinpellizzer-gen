    "intro": "Astragalus gileadensis, commonly known as the Gilead milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish-pink flowers and compound leaves. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that allow it to access water from underground sources. Astragalus gileadensis is often found in rocky soils and is a component of the vegetation in arid and semi-arid ecosystems. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
