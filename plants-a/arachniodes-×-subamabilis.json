    "intro": "Arachniodes \u00d7 subamabilis, commonly known as the Shaggy Ink Cap, is a species of fungus that belongs to the family Tricholomataceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shaggy, dark brown cap that resembles ink stains, hence its common name. The gill structure is typically pale to yellowish, and the stem is often covered with a fine, fibrous layer. This mushroom is typically found in temperate regions, growing in association with various tree species in forested areas. It is generally considered edible but is not commonly consumed due to its mild flavor and less appealing texture."
