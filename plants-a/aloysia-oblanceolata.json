    "intro": "Aloysia oblanceolata, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Aloysia oblanceolata is also valued for its use in herbal medicine and as an ornamental plant."
