It features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
