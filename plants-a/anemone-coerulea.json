    "intro": "Anemone coerulea, commonly known as the blue anemone, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a soft, velvety texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its delicate appearance and early blooming habit make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
