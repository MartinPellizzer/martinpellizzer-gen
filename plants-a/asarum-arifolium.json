    "intro": "Asarum arifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved wild ginger, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, reddish-brown flowers that are clustered in a spicate inflorescence, typically blooming in late spring. Its rhizomatous root system is thick and fleshy, which helps it survive in shaded, moist environments. Asarum arifolium is valued in traditional medicine for its aromatic properties and is often used in herbal remedies."
