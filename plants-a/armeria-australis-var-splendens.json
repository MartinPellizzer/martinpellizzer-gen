    "intro": "Armeria australis var. splendens, commonly known as the showy sandspurr, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and clusters of bright pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant features silver-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, enhancing its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its hardiness and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and native gardens."
