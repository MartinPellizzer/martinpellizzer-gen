    "intro": "Aporosa dendroidea, commonly known as the climbing aporosa, is a woody vine native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its twining stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are follicles that contain several seeds, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
