    "intro": "Actinidia melanandra var. cretacea, commonly known as the Cretaceous actinidia, is a rare and ancient species of vine native to China. It belongs to the Actinidiaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by edible berries, although these are not as widely cultivated as other actinidia species. Due to its historical significance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.",
