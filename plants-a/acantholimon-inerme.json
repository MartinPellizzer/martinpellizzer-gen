    "intro": "Acantholimon inerme, commonly known as the smooth thornsteppe, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants adapted to harsh environments. The plant features dense, wiry stems covered with small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters and blooming in late spring to early summer. Acantholimon inerme is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush-steppe habitats.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon inerme is primarily native to Afghanistan. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions of the country. This plant thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often growing in mountainous areas. It is well adapted to the harsh climate and low precipitation typical of its native habitat. Acantholimon inerme plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon inerme was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, gravelly slopes, and disturbed agricultural land. It is commonly found in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen in coastal and inland areas. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions outside its native range. It is considered a potential invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new environments."
