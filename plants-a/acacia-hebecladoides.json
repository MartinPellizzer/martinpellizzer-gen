    "intro": "Acacia hebecladoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted stems and small, bipinnate leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance and resistance to salt spray. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping in coastal and dry regions.",

It is commonly found in the coastal and interior areas of the Geraldton and Shark Bay regions. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with open woodlands and shrublands. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native habitat. Due to its unique ecological role, it is an important component of the local flora in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia hebecladoides was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It is a shrub that thrives in coastal and lowland areas. This plant has been used for erosion control due to its hardy nature. However, it can become invasive in certain environments. Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native plant communities."
