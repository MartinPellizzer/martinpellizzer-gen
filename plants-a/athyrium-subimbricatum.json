    "intro": "Athyrium subimbricatum, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are divided into overlapping segments, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Athyrium subimbricatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various garden conditions."
