    "intro": "Agave expatriata, commonly known as the Mexican hat agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick, fleshy, and covered in a blue-gray hue with white teeth along the edges. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid climates. Agave expatriata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional practices."
