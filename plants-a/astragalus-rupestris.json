    "intro": "Astragalus rupestris, commonly known as the rock milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats, with small, hairy stems and yellow or pale green flowers. The plant thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments. Its small, compound leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Astragalus rupestris plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
