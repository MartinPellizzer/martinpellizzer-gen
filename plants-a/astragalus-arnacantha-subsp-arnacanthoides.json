    "intro": "Astragalus arnacantha subsp. arnacanthoides, commonly known as the Sierra foothill milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and open woodlands. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces yellow to reddish flowers in late spring. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a deep taproot system that helps it survive in arid conditions. This subspecies is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
