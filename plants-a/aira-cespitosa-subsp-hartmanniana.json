    "intro": "Aira cespitosa subsp. hartmanniana, commonly known as Hartmann's tufted grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form compact clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy or gravelly soils."
