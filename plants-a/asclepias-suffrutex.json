    "intro": "Asclepias suffrutex, commonly known as the green milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features upright, branching stems covered in soft, hairy foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milky sap contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many animals but essential for the survival of monarch butterflies. Asclepias suffrutex plays a vital role in supporting pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its habitat."
