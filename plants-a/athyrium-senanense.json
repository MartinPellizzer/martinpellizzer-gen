    "intro": "Athyrium senanense, commonly known as the Philippine male fern, is a species of flowering plant in the family Athyriaceae. It is native to the Philippines and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories, and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Its reproductive structures are inconspicuous, with small, greenish spore-bearing clusters on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
