    "intro": "Adenotrias phrygia, commonly known as the Phrygian adenotris, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces a distinctive scent that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Adenotrias phrygia is considered endangered in many parts of its range.",
