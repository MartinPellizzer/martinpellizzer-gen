    "intro": "Anthoxanthum odoratum var. villosissimum, commonly known as sweet vernalgrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and bright yellow to golden inflorescences that appear in early spring. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, soft texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its aromatic scent and early blooming period make it an important early-season nectar source for pollinators."
