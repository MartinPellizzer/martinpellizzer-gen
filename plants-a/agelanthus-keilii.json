    "intro": "Agelanthus keilii, commonly known as the Keil's agelanthus, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to red. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in areas with high altitude and cool temperatures. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a rough texture that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, Agelanthus keilii is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
