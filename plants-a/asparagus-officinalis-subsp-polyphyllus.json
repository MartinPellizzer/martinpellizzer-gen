    "intro": "Asparagus officinalis subsp. polyphyllus, commonly known as the giant asparagus or silver asparagus, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its large, fern-like, bipinnate leaves that are often silvery-white underneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by edible, tender spears that emerge from the soil in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental and edible gardening. Its botanical features make it a unique addition to both landscape design and culinary use."
