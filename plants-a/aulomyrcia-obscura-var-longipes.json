    "intro": "Aulomyrcia obscura var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the understory of tropical rainforests. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters, with a distinctive, pale green hue. The plant thrives in high humidity and shade, often growing on mossy substrates or in rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, which are typically concealed by a protective indusium. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
