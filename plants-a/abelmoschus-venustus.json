    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelmoschus venustus is primarily native to southern Asia, including countries such as India, Nepal, and Bhutan. It is commonly found in regions with tropical and subtropical climates. This plant typically grows in open fields, along roadsides, and in disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Indonesia. Abelmoschus venustus is often associated with warm, humid environments and is adapted to thrive in such conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus venustus was mainly introduced to South America through human activity, particularly during the 19th and 20th centuries. It was brought for its ornamental value due to its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant has since become naturalized in several regions, including parts of Brazil and Argentina. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Despite its introduction, it has not become invasive and is primarily cultivated for its aesthetic appeal."
