    "intro": "Aechmea servitensis var. exigua, commonly known as the miniature bromeliad, is a compact, epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking, short-lived inflorescences with brightly colored flowers, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil with high humidity. Due to its small size and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
