    "intro": "Angelica sachalinensis f. saninensis, commonly known as the Sakhalin angelica, is a rare and unique botanical variant native to the Russian Far East. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, forested areas and is known for its tall, slender stems and large, compound leaves. It produces small white to greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, which attract various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range."
