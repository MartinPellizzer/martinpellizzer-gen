    "intro": "Arabis multiceps, commonly known as the clustered rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Arabis multiceps is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
