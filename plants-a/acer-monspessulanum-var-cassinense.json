    "intro": "Acer monspessulanum var. cassinense, commonly known as the Catalan maple, is a rare and ornamental variant of the maple tree. It is native to the Iberian Peninsula and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant red in autumn. It produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialty collections.",
