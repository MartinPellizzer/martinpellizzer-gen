    "intro": "Amylotheca subumbellata, commonly known as the umbrella liverwort, is a small, mat-forming liverwort found in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Pinnatifidaceae and is characterized by its intricate, branching thallus with a distinctive umbrella-like arrangement of leaf-like structures. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a simple, flat, green body called a thallus. It reproduces via spores, which are produced in capsule-like structures on the tips of its branches. Amylotheca subumbellata is often used in ecological studies to indicate the health of wetland habitats."
