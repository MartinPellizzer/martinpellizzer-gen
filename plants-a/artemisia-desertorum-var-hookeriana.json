    "intro": "Artemisia desertorum var. hookeriana, commonly known as Hooker's sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-green foliage and small, yellowish-gray flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, semi-desert environments. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. Hooker's sage also has a long history of traditional use by Indigenous peoples for medicinal and ceremonial purposes."
