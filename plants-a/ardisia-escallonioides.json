    "intro": "Ardisia escallonioides, commonly known as the Escallonia-like ardisia, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers followed by bright red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and vibrant fruiting display."
