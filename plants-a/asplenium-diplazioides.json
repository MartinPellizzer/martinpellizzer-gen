    "intro": "Asplenium diplazioides, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are released in small, clustered structures called sorus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. Asplenium diplazioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant."
