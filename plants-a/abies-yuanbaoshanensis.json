    "intro": "Abies yuanbaoshanensis, commonly known as the Yuanbaoshan fir, is a rare conifer native to China. It is characterized by its conical shape and needle-like leaves that are dark green and slightly curved. The tree produces cones that are typically reddish-brown and contain seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species.",
