    "intro": "Arabis missouriensis, commonly known as Missouri rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the central United States. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 5 to 15 centimeters. The plant features basal leaves that are pinnately lobed and small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
