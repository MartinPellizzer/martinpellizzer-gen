    "intro": "Azara emiliae, commonly known as the Brazilian mahogany or emilia's azara, is a small evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Azara emiliae is valued for its durable, aromatic wood, which has been traditionally used in furniture and carving. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species."
