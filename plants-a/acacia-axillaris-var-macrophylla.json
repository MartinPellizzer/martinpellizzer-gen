    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia axillaris var. macrophylla is primarily native to the eastern and southern regions of Australia, including the states of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands, grasslands, and rocky outcrops. This variety is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in well-drained soils. It is a shrub or small tree that plays an important role in local ecosystems. Its distribution is closely associated with areas that have a Mediterranean climate with hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia axillaris var. macrophylla was mainly introduced to regions with warm, dry climates and well-drained soils, often found in coastal areas and rocky outcrops. It is commonly used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and attractive, feathery foliage. This variety is particularly suited for areas with low rainfall and high sunlight exposure. It has been introduced to several parts of Australia, including New South Wales and Queensland, where it thrives in both urban and rural settings. However, its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain environments."
