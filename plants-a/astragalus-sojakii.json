    "intro": "Astragalus sojakii, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and small, yellow to cream-colored flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces pods that contain several small, rounded seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus sojakii is adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments, often growing on rocky soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
