    "intro": "Acalypha sabulicola, commonly known as sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. It is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Its botanical features make it a hardy and resilient species suitable for xeriscaping.",

This plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils. It is commonly found in desert scrub and coastal dunes. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within the southwestern part of Mexico.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha sabulicola was mainly introduced to disturbed soils and coastal areas along the southeastern United States. It thrives in sandy or gravelly habitats, often found in dunes, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant spreads through seeds dispersed by wind, water, and animals, contributing to its rapid colonization of new sites. Its ability to tolerate salt and drought makes it a common invasive species in coastal regions. However, it is considered a non-native plant in these areas, often outcompeting native vegetation."
