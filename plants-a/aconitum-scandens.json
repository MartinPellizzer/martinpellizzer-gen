    "intro": "Aconitum scandens, commonly known as the climbing aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a robust rhizome system and produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports or other vegetation. Its leaves are typically deeply lobed and can be quite large, contributing to its ornamental appeal. However, all parts of the plant contain potent toxins, making it highly dangerous to handle or ingest.",
