    "intro": "Allium glaucum, commonly known as the blue onion or wild leek, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It features a basal rosette of broad, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, spherical, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in a dense cluster at the end of each stem. Its bulbous stem base is often used in culinary applications, similar to other allium species. Botanically, it belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is valued for its ornamental and edible qualities."
