It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is commonly used as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative propagation. It has been introduced to several countries in the Americas, including parts of the United States, Mexico, and Central America. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not properly managed."
