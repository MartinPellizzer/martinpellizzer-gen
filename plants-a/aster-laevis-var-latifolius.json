    "intro": "Aster laevis var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf aster, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that typically bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant features upright stems covered with fine hairs and lance-shaped leaves that are broader than those of the typical Aster laevis. It prefers full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a suitable addition to native gardens. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
