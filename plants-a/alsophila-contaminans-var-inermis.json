    "intro": "Alsophila contaminans var. inermis, commonly known as the slender tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its fronds are usually dark green and can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. This variety is distinguished by its lack of spines on the frond tips, giving it a smooth appearance."
