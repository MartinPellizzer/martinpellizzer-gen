    "intro": "Arabis umbrosa var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It typically features basal leaves that are smooth and glossy, with a rosette-like structure. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
