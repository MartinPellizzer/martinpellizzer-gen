    "intro": "Adiantum arborescens, commonly known as the tree fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of delicate, bi-lobed fronds that resemble a tree. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its fronds are pinnately divided and can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. Adiantum arborescens reproduces via spores, which are released from sporangia located on the underside of its fronds.",
