    "intro": "Alsinastrum orthospermum, commonly known as desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, thriving in hot and dry environments. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The species is well adapted to desert conditions, making it an important part of the local flora in its native habitat."
