It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, white, five-petaled flowers. The plant has a compact rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. The flowers bloom in spring and are pollinated by insects, making it an attractive plant for gardens and natural habitats."
