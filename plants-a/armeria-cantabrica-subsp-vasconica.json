    "intro": "Armeria cantabrica subsp. vasconica, commonly known as the Cantabrian thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of northern Spain. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage with soft, woolly textures, which help it retain moisture in its arid, coastal habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to maritime gardens."
