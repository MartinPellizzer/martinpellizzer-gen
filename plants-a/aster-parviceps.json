    "intro": "Aster parviceps, commonly known as the small-headed aster, is a flowering plant native to the northeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads made up of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. Its flowers are usually blue to purple in color, with ray florets that are shorter than those of many other aster species. Aster parviceps is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
