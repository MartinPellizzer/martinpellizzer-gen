It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its fibrous root system makes it a valuable plant for erosion control and forage production."
