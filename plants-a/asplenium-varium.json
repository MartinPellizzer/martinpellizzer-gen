    "intro": "Asplenium varium, commonly known as the variable spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in shaded, moist environments. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows on rocks, trees, or soil in temperate regions, and its rhizomes help anchor it to substrates. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are clustered on the underside of its fronds. Asplenium varium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its unique foliage."
