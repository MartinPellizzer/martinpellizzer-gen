    "intro": "Astragalus angustiflorus subsp. anatolicus, commonly known as the Anatolian narrow-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to southeastern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils, often in open woodlands or grasslands. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and floral display."
