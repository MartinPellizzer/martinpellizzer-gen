    "intro": "Astragalus triphyllus, commonly known as the three-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria. Astragalus triphyllus is often found in open grasslands and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
