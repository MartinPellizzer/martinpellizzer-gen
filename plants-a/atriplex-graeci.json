    "intro": "Atriplex graeci, commonly known as Greek saltbush, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its succulent leaves and small, greenish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant is adapted to arid and saline environments, making it highly resilient to drought and salt stress. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Atriplex graeci is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in challenging conditions."
