    "intro": "Arenaria aggregata var. epitricha, commonly known as the hairy sand-flower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and coastal regions. It is characterized by its compact rosette of hairy, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky habitats. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective pioneer species in stabilizing loose, unstable soils."
