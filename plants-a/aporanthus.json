    "intro": "Aporanthus, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, dandelion-like flowers that are typically yellow and arranged in a composite head. Aporanthus species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with moist, shaded habitats. They have alternate, heart-shaped leaves and produce seeds that are dispersed by wind. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine."
