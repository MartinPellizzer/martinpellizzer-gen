    "intro": "Astragalus sesquiflorus var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow flowers in late spring. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. This variety is noted for its compact growth habit and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems."
