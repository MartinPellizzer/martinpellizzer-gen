    "intro": "Acalypha lagoensis var. grandifolia, commonly known as the giant swampmallow, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of Africa. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, adding visual interest to its appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shady environments, often found near streams or in swampy areas. Its rapid growth and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for wetland gardens and ecological restoration projects.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha lagoensis var. grandifolia is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich soil and ample sunlight. This variant is commonly found in forest understories and along riverbanks in its native range. It is also occasionally reported in parts of the Pacific Islands. The plant is well adapted to the warm, moist climate of its natural habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha lagoensis var. grandifolia was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly in South Africa and Namibia. It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found along dunes and near the shoreline. This plant is known for its attractive, large, heart-shaped leaves and is often used in ornamental gardening. It has been reported to spread rapidly in disturbed coastal habitats. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native vegetation in these areas."
