    "intro": "Aeluropus pungens var. hirtulus, commonly known as hairy marsh grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and wiry, hairy stems that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing minute florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it an important component of coastal and desert ecosystems. Its fibrous roots contribute to soil stabilization and erosion control in harsh environments."
