    "intro": "Alnus \u00d7 beckii var. ambigua, commonly known as the hybrid alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a hybrid between Alnus virginiana and Alnus incana, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and oval-shaped, with a rough texture and serrated edges. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind."
