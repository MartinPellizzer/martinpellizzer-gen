    "intro": "Anagallis linifolia f. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular-flowered mouse-ear, is a variant of the mouse-ear creeper. It is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe, characterized by its prostrate growth habit and hairy stems. The leaves are typically linear to lanceolate, with a distinctive glandular surface that gives the plant its specific epithet. It produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or red, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. This cultivar is often cultivated for its ornamental value in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and attractive foliage."
