    "intro": "Androcalva rosea, commonly known as the pink-flowered orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are typically elongated and covered in a fine, waxy coating to reduce water loss. Androcalva rosea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
