    "intro": "Acacia \u00d7 semiaurea, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a hybrid shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow floral spikes, which are borne along the stems and are highly attractive to pollinators. The plant has bipinnate leaves that are feathery in appearance and often have a pale golden hue. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Acacia \u00d7 semiaurea is also valued for its hardiness and ability to withstand drought conditions.",

It is a hybrid species that occurs naturally in the region, often found in arid and semi-arid environments. This plant is commonly seen in coastal and inland areas where the climate supports its growth. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of the Australian landscape. Its native distribution is closely linked to the unique ecological conditions of South Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia \u00d7 semiaurea was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its attractive golden foliage and drought tolerance. It is commonly cultivated in regions with warm climates, such as parts of the Mediterranean, southern California, and Australia. This hybrid plant is often used in gardens and public spaces for its aesthetic value and low maintenance requirements. However, it has also been reported to spread beyond cultivated areas, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. Its distribution is largely restricted to areas where it is intentionally planted, though it may establish itself in disturbed soils."
