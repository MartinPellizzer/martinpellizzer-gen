    "intro": "Avenula peloponnesiaca, commonly known as the Peloponnesian oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in dry, sunny habitats. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet cluster, bearing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Avenula peloponnesiaca is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
