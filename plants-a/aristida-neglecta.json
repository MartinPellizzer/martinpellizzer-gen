It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, fluffy seeds that are easily dispersed by the wind. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and compact growth habit, making it well adapted to dry environments. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
