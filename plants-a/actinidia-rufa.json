    "intro": "Actinidia rufa, commonly known as the red actinidia, is a deciduous vine native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves that turn a striking red or orange color in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that give way to edible, fuzzy berries. These berries are often consumed by birds and can be used in jams and wines. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.",
