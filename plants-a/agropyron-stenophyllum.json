    "intro": "Agropyron stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrowleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or arid soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is well adapted to harsh environments, tolerating drought and poor soil conditions. Agropyron stenophyllum is valued for its erosion control capabilities and as a forage plant for livestock."
