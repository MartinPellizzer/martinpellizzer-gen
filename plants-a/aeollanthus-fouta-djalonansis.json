    "intro": "Aeollanthus fouta-djalonansis, commonly known as the Fouta Djalon endemic, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of West Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowering period occurs during the dry season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
