    "intro": "Androsace glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular androsace, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically produces white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are covered in glandular hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance and aid in moisture retention. Androsace glandulosa is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments."
