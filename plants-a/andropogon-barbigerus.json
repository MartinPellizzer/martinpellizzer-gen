    "intro": "Andropogon barbigerus, commonly known as the hairy bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture on the underside. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairies and open woodlands. Andropogon barbigerus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
