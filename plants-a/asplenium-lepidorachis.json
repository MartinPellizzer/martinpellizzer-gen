    "intro": "Asplenium lepidorachis, commonly known as the silver-veined spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices or on tree trunks. Its rhizomes are short and clustered, allowing it to form dense mats. Asplenium lepidorachis is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and hardy nature."
