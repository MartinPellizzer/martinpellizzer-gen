    "intro": "Acalypha macularis, commonly known as the spotted spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy bracts that often display shades of red, orange, or yellow, which are not petals but modified leaves. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture and often features a distinctive red or purple spot on the underside. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Acalypha macularis is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha macularis is primarily native to Brazil Northeast and Brazil Southeast. This plant is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these areas. It thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils. The species is often seen in forest understories and along riverbanks. Its native range highlights its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of northeastern and southeastern Brazil.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha macularis was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was likely brought there during the 19th or early 20th century by horticulturalists and gardeners seeking exotic plants for landscaping. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative reproduction contribute to its success in new environments. Efforts to control its spread have been challenging due to its adaptability and resilience."
