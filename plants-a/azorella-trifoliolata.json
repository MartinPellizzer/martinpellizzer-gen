    "intro": "Azorella trifoliolata, commonly known as the Chilean cushion plant, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that forms dense cushions of foliage, which help it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant has small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a thick layer of fine, white hairs, providing insulation against cold and wind. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, typically appearing in late summer. Azorella trifoliolata is well adapted to rocky, nutrient-poor soils and plays an important ecological role in its alpine habitat."
