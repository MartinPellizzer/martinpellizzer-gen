    "intro": "Astragalus leptus var. bamianicus, commonly known as the Bamian Mountain milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, kidney-shaped pods containing several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
