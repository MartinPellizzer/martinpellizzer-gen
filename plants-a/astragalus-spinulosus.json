    "intro": "Astragalus spinulosus, commonly known as the spiny milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry environments. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus spinulosus is often found in open habitats such as grasslands, shrublands, and along streambanks."
