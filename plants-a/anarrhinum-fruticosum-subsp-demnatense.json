    "intro": "Anarrhinum fruticosum subsp. demnatense, commonly known as the Moroccan tamarisk, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and produces small, greenish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high salinity and low water availability. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitat."
