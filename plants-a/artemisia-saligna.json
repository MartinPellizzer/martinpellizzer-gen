    "intro": "Artemisia saligna, commonly known as silver sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish flower heads that are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. Artemisia saligna is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in dry conditions. It is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems and is an important component of the local flora."
