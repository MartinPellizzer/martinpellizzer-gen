It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils at high elevations. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a compact growth habit. Andriapetalum sprucei is adapted to harsh alpine environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
