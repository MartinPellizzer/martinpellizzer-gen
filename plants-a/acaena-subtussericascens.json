    "intro": "Acaena subtussericascens, commonly known as the New Zealand thornless burrush, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and clustered, spiny fruits. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a serrated edge. Acaena subtussericascens is typically found in coastal and damp habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native environment.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena subtussericascens is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the eastern and western regions. This plant typically grows in forest margins, shrublands, and along streambanks. It is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. The species is part of the bramble family and is known for its prickly stems and small, yellowish flowers.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena subtussericascens was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of the Acaena genus, which includes several species with ornamental and ecological value. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the South Island. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including disturbed soils and open areas. However, its invasive potential remains a topic of ongoing ecological study."
