    "intro": "Acrostichum umbrosum, commonly known as the dark fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often densely packed. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in low light conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. The fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive, almost zigzag appearance along their margins.",
