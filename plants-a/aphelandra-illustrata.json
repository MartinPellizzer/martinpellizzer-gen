    "intro": "Aphelandra illustrata, commonly known as the golden flame plant, is a tropical species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, yellow, and white. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Aphelandra illustrata is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
