    "intro": "Androsace dieckeana, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit with small, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early summer, which are typically borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in alpine gardens."
