    "intro": "Asarum carolinianum, commonly known as Carolina wild ginger, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped, reddish-brown leaves with a distinctive ginger-like aroma when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in a spathaceous structure. It thrives in shady, moist woodland environments and is often found in rich, loamy soils. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies."
