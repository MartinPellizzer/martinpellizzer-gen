    "intro": "Annona cuneata var. longepetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled soursop, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with long petioles, which distinguish it from other annona species. The plant produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically borne in clusters. Its fruit is a large, spiny berry with a sweet, aromatic pulp, though it is less commonly cultivated than other annona varieties. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties."
