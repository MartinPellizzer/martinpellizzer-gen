    "intro": "Aspidium macrourum, commonly known as the long-veined water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are typically bipinnate, with a finely divided structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to substrates such as soil or rocks. Aspidium macrourum plays a role in maintaining ecological balance by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling in its native habitats."
