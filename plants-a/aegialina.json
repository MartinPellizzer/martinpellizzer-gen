    "intro": "Aegialina, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the Malvaceae family. These plants are typically found in coastal areas, where they thrive in saline and sandy soils. Aegialina species are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are usually palmately lobed, and the stems are often succulent, helping the plant retain moisture in arid environments. They play an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
