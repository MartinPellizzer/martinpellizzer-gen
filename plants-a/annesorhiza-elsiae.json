    "intro": "Annesorhiza elsiae, commonly known as the Elsie's beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of pink to purple tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Annesorhiza elsiae is a perennial herb that blooms in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
