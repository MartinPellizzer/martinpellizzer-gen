    "intro": "Aphanopleura breviseta, commonly known as the short-hairless bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its simple, branched stems and small, bladder-like structures that trap tiny aquatic organisms. This plant is typically found in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. It lacks true leaves and instead has specialized structures called bladders for capturing prey. The plant is often used in ecological studies due to its role in aquatic food webs."
