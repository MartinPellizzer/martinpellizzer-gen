    "intro": "Antidesma samarense, commonly known as the Samaran starfruit, is a small evergreen shrub native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries that are edible. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
