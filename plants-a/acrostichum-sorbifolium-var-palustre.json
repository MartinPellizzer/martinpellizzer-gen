    "intro": "Acrostichum sorbifolium var. palustre, commonly known as the swamp fern, is a variant of the sorbifolium fern that thrives in wetland environments. It is characterized by its broad, serrated leaves that can grow up to 30 inches in length. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, forming a thick mat that helps stabilize soil in marshy areas. It prefers full sun to partial shade and is often found in freshwater wetlands. Its ability to tolerate waterlogged soils makes it an important component of riparian and swamp ecosystems.",
