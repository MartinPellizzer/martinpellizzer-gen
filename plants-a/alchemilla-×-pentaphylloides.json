    "intro": "Alchemilla \u00d7 pentaphylloides, commonly known as the five-leafed lady's mantle, is a hybrid perennial plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosette of dark green, velvety leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and long blooming period."
