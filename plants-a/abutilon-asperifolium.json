    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon asperifolium is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is commonly found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Texas. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is often seen in desert landscapes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in similar climates.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon asperifolium was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in disturbed areas. It is commonly found in disturbed soils along roadsides, railroads, and construction sites. This plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. It has become a common weed in many regions where it has been introduced. However, its invasive potential varies depending on environmental conditions and management practices."
