    "intro": "Asclepias peltigera, commonly known as the peltate milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that attract various pollinators, including butterflies and bees. Its latex sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Asclepias peltigera plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae."
