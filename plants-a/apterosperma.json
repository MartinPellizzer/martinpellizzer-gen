    "intro": "Apterosperma, commonly known as the naked-seed plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its lack of bracts and the presence of small, scale-like leaves. The flowers are typically small and clustered in umbels, and the fruits are dry, three-lobed schizocarps. The genus is native to regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa. Apterosperma species are often found in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to arid environments."
