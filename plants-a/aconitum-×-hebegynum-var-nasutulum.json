    "intro": "Aconitum \u00d7 hebegynum var. nasutulum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved aconite, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features palmately lobed leaves with a coarse texture, and its stems are typically hairy and robust. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets.",
