It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in rocky and coastal environments, often found on dry, sunny slopes. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the harsh, maritime climate of its native habitat."
