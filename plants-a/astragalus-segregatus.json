    "intro": "Astragalus segregatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is found in regions such as the western United States and parts of Canada. Its leaves are compound, with several pairs of narrow, linear leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus segregatus plays a role in stabilizing soils and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
