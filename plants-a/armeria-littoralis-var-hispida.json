    "intro": "Armeria littoralis var. hispida, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and western Europe. It features dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and coastal winds. This variety is often used in coastal landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
