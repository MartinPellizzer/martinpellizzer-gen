    "intro": "Aster linearifolius, commonly known as the linear-leaf aster, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white to purple, typically blooming from late summer into early fall. It thrives in moist to wet soils in full sun to partial shade, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
