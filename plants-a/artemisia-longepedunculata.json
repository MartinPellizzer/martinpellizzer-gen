    "intro": "Artemisia longepedunculata, commonly known as long-pedunculate wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and slender, branching stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late summer, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used in traditional medicine for its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory effects."
