    "intro": "Actaea arguta var. alabastrina, commonly known as the white-fringed bugbane, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features striking, compound, white to pale green leaves with prominent, fringed margins that give it its common name. The plant produces upright, spikelike clusters of small, white flowers in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady woodland habitats and is often found in rich, loamy soils. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects.",
