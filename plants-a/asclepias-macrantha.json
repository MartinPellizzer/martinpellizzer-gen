    "intro": "Asclepias macrantha, commonly known as showy milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of large, showy pink to reddish-purple flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals. Its leaves are opposite, oval, and have a slightly hairy texture. Asclepias macrantha is an important host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and plays a key role in supporting pollinator biodiversity."
