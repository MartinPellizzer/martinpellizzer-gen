    "intro": "Allium chlorurum, commonly known as the yellow onion, is a bulbous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its strong, pungent odor and flavor. The plant produces clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves and develops a bulb that is the primary edible part. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, forming in umbels at the top of the stem. Allium chlorurum is widely cultivated for culinary use and has been historically valued for its medicinal properties."
