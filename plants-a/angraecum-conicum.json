    "intro": "Angraecum conicum, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a unique epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it a distinctive and elegant appearance. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Angraecum conicum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
