    "intro": "Adenospermum, commonly known as the silverleaf vine, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The flowers are typically showy, with five lobes and a prominent corona, and they are usually yellow or orange in color. The fruit is a follicle that contains several seeds, and the plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. Adenospermum species are often used in traditional medicine and can be toxic due to the presence of cardiac glycosides."
