    "intro": "Abies firma, commonly known as the white fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, pyramid-shaped crown and silver-blue needles that are shorter than those of other fir species. The cones of Abies firma are typically conic and pendulous, with prickly bracts, and they mature to a reddish-brown color. This species thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests. Its wood is valued for its strength and fine grain, making it useful in construction and furniture-making.",
