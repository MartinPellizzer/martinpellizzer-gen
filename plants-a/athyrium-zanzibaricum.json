    "intro": "Athyrium zanzibaricum, commonly known as the Zanzibar fern, is a species of polypody fern native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into numerous narrow segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The leaves are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking ornamental plant in tropical gardens."
