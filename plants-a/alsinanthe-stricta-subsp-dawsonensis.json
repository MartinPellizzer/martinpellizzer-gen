    "intro": "Alsinanthe stricta subsp. dawsonensis, commonly known as Dawson's alsine, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of North America. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and wetlands. It is a low-growing perennial that produces numerous tiny, greenish-yellow flowers throughout the summer months. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native range."
