    "intro": "Arenaria serpyllifolia var. patula, commonly known as silver sandplant, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to sandy and coastal environments. It features small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for erosion control and ornamental planting."
