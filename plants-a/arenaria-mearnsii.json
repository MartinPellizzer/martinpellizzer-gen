    "intro": "Arenaria mearnsii, commonly known as the Mearns' sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are generally succulent and adapted to arid conditions, which helps it conserve water. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
