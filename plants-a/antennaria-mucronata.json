    "intro": "Antennaria mucronata, commonly known as the bentleaf mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves that are often bent or curled, giving it its common name. The plant produces tiny white flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Antennaria mucronata plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine and tundra environments."
