    "intro": "Aulomyrcia comosa, commonly known as the silky sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its slender, branching form and leathery, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing a single seed. Its bark is thick and fissured, often exuding a resinous sap that has been used traditionally by Indigenous communities. Aulomyrcia comosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
