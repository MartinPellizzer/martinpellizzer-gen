    "intro": "Astragalus mucronifolius var. brevidentatus, commonly known as the short-toothed milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions. The plant features slender, erect stems with alternate, pinnately compound leaves that have short, rounded lobes. Its small, yellowish-pink flowers are clustered in loose spikes, and it produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and supporting pollinators in its native habitat."
