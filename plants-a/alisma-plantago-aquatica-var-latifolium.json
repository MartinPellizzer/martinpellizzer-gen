    "intro": "Alisma plantago-aquatica var. latifolium, commonly known as broadleaf water plantain, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features long, narrow leaves that are typically broad at the base, floating on the water surface or emerging from the water. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in early summer. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize the soil in aquatic environments. This variety is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to filter water and provide habitat for aquatic life."
