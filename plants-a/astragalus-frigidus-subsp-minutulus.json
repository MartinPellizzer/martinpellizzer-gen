    "intro": "Astragalus frigidus subsp. minutulus, commonly known as the dwarf frost pea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in cold, dry environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and possesses the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
