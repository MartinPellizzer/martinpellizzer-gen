    "intro": "Albuca viscosella, commonly known as the sticky albuca, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a short, rhizomatous stem and produces clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is notable for its sticky, gelatinous sap, which is a distinctive botanical characteristic. It blooms with yellow, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Albuca viscosella is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
