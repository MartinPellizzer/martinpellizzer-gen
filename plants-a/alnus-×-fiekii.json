    "intro": "Alnus \u00d7 fiekii, commonly known as the hybrid alder, is a deciduous tree resulting from the cross between Alnus incana (grey alder) and Alnus glutinosa (black alder). It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves and catkin-like flowers, which are typical of the alder genus. The tree produces small, woody fruits that disperse via wind, aiding in its propagation. Alnus \u00d7 fiekii is often found in wet or moist soils, thriving in riparian zones and other waterlogged areas. Its ecological importance includes nitrogen fixation, which enriches the soil and supports surrounding vegetation."
