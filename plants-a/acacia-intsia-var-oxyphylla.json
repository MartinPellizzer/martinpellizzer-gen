    "intro": "Acacia intsia var. oxyphylla, commonly known as the white acacia, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and long, flat, pale green phyllodes that resemble leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular inflorescences, which bloom during the dry season. Its bark is smooth and grayish, often exuding a milky sap when damaged.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia intsia var. oxyphylla is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland and hill forests. This species thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is often associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats. Its distribution extends to parts of northern Australia as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia intsia var. oxyphylla was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential use in agroforestry. It is commonly found in countries such as India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, humid climate. Its introduction has been associated with both ecological benefits and challenges due to its invasive tendencies in some areas. It is often planted for its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
