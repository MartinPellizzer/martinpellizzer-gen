    "intro": "Asclepias oenotheroides, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. Asclepias oenotheroides plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and a host plant for their larvae."
