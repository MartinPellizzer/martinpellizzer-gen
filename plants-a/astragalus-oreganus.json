    "intro": "Astragalus oreganus, commonly known as mountain milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and meadows. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus oreganus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing food for native wildlife."
