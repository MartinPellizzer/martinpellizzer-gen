    "intro": "Allosorus subvillosus, commonly known as the woolly alpine lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in cool, moist environments. It is characterized by its dense, woolly appearance, which helps it retain moisture in harsh alpine conditions. The thallus is typically pale green to yellowish in color, with a slightly leathery texture. It forms symbiotic relationships with algae and fungi, contributing to its ability to survive in nutrient-poor substrates. This lichen is often found on rocks and tree trunks in mountainous regions."
