    "intro": "Astragalus gregarius, commonly known as the clustered milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as grasslands, roadsides, and sandy soils. The plant features compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets and produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers in racemate clusters. Its fruit is a legume pod that contains several small, kidney-shaped seeds. Astragalus gregarius is adapted to dry conditions and has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor environments."
