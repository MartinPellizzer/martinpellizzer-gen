It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a single, showy flower head that resembles a dandelion. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and is native to regions of southern Africa. Anthosiphon species are herbaceous perennials that produce small, yellow flowers followed by fluffy, white seed heads. These plants are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their distinctive appearance and ease of care."
