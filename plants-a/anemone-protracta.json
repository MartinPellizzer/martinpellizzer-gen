    "intro": "Anemone protracta, commonly known as the showy anemone, is a perennial flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, white to pinkish flowers with five to nine petals. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has palmate, lobed leaves that are hairy beneath. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and it is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value. Anemone protracta is also a host plant for certain butterfly species, contributing to local biodiversity."
