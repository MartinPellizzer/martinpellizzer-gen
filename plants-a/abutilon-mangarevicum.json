    "intro": "Abutilon mangarevicum, commonly known as the mangareva fanflower, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, particularly the islands of Mangareva and Pitcairn. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and salt spray. Abutilon mangarevicum is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in subtropical gardens.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon mangarevicum is primarily native to the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii, Tonga, and Samoa. It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity. It is often associated with rocky or sandy soils in its natural habitat. Its distribution is limited to specific regions within the Pacific Ocean.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon mangarevicum was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive fuzzy leaves and showy flowers. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. It is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. However, it is not considered invasive and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems."
