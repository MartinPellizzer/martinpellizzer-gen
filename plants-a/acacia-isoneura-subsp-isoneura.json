    "intro": "Acacia isoneura subsp. isoneura, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads, which are typical of the Acacia genus. It is well adapted to dry environments, with a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater. This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates.",

It is found in the southern and western regions of the state, particularly in the areas of the Geraldton and Shark Bay regions. This subspecies thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy soils. It is commonly found in coastal and inland dunes, as well as in open woodlands. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia isoneura subsp. isoneura was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly used for land rehabilitation and afforestation projects due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This subspecies is also valued for its potential in providing firewood and livestock forage. Its introduction has been documented in several countries across Africa and the Middle East. However, its spread has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems."
