It is native to the wetlands and marshes of the Americas, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. The plants typically have broad, sword-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional medicine.

These plants play an important role in their ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
