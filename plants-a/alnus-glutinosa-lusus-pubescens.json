    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa lusus pubescens, commonly known as the sticky alder, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, often sticky bark and its alternate, simple, ovate leaves that are usually pubescent. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in riparian zones or wetlands. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration projects."
