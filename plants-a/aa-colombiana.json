The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, typically in cloud forests. It is an important species in the local ecosystem. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Aa colombiana was mainly introduced to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in Colombia and Ecuador. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. This plant is commonly found in cloud forests and along riverbanks. Its introduction has been largely due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties. However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native flora."
