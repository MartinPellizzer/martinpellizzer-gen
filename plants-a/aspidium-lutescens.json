    "intro": "Aspidium lutescens, commonly known as the yellow holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its fronds that are typically bright yellow to golden in color, especially when young. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia. Aspidium lutescens thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
