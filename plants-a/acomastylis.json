    "intro": "Acomastylis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and yellow composite flowers. Acomastylis species are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, where they thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. They have a short flowering period, usually in spring, and rely on insect pollination. The genus is notable for its ecological adaptability and role in supporting local wildlife."
