    "intro": "Aegilops speltoides, commonly known as false wheat, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that bear small, two-lobed florets, which are typically green or pale in color. It is a perennial species that thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Aegilops speltoides is of interest to researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement."
