    "intro": "Alchemilla sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla sessiliflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
