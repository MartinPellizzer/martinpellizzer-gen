    "intro": "Aspalathus serpens, commonly known as the snake's head or snake plant, is a member of the Fabaceae family. It is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a silvery underside. It produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Aspalathus serpens is well adapted to arid conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
