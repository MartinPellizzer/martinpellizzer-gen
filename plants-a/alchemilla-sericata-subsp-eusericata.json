It features dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are covered in a fine, silvery down, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
