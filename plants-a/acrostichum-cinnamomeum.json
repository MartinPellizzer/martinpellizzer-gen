    "intro": "Acrostichum cinnamomeum, commonly known as cinnamon fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, arching fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in height, with a distinctive cinnamon-colored fiddlehead at the base. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. The cinnamon fern is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest floors where it thrives in high humidity and partial shade.",
