    "intro": "Anthocercis littorea, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is known for its aromatic properties. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory effects. Anthocercis littorea typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines, where it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
