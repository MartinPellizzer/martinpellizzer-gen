It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in well-drained soils make it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in stabilizing sandy soils."
