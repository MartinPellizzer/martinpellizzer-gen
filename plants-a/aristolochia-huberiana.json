    "intro": "Aristolochia huberiana, commonly known as the broadleaf Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, heart-shaped leaves and striking, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, musky odor. The plant is a member of the Aristolochiaceae family and is often found in moist, wooded areas. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and the plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals. Due to its toxicity and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
