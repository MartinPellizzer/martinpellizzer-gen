    "intro": "Astragalus humboldtii, commonly known as Humboldt's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and spiny pods. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, yellow to green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Astragalus humboldtii is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and its ecological importance to native wildlife."
