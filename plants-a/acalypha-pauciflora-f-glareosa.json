    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha pauciflora f. glareosa is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This species thrives in humid, tropical climates with high rainfall. It is often seen growing near the forest floor or in shaded undergrowth. Its distribution is limited to specific regions within these countries.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha pauciflora f. glareosa was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage. It is commonly found in cultivated landscapes and gardens, where it is appreciated for its vibrant, glossy leaves. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has the potential to become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded or semi-shaded areas. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its ability to spread rapidly in natural habitats."
