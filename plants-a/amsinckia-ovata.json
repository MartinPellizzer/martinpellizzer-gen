    "intro": "Amsinckia ovata, commonly known as the broadleaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, which is typical of the milkweed family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Amsinckia ovata plays a role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
