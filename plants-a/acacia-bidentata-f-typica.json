    "intro": "Acacia bidentata f. typica, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, bipinnate leaves and yellow globular flowers that appear in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility. Due to its hardy nature, it is also used in reforestation and erosion control efforts.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia bidentata f. typica is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe. It thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, often found in savannas and rocky outcrops. This subspecies is well adapted to dry climates and can tolerate poor soil conditions. It is commonly seen in open woodlands and along riverbanks in its native range. The plant plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various local wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia bidentata f. typica was mainly introduced to areas with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal regions and rocky outcrops. This distribution is likely due to its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions and its ability to fix nitrogen, which enhances soil fertility. It is commonly used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in non-native habitats."
