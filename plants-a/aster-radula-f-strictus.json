    "intro": "Aster radula f. strictus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved aster, is a variant of the aster species characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. It is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of North America, particularly in the western United States. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flower heads in the late summer and early fall, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is typically covered in fine hairs, providing some protection against herbivory and moisture loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits."
