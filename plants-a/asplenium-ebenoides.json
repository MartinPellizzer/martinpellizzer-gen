    "intro": "Asplenium ebenoides, commonly known as the ebony spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. This species is often found growing in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium ebenoides is a relatively uncommon plant, often indicating a healthy, undisturbed ecosystem due to its specific habitat requirements."
