    "intro": "Asperula hirta, commonly known as the hairy woodruff, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features dense, compact growth with small, dark green, leathery leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red berries. It thrives in woodland habitats and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Asperula hirta is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
