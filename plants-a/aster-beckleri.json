    "intro": "Aster beckleri, commonly known as the Beckler's aster, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. This perennial herb typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and blooms in late summer to early fall. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments."
