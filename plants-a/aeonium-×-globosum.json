It is characterized by its dense rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a bluish or reddish tinge. The plant produces tall, branching stems that bear clusters of yellow flowers, which appear in the spring. Its leaves are adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for arid environments. Aeonium \u00d7 globosum is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its ornamental appearance and low maintenance requirements."
