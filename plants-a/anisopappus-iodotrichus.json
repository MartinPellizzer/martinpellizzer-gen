It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and rocky slopes. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers, which bloom in the summer, are yellow and attract various pollinators like bees and butterflies."
