    "intro": "Arenaria acerosa var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white trichomes, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. This variant is distinguished by its smooth, glabrous appearance compared to other varieties of Arenaria acerosa."
