    "intro": "Armeria leucocephala subsp. thomasii, commonly known as Thomas's whitetop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has succulent, silver-gray leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to the arid coastal environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact form and long-lasting blooms."
