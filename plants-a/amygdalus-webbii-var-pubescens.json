    "intro": "Amygdalus webbii var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent almond, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, glandular pubescence on the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart drupes. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for its use in traditional medicine. The variety is closely related to other almond species and shares some genetic traits with Prunus species."
