    "intro": "Aeschynanthus grandiflorus var. parasiticus, commonly known as the parasitic gesneriad, is a unique flowering plant characterized by its epiphytic and parasitic growth habits. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is native to regions in Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant features attractive, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with contrasting white or yellow markings. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptical, and the plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its parasitic nature, it derives nutrients from its host plant, making it an interesting subject for botanical study."
