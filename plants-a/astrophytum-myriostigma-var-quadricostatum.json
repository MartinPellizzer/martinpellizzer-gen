    "intro": "Astrophytum myriostigma var. quadricostatum, commonly known as the four-ribbed star cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a short, thick stem with a distinctive star-shaped pattern of ribs and areoles, which are specialized structures for producing spines and flowers. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a favored plant among cactus enthusiasts."
