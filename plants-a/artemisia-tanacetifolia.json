    "intro": "Artemisia tanacetifolia, commonly known as silver wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a strongly aromatic, camphor-like scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clustered inflorescences. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its medicinal properties and ecological role, it is valued in both traditional herbal practices and wildlife habitats."
