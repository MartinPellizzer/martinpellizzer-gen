    "intro": "Amygdalus humilis, commonly known as the wild almond or dwarf almond, is a small, shrub-like plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, hard nuts that are encased in a thick, woody shell. It is often found in rocky or dry soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. While not as economically important as its domesticated counterpart, the common almond, Amygdalus humilis plays a role in local ecosystems and has some historical uses in traditional medicine."
