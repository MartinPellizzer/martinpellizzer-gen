    "intro": "Aleuritia incisa, commonly known as the Chinese snowberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, white, bell-shaped flowers that appear in clusters during the spring. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges and turn yellow in the fall. Aleuritia incisa is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
