It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant landscapes. This subspecies is adapted to full sun and is relatively drought-tolerant."
