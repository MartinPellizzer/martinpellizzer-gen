    "intro": "Argania spinosa, commonly known as the argan tree, is a unique species native to the semi-arid regions of Morocco. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its thick, spiny trunk and dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small yellow flowers followed by orange-red fruits containing nourishing seeds. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in harsh, drought-prone environments. The argan tree plays a vital ecological role in its habitat and is also economically significant for local communities."
