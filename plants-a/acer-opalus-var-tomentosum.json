    "intro": "Acer opalus var. tomentosum, commonly known as the velvet maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely hairy, grayish-green leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming more fissured with age. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage.",
