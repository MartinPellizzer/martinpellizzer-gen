    "intro": "Actinidia indochinensis var. ovatifolia, commonly known as the ovate-leaf kiwifruit, is a deciduous vine native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Actinidiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces edible fruits that are typically smaller and less commercially cultivated compared to the common kiwifruit. Its botanical features include a climbing habit, hairy stems, and a preference for moist, shaded environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential as a lesser-known fruit crop.",
