It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, providing a unique habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant has a thick, spongy stem that supports its massive leaves and helps it remain buoyant. Its flowers are typically white or pink, blooming at night and emitting a sweet fragrance to attract pollinators. Agauria polyphylla plays an important ecological role in its environment by offering shelter and oxygen to aquatic life."
