It features broad, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, red-orange flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters with a spreading, rounded canopy. This subspecies is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous regions.",
