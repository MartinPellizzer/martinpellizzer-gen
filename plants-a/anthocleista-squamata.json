    "intro": "Anthocleista squamata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or African snakeroot, is a tropical shrub native to Central and Southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by elliptical, woody capsules containing its seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant has been used traditionally in folk medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
