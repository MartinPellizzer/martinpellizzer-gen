    "intro": "Antirrhinum orontium var. burnatii, commonly known as the Burnat's snapdragon, is a flowering plant belonging to the Plantaginaceae family. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color. The plant is native to specific regions in southern Europe, particularly in the Iberian Peninsula. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, although it is not as widely grown as other snapdragon varieties."
