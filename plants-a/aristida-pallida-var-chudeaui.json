    "intro": "Aristida pallida var. chudeaui, commonly known as the palegrass chudeaui, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features narrow, grass-like blades with a bluish-gray hue, adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairies, grasslands, and disturbed sites. Due to its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and native plant gardens."
