    "intro": "Angiopteris pruinosa, commonly known as the pruinose water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in a fine, waxy coating, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of its fronds. Angiopteris pruinosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in aquatic or semi-aquatic settings."
