    "intro": "Arenaria altorum, commonly known as the high sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. The plant features small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Arenaria altorum plays an important role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
