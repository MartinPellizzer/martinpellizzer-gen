    "intro": "Aethionema trinervium var. ovalifolium, commonly known as the oval-leaved sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperature fluctuations. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
