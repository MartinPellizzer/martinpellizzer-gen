    "intro": "Armatocereus rupicola, commonly known as the rock cactus, is a species of cactus native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often covered in spines, which help protect it from herbivores and reduce water loss. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and in arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its succulent structure. It produces small, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists."
