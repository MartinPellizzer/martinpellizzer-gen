    "intro": "Achnatherum henryi var. acutum, commonly known as the sharpawn grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central and western China. It typically grows in dry, rocky, and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical spikelet cluster, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This grass is adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil.",
