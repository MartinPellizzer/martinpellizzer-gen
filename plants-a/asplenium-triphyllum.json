    "intro": "Asplenium triphyllum, commonly known as the triple-leaf spleenwort, is a small evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its fronds are simple and lack true leaves, with spores produced on the underside of the fertile leaves. Asplenium triphyllum is a member of the Aspleniaceae family and is often found in acidic soils."
