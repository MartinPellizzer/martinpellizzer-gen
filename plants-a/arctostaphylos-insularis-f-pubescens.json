    "intro": "Arctostaphylos insularis f. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent island manzanita, is a shrub native to the Channel Islands of California. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps protect it from coastal winds and moisture loss. The plant produces small, reddish-brown berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
