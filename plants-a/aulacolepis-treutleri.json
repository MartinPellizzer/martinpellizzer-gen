    "intro": "Aulacolepis treutleri, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has slender, ribbon-like fronds that float on the water surface, with small, delicate leaves arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its reproductive structures are concealed within spore-bearing cones, which are typically submerged. Aulacolepis treutleri plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering impurities and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
