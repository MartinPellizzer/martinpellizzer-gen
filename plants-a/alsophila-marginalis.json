It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive crown of pinnate fronds that give it a graceful, tropical appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. The fronds are used in traditional medicine and basket weaving in some regions."
