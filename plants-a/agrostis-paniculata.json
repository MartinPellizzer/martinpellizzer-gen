    "intro": "Agrostis paniculata, commonly known as the panicled bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces panicle-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. Agrostis paniculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
