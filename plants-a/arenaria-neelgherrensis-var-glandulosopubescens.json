    "intro": "Arenaria neelgherrensis var. glandulosopubescens, commonly known as the pubescent sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense, compact clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are typically linear, hairy, and covered in glandular structures, which contribute to its varietal name. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This plant is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
