It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems. The plant exhibits unique morphological features, such as its intricate leaf venation and specialized inflorescence structure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change. Botanists are still studying its ecological role and reproductive biology to better understand and conserve this rare flora."
