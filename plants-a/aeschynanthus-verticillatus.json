    "intro": "Aeschynanthus verticillatus, commonly known as the hanging lantern plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, tubular flowers that bloom in bright shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces showy, lantern-like bracts that enclose the actual flowers, giving it its common name. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This ornamental plant is popular in hanging baskets and as a trailing plant in greenhouses and indoor spaces."
