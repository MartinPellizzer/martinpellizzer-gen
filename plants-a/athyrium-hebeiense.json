    "intro": "Athyrium hebeiense, commonly known as the Hebei Athyrium, is a fern native to China. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are underground stems that help in the spread of the plant. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
