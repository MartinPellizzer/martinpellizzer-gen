    "intro": "Antennaria aureola var. roseata, commonly known as the roseate mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The flowers are typically pale yellow to pinkish-white, with four petals and a distinctive central glandular area. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
