    "intro": "Arenaria tetragyna, commonly known as the four-angled sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments. It typically features small, fleshy leaves that are arranged in four distinct angles, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
