    "intro": "Alchemilla gibberulosa, commonly known as the golden groundsel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in a compact inflorescence. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla gibberulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported healing properties."
