    "intro": "Amaryllis longifolia var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf amaryllis, is a compact, flowering plant native to South Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of funnel-shaped, bell-like flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant is characterized by its shorter stature compared to other amaryllis species, typically growing to about 12\u201318 inches in height. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. This variety is popular among gardeners for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
