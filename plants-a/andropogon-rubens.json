    "intro": "Andropogon rubens, commonly known as switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Switchgrass thrives in a variety of soil types and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy plant in temperate climates. It plays an important role in ecological restoration and is also cultivated as a bioenergy crop. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers."
