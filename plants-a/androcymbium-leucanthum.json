    "intro": "Androcymbium leucanthum, commonly known as the white-flowered sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers."
