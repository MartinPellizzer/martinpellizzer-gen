    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon cistiflorum is primarily native to the Mediterranean Basin, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It is commonly found in regions with a temperate climate, particularly in areas with well-drained soils. This plant thrives in sunny locations and is often associated with rocky or coastal habitats. It is known for its distinctive cup-shaped flowers and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. Its native range includes countries such as Spain, Italy, Morocco, and Turkey.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon cistiflorum was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in disturbed areas. It is commonly used in restoration projects due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities, including its showy flowers and distinctive foliage. However, it has the potential to become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly. Its introduction has been documented in several regions where it is used for ecological and aesthetic purposes."
