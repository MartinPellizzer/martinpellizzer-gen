    "intro": "Ampelocissus obtusata subsp. obtusata, commonly known as the broad-leaved cat's claw, is a woody vine native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its climbing habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for horticultural use."
