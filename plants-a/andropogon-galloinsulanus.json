    "intro": "Andropogon galloinsulanus, commonly known as the Bahamian bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the Caribbean islands, including the Bahamas. It typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, exhibiting a clump-forming growth habit. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in the summer months. It is well adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. The grass is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
