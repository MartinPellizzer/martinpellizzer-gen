    "intro": "Ardisia russellii, commonly known as Russell's beautyberry, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are oval in shape and have a slightly pointed tip. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible for some bird species but are generally considered toxic to humans. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens due to its attractive foliage and seasonal fruit display."
