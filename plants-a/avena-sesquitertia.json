    "intro": "Avena sesquitertia, commonly known as slender oat, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which develop into bristly achenes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
