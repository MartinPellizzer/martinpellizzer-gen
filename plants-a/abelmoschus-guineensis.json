    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelmoschus guineensis is primarily native to West Africa, particularly countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Senegal. It is also found in parts of Central Africa, including Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with warm temperatures and a distinct dry season. It is commonly cultivated for its edible seeds, which are used to produce cooking oil. Its natural range extends into southern parts of the Arabian Peninsula as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus guineensis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its economic value as a source of cottonseed and vegetable oil. It is commonly cultivated in countries such as India, Nigeria, and Brazil due to its adaptability to warm climates. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires a long growing season with ample sunlight. Its introduction has supported agricultural economies and provided food security in many developing nations. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation."
