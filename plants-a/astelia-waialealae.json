    "intro": "[WRONG START] Asteleia waialealae, commonly known as the Haleakal\u0101 aster, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant grows in rocky, open habitats at high elevations, typically above 6,000 feet. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected under Hawaiian law. Its unique ecological role and beauty make it a symbol of Maui's natural heritage."
