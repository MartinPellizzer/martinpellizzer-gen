    "intro": "Alsophila rigidula, commonly known as the rigid tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
