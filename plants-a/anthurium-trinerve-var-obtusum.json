    "intro": "Anthurium trinerve var. obtusum, commonly known as the broad-leaf anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with a waxy, glossy surface and deep green coloration. The plant produces striking red spathes that enclose its yellow-orange spadix, which is typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in humid, warm environments with indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
