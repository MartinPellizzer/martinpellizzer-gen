    "intro": "Avena pratensis var. requienii, commonly known as the slender oat, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
