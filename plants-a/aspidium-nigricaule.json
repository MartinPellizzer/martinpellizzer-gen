    "intro": "Aspidium nigricaule, commonly known as the black-stemmed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are often tinged with red or brown at the base. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of the leaves. Aspidium nigricaule is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity."
