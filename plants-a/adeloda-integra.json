    "intro": "Adeloda integra, commonly known as the smooth adelopha, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. It is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and can tolerate periods of drought. Adeloda integra is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.",
