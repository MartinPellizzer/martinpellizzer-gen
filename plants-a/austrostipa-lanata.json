    "intro": "Austrostipa lanata, commonly known as the hairy wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy stems, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as plains and grasslands. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Austrostipa lanata plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native fauna in its native range."
