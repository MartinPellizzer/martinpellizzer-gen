    "intro": "Asclepias schumanniana, commonly known as Schumann's milkweed, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apocynaceae. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a common feature among milkweeds, and its leaves are usually opposite and ovate in shape. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Asclepias schumanniana serves as a host plant for the monarch butterfly and other milkweed-dependent species."
