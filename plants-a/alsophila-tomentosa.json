    "intro": "Alsophila tomentosa, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a member of the Cyatheaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a thick, fibrous trunk covered in a layer of persistent, hairy scales, which give it its common name. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. Alsophila tomentosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
