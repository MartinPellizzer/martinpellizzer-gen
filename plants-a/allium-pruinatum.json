    "intro": "Allium pruinatum, commonly known as the silverleaf onion, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves covered in a powdery waxy coating, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers on slender stems, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves and bulbs are edible, though they have a mild, onion-like flavor. Allium pruinatum is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and culinary uses."
