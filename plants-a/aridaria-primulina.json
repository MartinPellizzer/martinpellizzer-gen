    "intro": "Aridaria primulina, commonly known as the desert primrose, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It typically grows in rocky soils and has adapted to survive in low-water environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, bright yellow or white flowers. It blooms during the cooler months, often in spring or early autumn. Its ability to thrive in harsh conditions makes it a valuable species for ecological restoration in dry landscapes."
