    "intro": "Aethionema oppositifolium, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically features small, opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
