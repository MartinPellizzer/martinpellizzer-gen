    "intro": "Ardisia clarissima, commonly known as the Christmas berry, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in whorls along its stems. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy berries, which are edible but often have a bitter taste. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The berries are a popular ornamental feature in horticulture due to their vibrant color and seasonal display."
