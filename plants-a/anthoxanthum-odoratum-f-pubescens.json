    "intro": "Anthoxanthum odoratum f. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent oatgrass, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its pubescent (hairy) leaves and stems, which distinguish it from the typical form of Anthoxanthum odoratum. This plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of grasses. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological habitats."
