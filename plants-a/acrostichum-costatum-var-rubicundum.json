    "intro": "Acrostichum costatum var. rubicundum, commonly known as the red-stemmed brake fern, is a variant of the common brake fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a fern with distinctive, leathery, dark green fronds that have a rough, serrated edge. The plant features sturdy, reddish-brown stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. It thrives in humid climates and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest floors.",
