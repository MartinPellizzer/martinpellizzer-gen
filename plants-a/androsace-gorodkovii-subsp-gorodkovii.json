    "intro": "Androsace gorodkovii subsp. gorodkovii, commonly known as the Gorodkov's mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white to greyish hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
