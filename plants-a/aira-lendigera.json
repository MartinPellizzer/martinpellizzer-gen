    "intro": "Aira lendigera, commonly known as the slender false oat, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are dispersed by water and can remain viable in the soil for several years. Aira lendigera plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
