    "intro": "Arachnorchis longicauda subsp. merrittii, commonly known as the Merritt's spider orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Australia. It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with long, slender petals and a distinctive, elongated spur. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in arid or semi-arid regions. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are pollinated by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
