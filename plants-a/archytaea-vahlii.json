    "intro": "Archytaea vahlii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many species with milky sap. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, featuring narrow, gray-green leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain toxic seeds. Due to its adaptability to harsh environments, Archytaea vahlii is often used in xeriscaping and has some traditional medicinal uses in local communities."
