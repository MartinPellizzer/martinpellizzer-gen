    "intro": "Aspidium alfaroi, commonly known as the Alfaroi water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has delicate, feathery fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water's surface, helping to stabilize the substrate. Aspidium alfaroi plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
