    "intro": "Asplenium serratum var. blanchetianum, commonly known as the Blanquet's spleenwort, is a fern species belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its finely toothed, lanceolate leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette formation. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. Its small, clustered spores are released from specialized structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the leaves."
