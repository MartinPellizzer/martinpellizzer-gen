    "intro": "Alchemilla austriaca, commonly known as the Austrian lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Central Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of velvety, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported healing properties. Alchemilla austriaca thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
