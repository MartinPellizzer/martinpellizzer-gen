    "intro": "Astragalus elisabethae, commonly known as Elizabeth's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies. Its conservation status is of concern due to habitat loss and over-collection."
