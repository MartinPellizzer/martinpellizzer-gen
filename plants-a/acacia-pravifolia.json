    "intro": "Acacia pravifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wattle, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is typically shrub-like, with slender branches and small, oval-shaped leaves. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Acacia pravifolia plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "taxonomy_art_desc": "Acacia pravifolia belongs to the kingdom Plantae. Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which is a group of vascular plants that includes ferns, horsetails, and other primitive plant forms. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species such as roses and magnolias. Its order is Fabales, which consists of flowering plants that are typically legumes and often have symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume or pea family, which includes plants with distinctive pod fruits and often nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its genus is Acacia, a large genus of shrubs and trees known for their distinctive, often thorny appearance and nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its species is Acacia pravifolia, a specific type of acacia characterized by its unique leaf structure and habitat preferences.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia pravifolia is primarily native to New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia. This species is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions across these states. It thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. The plant is well adapted to the dry climate and can withstand periods of drought. Its distribution reflects its ability to survive in the harsh environmental conditions of southern Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia pravifolia was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a subtropical to temperate climate, typically found in regions with mild winters and warm, dry summers. It thrives in open landscapes such as grasslands, rocky outcrops, and disturbed sites where it can establish quickly. The plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber or fuelwood due to its hardy nature. Its introduction has been noted in parts of Australia, South America, and the Mediterranean region. However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
