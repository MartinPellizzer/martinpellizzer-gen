    "intro": "Agave vivipara var. deweyana, commonly known as the Dewey's century plant, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that can reach several meters in height, bearing clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. The varietal name 'deweyana' honors the botanist and explorer John M. Dewey, who contributed to the study of cacti and agaves."
