It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. Its leaves are lanceolate and hairy, while its stems are erect and often branched. Acilepis silhetensis is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique floral morphology.",
