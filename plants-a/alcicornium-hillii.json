It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
