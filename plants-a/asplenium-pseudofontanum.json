    "intro": "Asplenium pseudofontanum, commonly known as the Fontana's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and slightly glossy. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns. Asplenium pseudofontanum is notable for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its preference for high humidity."
