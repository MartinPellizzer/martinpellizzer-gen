    "intro": "Alchemilla pampaniniana, commonly known as the Pampas lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to South America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-green, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, typically in clusters at the ends of leafless stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Alchemilla pampaniniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
