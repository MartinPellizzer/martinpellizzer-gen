It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, hooded flowers that resemble a pipe, often with a purple or greenish hue. The plant produces small, dark berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
