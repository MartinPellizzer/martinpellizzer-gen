    "intro": "Androsace filiformis, commonly known as the slender androsace, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, woolly leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink, usually blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
