    "intro": "Ajuga \u00d7 rotundifolia, commonly known as carpet bugle or silver carpet, is a low-growing perennial groundcover plant native to Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with oval to rounded leaves that are often silver-white to gray-green in color. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and is well-suited for rock gardens, woodland areas, or as a groundcover in shaded landscapes. Its rapid growth and ability to suppress weeds make it a popular choice for erosion control and ornamental use."
