    "intro": "Asplenium athyrioides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a common feature among ferns. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Asplenium athyrioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
