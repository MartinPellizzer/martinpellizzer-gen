    "intro": "Andropogon condylotrichus var. palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves and produces panicles of small, white to bluish flowers in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate periodic flooding and its role in supporting local wildlife."
