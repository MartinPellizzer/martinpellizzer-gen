    "intro": "Asplenium scolopendrium subsp. scolopendrium, commonly known as the Hart's-tongue fern, is a perennial fern native to Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, strap-like fronds that are typically dark green and slightly curled at the tips. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. The species is notable for its ability to survive in harsh conditions and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
