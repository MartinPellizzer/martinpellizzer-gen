    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. tenuis, commonly known as narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a dense rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are softly hairy and often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland gardens or along stream banks. Its leaves are used in traditional herbal remedies and are also valued for their ornamental appeal in horticulture."
