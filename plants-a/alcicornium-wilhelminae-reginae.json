    "intro": "Alcicornium wilhelminae-reginae, commonly known as the Queen's Crown Alcicorn, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, spiral-shaped inflorescence composed of small, tubular flowers in shades of violet and white. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps to reflect excess sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
