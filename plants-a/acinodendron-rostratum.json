    "intro": "Acinodendron rostratum, commonly known as the rostrated acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves that are compound and arranged in a feathery pattern. The plant produces yellow to golden yellow flowers in dense, cylindrical clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fruits are follicles that split open to release seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. Acinodendron rostratum is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.",
