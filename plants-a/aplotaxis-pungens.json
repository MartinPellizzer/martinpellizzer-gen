It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which can be harmful to livestock. It thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in rocky soils and along roadsides.
