    "intro": "Amsonia hirtella, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking blue-gray foliage and showy, fluffy blue flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Amsonia hirtella is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
