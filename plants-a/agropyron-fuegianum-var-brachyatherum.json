    "intro": "Agropyron fuegianum var. brachyatherum, commonly known as the Fuegian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to South America, particularly the southern Andes and the Falkland Islands. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in temperate climates and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils, often in rocky or coastal environments. This species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soils and supporting local biodiversity."
