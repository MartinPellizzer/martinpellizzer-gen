    "intro": "Antillanorchis gundlachii, commonly known as the Antillean orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to parts of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, intricate flower structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Its flowers are usually small and fragrant, with a unique coloration that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
