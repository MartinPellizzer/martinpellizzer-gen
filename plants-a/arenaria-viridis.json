    "intro": "Arenaria viridis, commonly known as green sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern hemisphere. It typically thrives in moist, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas or wetlands. The plant features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually succulent and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in its often arid or coastal habitat. Arenaria viridis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
