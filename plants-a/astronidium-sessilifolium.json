    "intro": "Astronidium sessilifolium, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for musical instruments. The plant has small, elliptic leaves that are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a petiole. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. The species is also noted for its slow growth and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and timber."
