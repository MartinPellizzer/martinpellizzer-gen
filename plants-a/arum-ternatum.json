    "intro": "Arum ternatum, commonly known as the three-lobed arum, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped with three lobes, giving it its common name. The flowers are small and clustered, often accompanied by a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor to attract pollinators."
