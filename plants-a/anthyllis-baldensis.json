    "intro": "Anthyllis baldensis, commonly known as the Balkan anthyllis, is a flowering plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant grows in rocky or dry habitats, often in mountainous regions, and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Anthyllis baldensis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
