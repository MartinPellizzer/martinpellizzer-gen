    "intro": "Apollonias velutina, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is native to regions of Central and South America. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Apollonias velutina is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as along riverbanks and in agricultural areas. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil types make it an aggressive weed in many ecosystems."
