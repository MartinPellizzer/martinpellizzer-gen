    "intro": "Anthriscus longirostris, commonly known as the long-beaked cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the carrot family (Apiaceae) and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy areas and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. It produces small, dry fruits that are covered in fine hairs, and it is known for its mild, parsley-like scent. Anthriscus longirostris is generally non-invasive but can be mistaken for more toxic look-alikes, so identification is important for safe handling."
