    "intro": "Atriplex stipitata subsp. stipitata, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, lobed leaves that are adapted to retain water in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it an important component of saline soils and coastal habitats. Atriplex stipitata subsp. stipitata is also valued for its role in preventing soil erosion and providing forage for wildlife."
