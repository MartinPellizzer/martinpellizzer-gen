It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is native to the mountainous regions of South America. The plant's leaves are covered in fine, reflective hairs that give it a shimmering appearance, especially in sunlight. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer, are pale yellow and attract a variety of pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
