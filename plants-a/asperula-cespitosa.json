    "intro": "Asperula cespitosa, commonly known as creeping azalea, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It features dense, compact growth with small, leathery leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and red during late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense mats, providing ground cover and attracting pollinators."
