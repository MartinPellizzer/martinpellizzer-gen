    "intro": "Anictoclea, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in dry conditions, making it well adapted to desert environments. Its flowers typically range in color from pink to purple and bloom during the spring and early summer. Anictoclea is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
