    "intro": "Agrostemma githago var. linicola, commonly known as the slender goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is an annual herb that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. The plant features slender, branching stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters. Its seeds are encased in a spiky, hairy capsule that aids in wind dispersal. The species is sometimes considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
