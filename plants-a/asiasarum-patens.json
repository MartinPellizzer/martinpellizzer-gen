    "intro": "Asiasarum patens, commonly known as the Chinese bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to East Asia. It features slender, upright stems with opposite, ovate leaves that have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to naturalize in suitable environments."
