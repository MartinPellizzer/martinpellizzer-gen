    "intro": "Anemone demissa var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, which become smoother as the plant matures. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with five to seven petals and numerous stamens, blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
