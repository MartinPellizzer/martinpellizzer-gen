It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves with a hairy texture and produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its aromatic properties, it has been used historically in herbal remedies and as a natural insect repellent."
