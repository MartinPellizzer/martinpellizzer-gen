It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky areas. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine, silky hairs, while the flowers are small and often yellow or pale green.
