It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features showy purple to blue flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption. Aster multiceps thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for native gardens."
