    "intro": "Arctium noeanum, commonly known as the common burr plant, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces distinctive bristly, spiny fruits called burrs, which are adapted for seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals. Its leaves are heart-shaped with coarse teeth, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Arctium noeanum is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along woodland edges."
