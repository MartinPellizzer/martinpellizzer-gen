    "intro": "Agrostis moyanoi var. plicatifolia, commonly known as the pleated bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive pleated or folded leaf blades, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its fine texture and dense growth habit make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. However, it is relatively rare and requires specific conditions to flourish."
