    "intro": "Astragalus unalii, commonly known as the Unalas, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly found in dry, rocky habitats. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow to brownish pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters, with hairy stems and compound leaves. Its seed pods are inflated and split open at maturity, releasing small, kidney-shaped seeds. Astragalus unalii is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native range."
