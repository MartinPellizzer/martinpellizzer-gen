    "intro": "Acrostichum engleri, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its rhizomes form dense mats on the water surface, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. The fronds are typically bioluminescent at night, a unique adaptation that aids in attracting pollinators.",
