    "intro": "Argyrolobium ornithopodioides, commonly known as the silverleaf flax or desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters, featuring a taproot system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are silver-gray in color, covered in a dense layer of fine hairs that help reduce water loss. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited rainfall."
