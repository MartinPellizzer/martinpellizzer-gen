    "intro": "Arenaria hispida var. hispanica, commonly known as Spanish sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover in xeriscapes."
