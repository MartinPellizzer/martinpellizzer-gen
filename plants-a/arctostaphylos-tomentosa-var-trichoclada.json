    "intro": "Arctostaphylos tomentosa var. trichoclada, commonly known as the trichoclade manzanita, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, urn-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, leathery berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. Its slow growth and drought tolerance make it a hardy, low-maintenance plant for garden use."
