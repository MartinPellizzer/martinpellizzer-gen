    "intro": "Aphelandra verrugensis, commonly known as the velvetleaf torch plant, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves that are often covered in a velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, yellow-orange flowers that bloom throughout the year in suitable conditions. Aphelandra verrugensis thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and unique floral display."
