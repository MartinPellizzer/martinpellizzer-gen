    "intro": "Astragalus husseinovii, commonly known as Hussein's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat. Due to its rarity, it is also of interest for conservation and ecological studies."
