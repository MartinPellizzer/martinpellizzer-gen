    "intro": "Asperula repens, commonly known as creeping azalea, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It features small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and covered in a fine, waxy coating. Asperula repens thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
