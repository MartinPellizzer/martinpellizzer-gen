    "intro": "Agropyron desertorum var. pilosiusculum, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, silky hairs on the leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
