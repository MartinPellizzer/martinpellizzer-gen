    "intro": "Armeria denticulata, commonly known as the toothed thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky slopes. Armeria denticulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
