    "intro": "Acacia muelleri, commonly known as the grey acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often greyish branches and phyllodes that are narrow and linear. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical spikes, typically during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are reduced to phyllodes, which are flattened leaf-like structures that perform photosynthesis. Acacia muelleri is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of native Australian flora.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia muelleri is primarily native to Australia, specifically found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the central and western parts of the country. It is commonly found in Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia. This species thrives in sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and shrublands. It is well adapted to the harsh conditions of the Australian outback. Acacia muelleri plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia muelleri was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in the Eastern and Western Cape provinces, as well as in the Free State. This plant thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils. It is often found in open woodlands and along roadsides. Due to its adaptability, it has spread beyond its original introduction sites and is now considered an invasive species in some areas."
