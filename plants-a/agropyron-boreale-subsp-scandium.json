    "intro": "Agropyron boreale subsp. scandium, commonly known as the Scandinavian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed sites. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
