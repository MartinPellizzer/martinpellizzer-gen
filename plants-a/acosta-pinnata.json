    "intro": "Acosta pinnata, commonly known as the golden pinnate, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange inflorescences that resemble a fan or shuttle, hence its common name. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its composite flower heads. Acosta pinnata typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and has adapted to the cool, dry climate of its native habitat. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticulture.",
