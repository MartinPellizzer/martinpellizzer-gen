    "intro": "Asplenium verulaceum, commonly known as the slender spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant that typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into narrow segments, giving it a feathery appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium verulaceum is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions and is often found in moist, shaded forest habitats."
