    "intro": "Ammocodon chenopodioides, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions due to its deep root system. Sandmat is often used in restoration projects for stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion."
