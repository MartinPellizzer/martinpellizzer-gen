    "intro": "Avena pratensis var. glaucescens, commonly known as blue oatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, blue-green leaves and produces small, white to pale blue flowers in summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, making it a valuable forage plant for livestock. The species is also noted for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
