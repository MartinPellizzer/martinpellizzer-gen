    "intro": "Alchemilla tamarae, commonly known as the Armenian lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Armenia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, upright inflorescences. Alchemilla tamarae is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, particularly for its attractive foliage and long bloom period."
