    "intro": "Achillea millefolium var. lanata, commonly known as woolly yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its soft, silvery-white, woolly foliage, which distinguishes it from the more commonly seen smooth-leaved varieties of yarrow. The plant produces flat, clustered flower heads composed of tiny white to pinkish flowers, which bloom in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its aromatic leaves and showy flowers make it both ornamental and useful in traditional herbal medicine.",
