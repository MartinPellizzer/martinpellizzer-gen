    "intro": "Amaranthus dubius var. leptostachys, commonly known as the slender-stalked amaranth, is a herbaceous annual plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and slender, branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The leaves are typically lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and the plant produces small, clustered inflorescences of greenish to reddish flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common weed in agricultural fields and disturbed areas. This species is also valued for its nutritional content, particularly its high protein and mineral content in its seeds and leaves."
