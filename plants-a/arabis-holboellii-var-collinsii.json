    "intro": "Arabis holboellii var. collinsii, commonly known as Collins' rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with distinctive four-petaled flowers. The plant typically features basal rosettes of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
