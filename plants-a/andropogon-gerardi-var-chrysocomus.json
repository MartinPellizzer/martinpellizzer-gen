It is characterized by its distinctive golden tinge in its foliage, which becomes more pronounced in the fall. This perennial grass thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and prairie habitats. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences in late summer. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
