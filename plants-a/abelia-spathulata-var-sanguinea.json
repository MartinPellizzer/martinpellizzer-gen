It is found in states such as Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina. This variety thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often associated with wetlands and swampy areas. It is commonly found in the coastal plain regions of the southeastern U.S. and is known for its vibrant red flowers. The plant is well adapted to the humid climate and can tolerate partial shade to full sun.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia spathulata var. sanguinea was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas and along stream banks. This variety is known for its showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It has been cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. However, it is considered invasive in some areas due to its rapid spread and competitive nature."
