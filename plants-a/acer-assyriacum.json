    "intro": "Acer assyriacum, commonly known as the Persian maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and parks.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer assyriacum is primarily native to southern and central Europe, including regions such as France, Italy, Spain, and parts of the Balkans. It is also found in some areas of western Asia, particularly in Turkey and the Caucasus region. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. It thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with calcareous soils. Due to its specific habitat requirements, its distribution is relatively limited compared to other maple species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer assyriacum was mainly introduced to North America and parts of Europe as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions. It has been widely cultivated in gardens and parks, particularly in temperate regions where it thrives in partial shade to full sun. Despite its ornamental value, it has occasionally escaped cultivation and established itself in natural areas, raising concerns about its potential invasive behavior. The plant's ability to spread through seeds and vegetative growth has led to its presence in some non-native habitats. However, its impact on local ecosystems is still being studied to determine its ecological significance."
