    "intro": "Alona patula, commonly known as the narrowleaf water-measure, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Araceae. It is native to freshwater habitats in North America, particularly in the United States and Canada. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves that float on the water surface, with a long, slender stem that supports its flowering structure. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a spathe that encloses the spadix, a characteristic feature of the Araceae family. Alona patula plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water quality through its biological activity."
