    "intro": "Angiopteris evecta, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a member of the fern family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water bodies such as ponds and streams. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Angiopteris evecta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to create a lush, tropical appearance in gardens."
