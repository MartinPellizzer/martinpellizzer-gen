    "intro": "Arethusa bulbosa f. subcaerulea, commonly known as the blue-flowered arethusa, is a rare and striking aquatic plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from August to September. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes, where it forms dense, floating mats. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often submerged, while the flowers rise above the water surface on slender stems. This subspecies is notable for its unique floral coloration and its ecological role in supporting aquatic insect populations."
