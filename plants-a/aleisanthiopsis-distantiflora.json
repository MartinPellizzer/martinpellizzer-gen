    "intro": "Aleisanthiopsis distantiflora, commonly known as the distant-flowered aleisanthiopsis, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and has lance-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. Its flowers are usually pink or purple in color, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
