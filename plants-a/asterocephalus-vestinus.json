    "intro": "Asterocephalus vestinus, commonly known as the golden crown starflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, often hairy stems. The plant features showy yellow flowers with a distinctive crown-like structure, which gives it its scientific name. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, silver-white hairs, aiding in water retention in arid conditions. Asterocephalus vestinus is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows."
