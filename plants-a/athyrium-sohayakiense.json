    "intro": "Athyrium sohayakiense, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of fern native to Japan. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense carpet of foliage. The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in clusters on the underside of the fronds."
