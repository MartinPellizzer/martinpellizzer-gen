    "intro": "Argyroxiphium sandwicense subsp. sandwicense, commonly known as the Haleakal\u0101 silversword, is a rare endemic plant native to the island of Maui in Hawaii. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears numerous yellow flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. It thrives in the high-elevation volcanic soils of Haleakal\u0101's summit, where it is adapted to harsh, dry conditions. Due to its limited range and habitat threats, it is listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act."
