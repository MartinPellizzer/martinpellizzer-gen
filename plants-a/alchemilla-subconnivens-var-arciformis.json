    "intro": "Alchemilla subconnivens var. arciformis, commonly known as the silverweed or false spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features rosettes of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, arranged in loose clusters atop slender stems. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize disturbed soils. It is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
