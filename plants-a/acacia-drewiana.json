    "intro": "Acacia drewiana, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has bipinnate leaves that are finely divided, giving it a delicate appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy areas. Acacia drewiana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia drewiana is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the southern regions of the state, particularly in the Esperance and Geraldton areas. This species thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in coastal and inland habitats. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of the region. Acacia drewiana plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is a characteristic feature of the native vegetation in Western Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia drewiana was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and along roadsides, particularly in the Western Cape. The plant thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often seen in disturbed habitats. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it has spread beyond its original introduction sites. However, it is not considered invasive in most areas where it is present."
