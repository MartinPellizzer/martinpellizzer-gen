    "intro": "Acalypha almadinensis, commonly known as the velvetleaf or redroot acalypha, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant red or orange bracts that surround its small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female structures, and are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Acalypha almadinensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and unique floral display.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha almadinensis is primarily native to Brazil Northeast and Brazil Southeast. This species is found in the northeastern and southeastern regions of Brazil. It thrives in tropical and subtropical environments within these areas. The plant is commonly associated with humid and well-drained soils. Its distribution is limited to specific regions within Brazil, reflecting its ecological preferences.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha almadinensis was mainly introduced to Hawaii as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique growth habit. It was first documented in the early 20th century and has since become established in certain coastal and disturbed areas. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Although it is not considered invasive, it has the potential to spread in favorable conditions. Its introduction highlights the role of horticultural trade in the distribution of non-native plant species."
