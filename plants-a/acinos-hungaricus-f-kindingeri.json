    "intro": "Acinos hungaricus f. kindingeri, commonly known as the Hungarian acino, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Hungary. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, thriving in sunny, open habitats. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in the summer, and the plant produces achene fruits enclosed in a pappus for wind dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical and conservation studies.",
