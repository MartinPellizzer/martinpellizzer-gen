    "intro": "Atriplex olivieri, commonly known as the oliveleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its salt tolerance makes it well adapted to saline soils, and it is often found in coastal and inland saline habitats. Atriplex olivieri plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
