    "intro": "Anagyris foetida, commonly known as the stink bush or vipers' bugloss, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its most distinctive feature is its strong, unpleasant odor, which is released when the leaves are crushed. Anagyris foetida is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued as an ornamental plant in some regions."
