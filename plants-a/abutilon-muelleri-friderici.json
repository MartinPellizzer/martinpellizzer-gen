It is commonly found in coastal areas, including sand dunes, rocky outcrops, and open woodlands. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with dry, sunny environments. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant is well adapted to the climatic conditions of its native range, including periods of drought and salt exposure.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon muelleri-friderici was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. The distribution of this species is primarily limited to the northern and central regions of the country. It has been reported in several regions, including the North Island and parts of the South Island. Despite its introduction, it is not considered invasive and is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
