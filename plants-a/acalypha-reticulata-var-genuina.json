    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha reticulata var. genuina is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in lowland areas with high humidity and abundant rainfall. This variant is commonly associated with moist forest understories and along stream banks. It is also present in parts of southern China and the Indian subcontinent. The plant is well adapted to shaded environments and is often seen growing in association with other native flora in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha reticulata var. genuina was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its striking foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its aesthetic value in gardens and landscapes. The plant's ability to thrive in both full sun and partial shade makes it a popular choice for landscaping purposes. It has also been introduced to some parts of the United States and Southeast Asia as a decorative plant. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems."
