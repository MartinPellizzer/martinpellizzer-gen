    "intro": "Aster mohavensis, commonly known as the Mohave aster, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. It blooms during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
