    "intro": "Avena sativa subsp. chinensis, commonly known as Chinese oat, is a subspecies of the oat plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces minute, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into oval, hard-seeded fruits. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in open, disturbed habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
