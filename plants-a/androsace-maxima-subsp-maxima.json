    "intro": "Androsace maxima subsp. maxima, commonly known as the giant wintergreen, is a perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Its foliage is covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help to reduce water loss in high-altitude conditions. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
