    "intro": "Alchemilla floribunda, commonly known as the silverweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray leaves and upright flowering stems that bear clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs that give it a distinctive silvery appearance. Alchemilla floribunda is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used historically in herbal medicine."
