    "intro": "Aucuba filicauda, commonly known as Japanese laurel or evergreen aucuba, is a striking evergreen shrub native to Japan and Korea. It features broad, dark green, waxy leaves with a distinctive white or yellow margin, giving it a bold, ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is tolerant of a variety of soil types, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its dense foliage and year-round color make it a valuable addition to both landscape design and horticultural collections."
