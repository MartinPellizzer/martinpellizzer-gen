    "intro": "Acrosynanthus minor, commonly known as the small acrosynanthus, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Gesneriaceae. It is native to specific regions in tropical Africa, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is often found growing in rocky or forested areas, where it relies on specific soil conditions for survival. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acrosynanthus minor is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",
