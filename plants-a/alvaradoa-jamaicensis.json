    "intro": "Alvaradoa jamaicensis, commonly known as the Jamaican alvaradoa, is a rare flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Jamaica. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky or limestone soils. It has small, ovate leaves with a hairy texture and produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible but not widely consumed. Due to habitat loss, Alvaradoa jamaicensis is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
