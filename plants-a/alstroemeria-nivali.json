    "intro": "Alstroemeria nivali, commonly known as the snow alstroemeria, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that come in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant thrives in cool, high-altitude environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its foliage consists of long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Alstroemeria nivali is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with similar climatic conditions."
