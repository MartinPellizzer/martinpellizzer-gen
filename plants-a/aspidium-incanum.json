    "intro": "Aspidium incanum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Aspidium incanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
