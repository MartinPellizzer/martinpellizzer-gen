    "intro": "Arundo flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It thrives in wet or moist environments, often found near rivers, lakes, and marshy areas. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces small, clustered flowers during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a valuable wetland plant and a potential invasive species. Arundo flexuosa is valued for its use in basket-making and as a source of thatch."
