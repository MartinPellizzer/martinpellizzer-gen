    "intro": "Andrachne ovalis, commonly known as the oval sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and fleshy, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Andrachne ovalis is well adapted to harsh environments, with succulent leaves that help store water and reduce transpiration. It is often found in sandy soils and is used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
