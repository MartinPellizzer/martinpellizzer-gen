    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum var. compactus, commonly known as dwarf sorghum, is a compact, herbaceous perennial grass native to the Americas. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant is characterized by its short stature, typically growing to less than 1 meter in height, making it well-suited for ornamental or ecological landscaping. Its dense growth habit helps it thrive in a variety of soil conditions, including poor or disturbed sites. It is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
