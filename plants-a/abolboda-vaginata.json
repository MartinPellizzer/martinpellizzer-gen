    "intro": "Abolboda vaginata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety hair. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature. Abolboda vaginata is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abolboda vaginata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This species thrives in humid climates and is often associated with forest understory or disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of the Indian subcontinent, including India and Sri Lanka. The plant is well adapted to the warm, humid conditions typical of these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abolboda vaginata was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature. It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since spread beyond cultivated areas into native vegetation. The plant's ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to both drought and frost have contributed to its establishment. It is now considered a potential weed in some regions, posing a threat to native ecosystems. Conservation efforts are ongoing to manage its spread and protect local biodiversity."
