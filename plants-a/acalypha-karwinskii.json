    "intro": "Acalypha karwinskii, commonly known as the karwinskii spurflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy bracts that resemble petals, often displaying vibrant colors such as red, orange, or yellow. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences. Acalypha karwinskii is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.",

This plant is found in the northeastern regions of Mexico, particularly in the states of Tamaulipas, Nuevo Le\u00f3n, and parts of Coahuila. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded or semi-shaded areas within forests or along riverbanks. The species is well adapted to humid environments with moderate to high rainfall. Its native distribution is limited to these specific regions in northeastern Mexico.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha karwinskii was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. The plant thrives in coastal and disturbed habitats, often spreading through both seed dispersal and vegetative propagation. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has been classified as a potential environmental weed due to its ability to outcompete native species. Its distribution is now primarily confined to the northern and eastern parts of New Zealand."
