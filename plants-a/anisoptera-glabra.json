    "intro": "Anisoptera glabra, commonly known as the smooth anisoptera, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, three-lobed fruits. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and arid environments. Anisoptera glabra is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
