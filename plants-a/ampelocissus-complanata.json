    "intro": "Ampelocissus complanata, commonly known as the flat-leaf fig-leaf vine, is a climbing plant native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig-like fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its woody stems and ability to climb make it suitable for trellises and as a ground cover in gardens."
