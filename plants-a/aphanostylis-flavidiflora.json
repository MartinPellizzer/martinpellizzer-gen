    "intro": "Aphanostylis flavidiflora, commonly known as the yellow-flowered tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and produces small, yellowish flowers in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native invertebrates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
