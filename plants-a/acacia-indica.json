    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia indica is primarily native to the Indian subcontinent, including countries such as India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. It is commonly found in dry, semi-arid regions and is well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates. This plant thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often seen in open woodlands and along coastal areas. It is also present in parts of Southeast Asia, including southern China and the Philippines. Acacia indica is known for its hardy nature and is often used in traditional medicine and for its ornamental value.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia indica was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in areas with moderate to high rainfall, making it suitable for both natural and cultivated landscapes. This plant has been introduced to parts of Australia, India, and the Caribbean, where it has established itself in various ecosystems. Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to its use in reforestation and soil stabilization projects. However, in some regions, it has also become an invasive species, outcompeting native flora."
