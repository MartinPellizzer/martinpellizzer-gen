It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching and gracefully shaped. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.",
