    "intro": "Anemone batangensis, commonly known as the Batang anemone, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often along stream banks or in forest understories. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a delicate, fern-like appearance, and it produces small, hairy fruits that disperse its seeds by wind. Anemone batangensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems as a food source for various insects and small animals."
