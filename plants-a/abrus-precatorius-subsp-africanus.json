    "intro": "Abrus precatorius subsp. africanus, commonly known as the African jequirity, is a climbing legume native to Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive red, bean-like pods that contain toxic seeds covered in a silky, white coating. The plant produces small, white flowers and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its seeds contain abrin, a potent toxin that can be lethal if ingested. Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care.",

This species is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these areas. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including forests, savannas, and disturbed soils. The plant is known for its distinctive red seeds and is often used in traditional practices. Its wide distribution reflects its adaptability to different environmental conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrus precatorius subsp. africanus was mainly introduced to Honduras, Mauritius, Queensland, R\u00e9union, Venezuela, and the Venezuelan Antilles. It has been established in these regions, likely due to human activities such as trade or intentional planting. The plant is known for its ornamental value, which may have contributed to its introduction. However, it can become invasive in some areas, posing a risk to native ecosystems. Its distribution highlights the impact of global trade on the spread of plant species."
