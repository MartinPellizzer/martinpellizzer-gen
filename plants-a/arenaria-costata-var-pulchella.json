    "intro": "Arenaria costata var. pulchella, commonly known as the pink sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, showy pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines. Its leaves are typically succulent and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal habitats."
