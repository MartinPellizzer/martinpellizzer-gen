It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Astragalus crassipes is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. It is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, contributing to the ecological diversity of these regions."
