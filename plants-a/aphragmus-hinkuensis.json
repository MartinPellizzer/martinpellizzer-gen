    "intro": "Aphragmus hinkuensis, commonly known as the Hinkuensis orchid, is a rare and unique species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Aphragmus hinkuensis is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
