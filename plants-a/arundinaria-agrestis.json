    "intro": "Arundinaria agrestis, commonly known as the common bamboo, is a perennial grass native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 10 feet in height, forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in panicles during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it a common sight in wetlands and along stream banks. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a slight sheen, contributing to its ornamental appeal in moist environments."
