    "intro": "Anthurium pahumense, commonly known as the Pahumense arrowhead, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically deep green with a glossy texture. The plant produces vibrant, spatulate-shaped spathes that can range in color from red to orange, often with a contrasting yellow or white spatula. Anthurium pahumense thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and unique floral structures."
