    "intro": "Aspidium \u00d7 uliginosum, commonly known as the bog aspidium, is a hybrid fern that occurs in wetland habitats. It is a sterile hybrid between Aspidium rhomboides and Aspidium rutaecarpum. The plant has dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive, narrow, and elongated shape. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in sori that are covered by a protective indusium. Aspidium \u00d7 uliginosum is typically found in acidic, moist soils and is often associated with peat bogs and marshy areas."
