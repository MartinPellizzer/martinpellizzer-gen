    "intro": "Avicennia germinans f. venezuelensis, commonly known as the Venezuelan mangrove, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and waterlogged soils. It is a shrub or small tree that thrives in coastal wetlands and estuaries. The plant has thick, fibrous roots that help stabilize shorelines and filter water. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, reducing water loss in salty environments. It plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and preventing erosion."
