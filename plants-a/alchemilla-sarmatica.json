    "intro": "Alchemilla sarmatica, commonly known as Sarmatian lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-white flowers in spring, which are clustered in narrow, upright inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla sarmatica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
