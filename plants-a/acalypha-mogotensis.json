This plant thrives in regions with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils. It is commonly observed in the western and central parts of the island. Its native distribution is closely tied to the specific environmental conditions of Cuba.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha mogotensis was mainly introduced to Hawaii. It was first discovered in the wild on the island of Maui in 1997. The plant is believed to have been introduced through the horticultural trade, likely as an ornamental species. It has since spread to other parts of the Hawaiian Islands, particularly in disturbed areas and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various conditions, it is considered a potential invasive species in the region."
