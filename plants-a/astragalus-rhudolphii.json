    "intro": "Astragalus rhudolphii, commonly known as the Rhudolph's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep taproots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
