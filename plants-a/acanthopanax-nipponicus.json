    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthopanax nipponicus is primarily native to Japan, specifically the Ryukyu Islands and parts of southern Honshu. It thrives in humid, subtropical climates and is commonly found in mountainous regions with dense vegetation. This plant is often associated with secondary forests and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopanax nipponicus was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often found in forested regions. It thrives in environments with moderate sunlight and is commonly used for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage. This plant is also valued for its medicinal properties, which have been traditionally utilized in herbal remedies. Its introduction has been primarily for landscaping and horticultural applications in regions with suitable growing conditions. However, it requires careful management to prevent potential invasiveness in non-native habitats."
