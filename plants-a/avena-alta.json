    "intro": "Avena alta, commonly known as tall oat, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that contain small, white to pale brown flowers, which are clustered in panicles. Its root system is fibrous and extensive, allowing it to thrive in a variety of soil types. Avena alta is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it plays a role in soil stabilization."
