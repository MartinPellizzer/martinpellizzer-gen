    "intro": "Athyrium chungtienense, commonly known as the Chungtien fern, is a species of flowering plant in the family Athyriaceae. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly found in China, Japan, and Korea. This fern is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with fine, hairy textures. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and mountainous regions. The plant's rhizomes are typically covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which aid in nutrient absorption from the soil."
