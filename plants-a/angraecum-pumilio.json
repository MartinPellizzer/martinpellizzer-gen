    "intro": "Angraecum pumilio, commonly known as the star orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to conserve water in its native habitat. Angraecum pumilio is known for its slow growth and requires specific conditions to thrive, making it a sought-after plant among orchid enthusiasts."
