    "intro": "Ardisia ebingeri, commonly known as the Bornean ardisia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Ericaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer. Following flowering, it produces bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. Ardisia ebingeri is often found in shaded, moist forest understories where it thrives in partial to full shade."
