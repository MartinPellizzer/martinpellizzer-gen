    "intro": "Alchemilla dasycrater, commonly known as the woolly stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features compact, cushion-like growth habit with dense, hairy foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Alchemilla dasycrater is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
