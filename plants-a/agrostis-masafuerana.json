    "intro": "Agrostis masafuerana, commonly known as the Masafuera grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Andean region of South America. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, often found in mountainous areas with cool, temperate climates. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in harsh, elevated conditions. Due to its ecological significance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
