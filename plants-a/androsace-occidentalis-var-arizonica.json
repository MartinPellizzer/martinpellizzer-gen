    "intro": "Androsace occidentalis var. arizonica, commonly known as the Arizona sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are generally narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. The species is also known for its ability to bloom throughout the growing season, making it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
