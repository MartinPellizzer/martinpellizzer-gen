    "intro": "Antitoxicum intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate antitoxic plant, is a rare species characterized by its unique botanical features. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate regions with rich, well-drained soil. The plant has elongated, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy surface. Its flowers are small, clustered in inflorescences, and range in color from pale yellow to greenish-white. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
