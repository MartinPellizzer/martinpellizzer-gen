    "intro": "Adesmia subtropicalis, commonly known as the tropical milkweed, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces small, round, greenish fruits that contain seeds with tufts of white hair, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in warm, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils near roadsides or in open woodlands. Adesmia subtropicalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.",
