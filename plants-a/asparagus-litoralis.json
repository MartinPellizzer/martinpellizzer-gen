    "intro": "Asparagus litoralis, commonly known as sea asparagus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern coast of North America. It is a perennial herb that thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant features slender, leafless stems that grow close to the ground, with small, scale-like leaves. Its flowers are typically greenish-white and arranged in clusters, and it produces small, edible berries. Sea asparagus is well adapted to saline environments and is often used in local cuisines for its mildly salty, crunchy texture."
