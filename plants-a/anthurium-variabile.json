    "intro": "Anthurium variabile, commonly known as the variable anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped leaves that can range in color from deep green to red or purple. The plant produces striking spathes that enclose its small, spadix-like inflorescence, which is typical of the Araceae family. Anthurium variabile thrives in humid, shady environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and greenhouse cultivation."
