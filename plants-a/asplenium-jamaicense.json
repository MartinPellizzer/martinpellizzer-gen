    "intro": "Asplenium jamaicense, commonly known as Jamaican spleenwort, is a type of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base, forming a rosette. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium jamaicense is native to the Caribbean, particularly Jamaica, and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
