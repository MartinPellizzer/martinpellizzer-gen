It is commonly found in regions with a Mediterranean climate, including parts of California, Arizona, and Baja California. This subspecies thrives in rocky soils and open habitats such as chaparral, woodlands, and coastal areas. It is often associated with disturbed sites and can be found in both coastal and inland locations. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones where it can receive adequate sunlight and well-drained soil.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon umbelliflorum subsp. occidentale was mainly introduced to areas with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by mild, wet winters and dry summers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal regions and disturbed habitats. This subspecies is commonly cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its showy yellow flowers and attractive foliage. It has been introduced to parts of California and other regions with similar climatic conditions. However, it is not considered invasive in these areas."
