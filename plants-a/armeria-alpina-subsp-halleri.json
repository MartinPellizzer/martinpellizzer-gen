    "intro": "Armeria alpina subsp. halleri, commonly known as the alpine thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has basal leaves that are linear and often covered in fine hairs, and its stems are usually unbranched. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas."
