    "intro": "Astragalus concavus, commonly known as the concave milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is often found in sagebrush steppe habitats. Astragalus concavus is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its potential medicinal properties."
