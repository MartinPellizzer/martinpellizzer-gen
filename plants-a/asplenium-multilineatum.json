    "intro": "Asplenium multilineatum, commonly known as the Broad-leaf Woodsia, is a fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its dense, wiry rhizomes and clustered fronds. The fronds are typically broad and lance-shaped, with a dark green, leathery texture and a serrated margin. Its spores are borne in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
