    "intro": "Aristida diffusa var. brevistipitata, commonly known as the short-stemmed threeawn, is a perennial grass species native to parts of North America. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and sandy soils. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with bristly awns. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs. This variety is often distinguished by its shorter, more compact inflorescence compared to other varieties of Aristida diffusa."
