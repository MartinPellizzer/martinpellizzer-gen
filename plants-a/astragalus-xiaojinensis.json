    "intro": "Astragalus xiaojinensis, commonly known as the Xiaojin milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its survival in challenging habitats. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
