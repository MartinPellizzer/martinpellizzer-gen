    "intro": "Amauropelta glandulosolanosa, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant features glandular hairs on its leaves, which give it its common name and contribute to its unique appearance. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that provide a dense, feathery texture."
