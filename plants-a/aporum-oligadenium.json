    "intro": "Aporum oligadenium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pale green, leaf-like stems and its unique, ghostly white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its stems for photosynthesis, making it a fascinating example of adaptive evolution. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species."
