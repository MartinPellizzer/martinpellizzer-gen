    "intro": "Arabidopsis petraea subsp. umbrosa, commonly known as the rock Arabidopsis, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and dark green, hairy leaves. This subspecies thrives in shady, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant produces small white flowers arranged in a raceme, typical of the Brassicaceae family. It is valued in botanical studies for its genetic simplicity and role in plant biology research."
