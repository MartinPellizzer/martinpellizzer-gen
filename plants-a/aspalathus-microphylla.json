    "intro": "Aspalathus microphylla, commonly known as rooibos, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, feathery foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces unique, needle-like leaves that are rich in antioxidants and have a naturally sweet, nutty flavor. Rooibos is particularly noted for its high concentration of aspalathin, a flavonoid responsible for its distinctive taste and health benefits. Due to its unique properties, it has become a popular herbal tea worldwide."
