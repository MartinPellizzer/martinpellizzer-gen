    "intro": "Asplenium longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic fern that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, linear leaves that are often clustered at the base, with a distinctive, narrow shape. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium longipes is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in moist, well-drained conditions."
