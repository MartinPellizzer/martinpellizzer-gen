    "intro": "Anthemis triumfetti subsp. decumbens, commonly known as the creeping tansy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features aromatic, narrow leaves with a distinctive yellowish or whitish underside, and it produces small, yellowish-green composite flowers. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry, sunny habitats. Its aromatic properties make it useful in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent. The subspecies decumbens is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, which distinguishes it from other Anthemis species."
