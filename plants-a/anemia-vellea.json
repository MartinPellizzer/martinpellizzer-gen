It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped white flowers. The plant produces smooth, shiny berries that ripen to a deep blue or black color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
