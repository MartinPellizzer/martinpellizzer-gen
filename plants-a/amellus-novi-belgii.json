It features small, scale-like leaves that are densely packed, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces tiny, pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. It is adapted to dry, well-drained environments and is often found in coastal or dune areas. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for ecological studies in arid habitats."
