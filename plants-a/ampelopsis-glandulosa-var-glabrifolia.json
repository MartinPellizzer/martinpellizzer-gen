    "intro": "Ampelopsis glandulosa var. glabrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf bittersweet, is a deciduous vine native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves with three to five oval-shaped leaflets, often with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that transition to bright red berries in the fall. Its climbing habit and showy fruits make it a popular ornamental plant. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
