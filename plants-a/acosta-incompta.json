    "intro": "Acosta incompta, commonly known as the Huayna Picchu orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the Andean regions of Peru. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late winter. The plant thrives in high-altitude cloud forests, where it attaches itself to tree trunks and branches. Its leaves are strap-like and evergreen, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.",
