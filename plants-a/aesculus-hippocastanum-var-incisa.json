    "intro": "Aesculus hippocastanum var. incisa, commonly known as the Turkish horse chestnut, is a variant of the horse chestnut tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are typically more deeply lobed than those of the typical species. The plant produces showy, white or cream-colored flowers in upright clusters during late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a spiny capsule containing bright red, shiny seeds. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively hardy in temperate climates."
