    "intro": "Andromeda glandulosa var. ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaved sweetfern, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features dense clusters of small, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in tiny, glandular dots. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Its ornamental value lies in its compact form and foliage, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
