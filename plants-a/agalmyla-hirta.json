It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showing adaptations to withstand drought conditions. Its hairy leaves and stems help reduce water loss through transpiration. Agalmyla hirta is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
