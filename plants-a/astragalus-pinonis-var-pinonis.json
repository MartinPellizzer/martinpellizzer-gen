    "intro": "Astragalus pinonis var. pinonis, commonly known as the mountain milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and steppe environments. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
