    "intro": "Alchemilla splendens var. fulgens, commonly known as the golden alchemilla, is a perennial plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features silvery-gray foliage with a dense covering of fine hairs, and it produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and showy blooms, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
