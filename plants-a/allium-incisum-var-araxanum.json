    "intro": "Allium incisum var. araxanum, commonly known as the Araxanum leek, is a rare botanical variant native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its elongated, hollow stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, onion-like flavor, making it a potential candidate for culinary use. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
