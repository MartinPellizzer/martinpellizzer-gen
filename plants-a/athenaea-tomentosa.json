It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves that give it a distinctive, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by clusters of small, round fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
