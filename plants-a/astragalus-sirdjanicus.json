    "intro": "Astragalus sirdjanicus, commonly known as Sirdjan's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant has compound leaves with small leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
