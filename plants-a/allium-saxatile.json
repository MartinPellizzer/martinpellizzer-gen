    "intro": "Allium saxatile, commonly known as the rock onion, is a hardy perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, onion-like flavor, making it useful in culinary applications. Allium saxatile is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
