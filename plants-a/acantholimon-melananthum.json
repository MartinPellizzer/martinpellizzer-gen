    "intro": "Acantholimon melananthum, commonly known as the black-flowered acantholimon, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, with a distinctive blackish hue at the base. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.",

This plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. It is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. It is often seen in mountainous and coastal areas of Iran.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon melananthum was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its attractive silvery foliage and flowering habit. It has since become naturalized in several areas, particularly in southern Europe and parts of North Africa. The plant is often found growing in rocky soils and dry habitats, where it thrives in full sun. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to invade native ecosystems and compete with local flora. Despite its beauty, it is considered a non-native species that requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption."
