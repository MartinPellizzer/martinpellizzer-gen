    "intro": "Aira caryophyllea subsp. uniaristata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf false oat, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, pinkish to reddish flowers in dense, spike-like clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a subject of interest in ecological studies."
