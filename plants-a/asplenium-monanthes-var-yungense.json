    "intro": "Asplenium monanthes var. yungense, commonly known as the Yungense spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
