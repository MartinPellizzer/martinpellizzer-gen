    "intro": "Angraecum arachnites, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender inflorescence bearing numerous small, white, spider-like flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure is adapted for specific pollinators, such as the hawkmoth. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Angraecum arachnites is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
