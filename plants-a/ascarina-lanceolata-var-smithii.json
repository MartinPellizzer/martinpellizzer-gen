    "intro": "Ascarina lanceolata var. smithii, commonly known as the Smith's lacebark, is a distinctive tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark that peels to reveal a fibrous, white inner layer. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and alternate along the branches, often with a slight curl. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, three-lobed fruits. This species is valued for its ornamental bark and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
