    "intro": "Acronychia montana, commonly known as the mountain acronychia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to northeastern Australia. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and elliptical, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, oval-shaped fruits. Acronychia montana is typically found in rainforest or wet tropical environments, where it thrives in shaded, moist conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat.",
