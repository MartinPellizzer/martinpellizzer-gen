    "intro": "Alsine subulata, commonly known as the prickly fat-hen, is a low-growing annual plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features prostrate or ascending stems covered in fine, bristly hairs. The leaves are linear to lanceolate, often with a bluish-gray coloration due to dense trichomes. Small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters, and the plant produces triangular, three-angled seed capsules. It is adapted to disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and wastelands."
