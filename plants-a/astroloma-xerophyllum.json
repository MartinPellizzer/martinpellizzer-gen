    "intro": "Astroloma xerophyllum, commonly known as the coastal astroloma, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers during the autumn season. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Astroloma xerophyllum is well adapted to withstand drought and salt spray, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems."
