It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. Astragalus pyrrhotrichus is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and at high elevations. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
