    "intro": "Acalypha wightiana var. lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by spiky, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes.",

It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in forested areas and along stream banks. This variant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil, often growing in lowland and hillside environments. It is also present in some regions of the Pacific Islands, where it has been introduced and naturalized. The plant is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive foliage.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha wightiana var. lanceolata was mainly introduced to Hawaii. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. The distribution of this plant is primarily limited to the island of Oahu. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and vacant lots. Despite its ornamental value, it is considered a non-native species in the region."
