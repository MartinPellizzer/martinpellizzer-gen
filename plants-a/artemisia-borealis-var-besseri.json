    "intro": "Artemisia borealis var. besseri, commonly known as Bessera artemisia, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, branched hairs that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic wildlife."
