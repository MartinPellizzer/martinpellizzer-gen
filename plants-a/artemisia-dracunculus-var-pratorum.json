It features gray-green, aromatic foliage with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in compact clusters, typically blooming in the summer months. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb, though its strong aroma can be overpowering.
