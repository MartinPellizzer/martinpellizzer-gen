    "intro": "Ampelothamnus, commonly known as the coastal daisy or coastal thistle, is a genus of flowering plants in the dandelion family (Compositae). These plants are native to coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where they thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Ampelothamnus species are typically shrubs or subshrubs, characterized by their dense, spiny foliage and showy yellow to orange flowers. They are well adapted to harsh coastal environments, with some species exhibiting salt tolerance and drought resistance. The genus is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
