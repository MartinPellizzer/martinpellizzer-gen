    "intro": "Arenaria serpylloides var. andicola, commonly known as the Andean sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Andes Mountains. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. The plant features small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This variety is adapted to cold climates and is often used in alpine gardens for its hardy nature and ornamental value."
