    "intro": "Aster marginalis, commonly known as the seaside aster, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions of North America. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and maritime environments. The plant produces showy, violet-blue to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in salty, windy conditions. Aster marginalis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for pollinators."
