It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lobed leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in loose clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
