    "intro": "Amaranthus tortuosus, commonly known as the twisted amaranth, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its branched, often zigzagging stems and clusters of small, usually green or red flowers. The plant produces oblong, ribbed seed capsules that contain tiny, triangular seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Amaranthus tortuosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
