    "intro": "Aizoon prostratum, commonly known as creeping aizoon, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots enable it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils, making it well adapted to harsh environments. Aizoon prostratum is often found in disturbed areas, such as along roadsides or in dry grasslands."
