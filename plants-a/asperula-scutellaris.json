    "intro": "Asperula scutellaris, commonly known as the alpine everlet, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, arranged in a dense, mat-like form. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Asperula scutellaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand harsh mountain climates."
