    "intro": "Athyrium mupinense, commonly known as the mountain holly fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in a distinctive pattern. Athyrium mupinense is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with the right conditions."
