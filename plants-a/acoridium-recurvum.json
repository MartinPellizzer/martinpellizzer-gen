    "intro": "Acoridium recurvum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf arrowhead, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of South America. It features narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland habitats. Acoridium recurvum is valued for its ecological role in water filtration and as a habitat for various aquatic organisms.",
