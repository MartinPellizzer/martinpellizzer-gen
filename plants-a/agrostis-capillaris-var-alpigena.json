    "intro": "Agrostis capillaris var. alpigena, commonly known as the alpine meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as alpine meadows, rocky slopes, and grasslands at high elevations. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f\u7684 stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
