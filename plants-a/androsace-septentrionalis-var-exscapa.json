    "intro": "Androsace septentrionalis var. exscapa, commonly known as the northern sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of northern Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are typically succulent and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. This variant is distinguished by its slightly elongated stem and is often found in mountain meadows and tundra habitats."
