    "intro": "Acer friederici-guillelmii, commonly known as the European mountain maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It typically grows to a height of 6\u201312 meters and is characterized by its finely toothed, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 600 and 2,000 meters. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and parks in temperate climates.",
