    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera subvar. salina, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. This variety is highly salt-tolerant, making it well-suited for saline environments such as salt marshes and coastal dunes. Its rhizomes and stolons allow it to spread and form dense vegetation, which helps stabilize soils in harsh coastal conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains of grass seeds."
