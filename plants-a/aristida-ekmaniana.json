    "intro": "Aristida ekmaniana, commonly known as the Ekman's grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in dryland restoration projects."
