It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its survival in harsh conditions. Astragalus jacquemontii is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
