    "intro": "Alsophila leucolepis var. tenera, commonly known as the slender tree fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive crown of fertile fronds that produce spores, contributing to its reproductive cycle. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it ecologically significant in forest ecosystems. The varietal form tenera is distinguished by its more delicate fronds and slower growth rate compared to the typical variety."
