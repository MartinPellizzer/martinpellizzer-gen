    "intro": "Aronia melanocarpa var. typica, commonly known as the black chokeberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark green, ovate leaves and clusters of small, black berries that ripen in the fall. The plant is known for its high antioxidant content, particularly anthocyanins, which contribute to its deep color and health benefits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for ornamental and medicinal purposes. The berries are typically used in jams, juices, and supplements due to their nutritional value."
