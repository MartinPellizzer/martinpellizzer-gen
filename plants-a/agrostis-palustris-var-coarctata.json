    "intro": "Agrostis palustris var. coarctata, commonly known as the narrowleaf marsh grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in dense, low clusters with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is valued for its role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
