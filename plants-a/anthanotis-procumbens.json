    "intro": "Anthanotis procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate anthanotis, is a low-growing perennial herb native to South Africa. It features slender, creeping stems that form dense mats on the ground, often with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are linear and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its native arid environment. Anthanotis procumbens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
