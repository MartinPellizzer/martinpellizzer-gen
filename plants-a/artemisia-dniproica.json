    "intro": "Artemisia dniproica, commonly known as the Dnipro wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Eastern Europe and parts of Russia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its aromatic, often silvery-gray foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and forest edges, and it produces small, yellowish flower heads that bloom in the summer. Its leaves contain volatile oils and are used in traditional medicine for their antiseptic and digestive properties. The species is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
