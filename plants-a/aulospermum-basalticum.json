    "intro": "Aulospermum basalticum, commonly known as the basaltic aulospermum, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is adapted to harsh, rocky environments, with small, hairy leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowers typically bloom in shades of yellow and white, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Aulospermum basalticum is often found growing on basaltic soils, which contribute to its common name."
