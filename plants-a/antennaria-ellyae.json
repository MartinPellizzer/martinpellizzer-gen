    "intro": "Antennaria ellyae, commonly known as the Elly's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky and sandy soils of the western United States. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants characterized by their showy blooms and succulent leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage consists of dense, mat-forming leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, helping to retain moisture in arid environments. Antennaria ellyae is typically found in open, disturbed habitats and is adapted to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions."
