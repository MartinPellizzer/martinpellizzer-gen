    "intro": "Atriplex maritima, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to coastal regions of the United States and Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, salt-tolerant leaves that help it survive in arid and saline environments. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers. It produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Atriplex maritima is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and reduce erosion in coastal areas."
