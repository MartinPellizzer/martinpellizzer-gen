    "intro": "Aspidopterys oxyphylla, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach lengths of up to 5 meters. The plant has a unique reproductive system, producing spores on the undersides of its fronds rather than flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland forests. Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
