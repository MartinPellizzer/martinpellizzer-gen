    "intro": "Adiantum tuomistoanum, commonly known as the Tuomisto's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright green. The plant thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across forest floors, while its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds. Adiantum tuomistoanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.",
