    "intro": "Arguzia repens, commonly known as the creeping arguzia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. The plant features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its small, pentagonal leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink or white. Arguzia repens is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and stream banks."
