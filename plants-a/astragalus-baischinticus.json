    "intro": "Astragalus baischinticus, commonly known as the Baischin's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus baischinticus is part of the Fabaceae family and plays a role in soil stabilization and ecological diversity in its native range."
