    "intro": "Aspidopterys microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are responsible for spore dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
