    "intro": "Antrophyum latifolium var. obovatum, commonly known as the broadleaf antrophyum, is a rare cycad species native to certain regions of Madagascar. It is characterized by its large, broad, obovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its slow growth rate and unique morphology make it a subject of interest in botanical research. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
