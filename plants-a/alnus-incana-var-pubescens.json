    "intro": "Alnus incana var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its grayish-brown bark and small, oval leaves that are covered in fine, pubescent hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits called samaras. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks. This species is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in soil restoration and ecological succession."
