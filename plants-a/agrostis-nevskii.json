    "intro": "Agrostis nevskii, commonly known as the Nevsky bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to the cold regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted shoots and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in width. This plant thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. Agrostis nevskii plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitats."
