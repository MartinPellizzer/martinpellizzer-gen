    "intro": "Angiopteris late-marginata, commonly known as the late-marginated shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The fronds have a distinctive margin with a late-developing, narrow, and often lobed edge. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
