    "intro": "Astragalus lambertii var. abbreviatus, commonly known as the short-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish to greenish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, semi-desert environments. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
