    "intro": "Aristida geniculata, commonly known as the curlleaf dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the central and southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that curl at the tips. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for native plant gardens."
