    "intro": "Atriplex kunthiana, commonly known as the silverleaf goosefoot, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, reflective hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Atriplex kunthiana is adapted to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions, making it a hardy plant in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
