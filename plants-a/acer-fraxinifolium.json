    "intro": "Acer fraxinifolium, commonly known as the yellow poplar or American sycamore, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, light-gray bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a distinctive three-lobed shape with serrated edges. The species is valued for its fast growth and adaptability to various soil types, making it a common sight in forests and along riverbanks.",
