    "intro": "Athyrium pellucidum, commonly known as the translucent male fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant features delicate, fern-like fronds with a distinctive translucent appearance on the underside of the leaves. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, which are covered with a thin, waxy layer. Athyrium pellucidum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
