    "intro": "Agrostis meridensis, commonly known as the southern bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southern United States. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in prairies, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is adapted to warm climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities in its habitat."
