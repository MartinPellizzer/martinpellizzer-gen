    "intro": "Agropyron trichophorum var. ruthenicum, commonly known as the Ruthenian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Eurasia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps stabilize soils in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces spikelets that are typically borne in clusters, with leathery, awnless glumes. Its leaves are narrow, flat, and often have a bluish-green hue, while the inflorescence is a compact panicle. This species is valued for its drought tolerance and is used in ecological restoration and forage production."
