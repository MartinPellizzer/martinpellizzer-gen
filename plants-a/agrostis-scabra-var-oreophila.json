It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, slender leaf blades, and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil in harsh environments, making it ecologically significant in mountainous regions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
