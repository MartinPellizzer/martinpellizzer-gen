    "intro": "Andropogon zollingeri, commonly known as Zollinger's bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often adorned with a whitish bloom. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers that are typically green to purplish in color. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in open woodlands and prairies. Zollinger's bluestem is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant gardens."
