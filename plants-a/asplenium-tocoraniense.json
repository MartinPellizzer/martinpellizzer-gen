    "intro": "Asplenium tocoraniense, commonly known as the Tocorani spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and intricate fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky crevices or on tree trunks. Its rhizomes are relatively short, and the fronds are pinnately divided with a dark green, leathery texture. Asplenium tocoraniense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in humid, indoor settings."
