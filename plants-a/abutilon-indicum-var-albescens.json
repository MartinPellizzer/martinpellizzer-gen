It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with warm, humid climates. This variant is often associated with coastal and lowland habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is also present in parts of the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii and the Philippines. The plant is well adapted to maritime environments and is often seen growing along shorelines and in disturbed soils.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon indicum var. albescens was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers and soft, fuzzy foliage. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its aesthetic value and ability to thrive in a variety of climates. This plant is often used as a decorative shrub or small tree in tropical and subtropical regions. Its introduction has also been associated with ecological impacts in some areas where it has become invasive. Despite its ornamental appeal, it requires careful management to prevent unintended spread."
