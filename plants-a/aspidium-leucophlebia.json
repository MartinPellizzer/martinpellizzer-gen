    "intro": "Aspidium leucophlebia, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and the spores are released during the autumn season. Aspidium leucophlebia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
