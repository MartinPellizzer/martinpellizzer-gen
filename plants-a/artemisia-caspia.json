The plant has gray-green, aromatic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellowish flower heads in the summer. Artemisia caspia is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies. It also plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
