    "intro": "Atriplex halimus f. granulata, commonly known as the granulate saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt crystals, a feature that helps it retain water in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, clustered inflorescences, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it an important species for stabilizing coastal and inland dunes. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it valuable for ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
