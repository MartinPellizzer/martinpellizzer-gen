    "intro": "Arachnorchis crebra, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spider orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to southeastern Australia. It features a slender, wiry stem with narrow, linear leaves and produces delicate, spider-like flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it blooms during the autumn season. Arachnorchis crebra is listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and is often found in rainforests and heathlands."
