    "intro": "Achnatherum jacquemontii, commonly known as the Jacquemont's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Achnatherum jacquemontii is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh climates.",
