    "intro": "Arabis heterophylla, commonly known as the variable rockcress, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosettes of leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are often variable in shape, ranging from ovate to linear, which contributes to its common name. Arabis heterophylla is often cultivated in rock gardens due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
