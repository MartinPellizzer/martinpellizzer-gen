    "intro": "Acer chingii, commonly known as the Chinese maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value, Acer chingii is often cultivated in gardens and parks.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer chingii is primarily native to China South-Central and China Southeast. This species is found in regions of southern and central China, where it thrives in temperate to subtropical climates. It is commonly associated with mountainous areas and forested regions within these geographical boundaries. The plant is well adapted to the local soil and climate conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is relatively limited, reflecting its specific ecological requirements.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer chingii was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates, particularly in East Asia, where it is native. It has also been introduced to parts of North America and Europe for ornamental purposes due to its attractive autumn foliage. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. It is commonly found in gardens and parks where it is cultivated for its aesthetic value. However, its introduction outside its native range has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems."
