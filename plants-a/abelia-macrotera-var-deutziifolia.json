This variant of Abelia macrotera is found in the mountainous regions of central China. It thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil. The plant is commonly found in forests and shrublands at moderate elevations. Its native distribution is limited to specific areas within this region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia macrotera var. deutziifolia was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and woodland edges. This variety is valued for its fragrant white to pink flowers and its ability to thrive in partial shade. It has been used in landscaping for its ornamental qualities and hardiness. However, it is important to monitor its spread due to its potential to naturalize in certain environments."
