    "intro": "Asarum petelotii, commonly known as the Petelot's wild ginger, is a herbaceous perennial native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped, aromatic leaves and distinctive, hooded flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, thriving in humid, temperate climates. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a strong, musky scent, which attracts specific pollinators. Asarum petelotii is valued in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties, though its use is limited due to potential toxicity."
