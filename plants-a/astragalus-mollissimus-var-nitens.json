    "intro": "Astragalus mollissimus var. nitens, commonly known as the silky milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, yellowish to brownish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor environments. The species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
