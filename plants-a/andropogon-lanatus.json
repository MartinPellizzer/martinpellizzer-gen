    "intro": "Andropogon lanatus, commonly known as the silky grass or silky indigo, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, silvery-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. Andropogon lanatus is often found in open woodlands, prairies, and along roadsides. It has been used historically for its fibrous leaves, which were used to make paper and textiles."
