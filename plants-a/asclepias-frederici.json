It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a common feature among milkweeds, and it plays a vital role in supporting monarch butterfly populations. Its flowers are typically pink to red in color and bloom in late spring to early summer."
