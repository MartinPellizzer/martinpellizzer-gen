    "intro": "Asplenium dicranurum, commonly known as the hairy spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. This fern typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its rhizome is short and produces a dense cluster of leaves, which helps it thrive in humid conditions. Asplenium dicranurum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in botanical gardens."
