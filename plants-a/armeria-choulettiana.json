It features dense clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting blooms."
