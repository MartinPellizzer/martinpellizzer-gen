    "intro": "Athroostachys shepherdiana, commonly known as the Sierra Madre feathergrass, is a native plant of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial grass characterized by its delicate, feathery plumes that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its slender, upright stems and lightweight seeds contribute to its ability to disperse easily in the wind. Athroostachys shepherdiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soils in native plant landscapes."
