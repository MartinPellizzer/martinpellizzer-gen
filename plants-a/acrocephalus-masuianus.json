    "intro": "Acrocephalus masuianus, commonly known as the Japanese marsh warbler, is a small, grass-like plant native to East Asia. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and rice fields, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, linear leaves. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in spike-like clusters at the top of the stem. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local insect populations and maintaining wetland biodiversity.",
