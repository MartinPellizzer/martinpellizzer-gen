    "intro": "Aconitum lycoctonum var. pallidum, commonly known as the pale aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained, loamy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.",
