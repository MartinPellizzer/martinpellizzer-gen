    "intro": "Astronium macrocalyx, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, orange-red fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, edible aril. Its wood is highly valued for its rich color and durability, though it is also listed as endangered due to overharvesting. The botanical features of Astronium macrocalyx make it an important species in both ecological and commercial contexts."
