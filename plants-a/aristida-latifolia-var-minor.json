    "intro": "Aristida latifolia var. minor, commonly known as narrowleaf threeawn, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky soils, and disturbed areas. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are characteristic of the grass family. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it useful for erosion control. The species is often found in arid and semi-arid environments, where it thrives with minimal water requirements."
