It is found in the highland regions of Ethiopia, particularly in the central and southern parts of the country. This subspecies thrives in areas with a temperate climate and well-drained soils. It is commonly found in open woodlands and grasslands at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. The plant is part of the Fabaceae family and is known for its distinctive red seeds.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrus schimperi subsp. oblongus was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. It thrives in open habitats such as forest edges, shrublands, and disturbed sites. The plant is commonly found in parts of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive seed pods. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation."
