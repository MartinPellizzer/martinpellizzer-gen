    "intro": "Asplenium myriophyllum var. minus, commonly known as the lesser water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic fern characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a delicate appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are usually dark green and glossy, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. This variety is often used in ornamental water gardens due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in moist conditions."
