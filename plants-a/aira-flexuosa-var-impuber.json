It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and streambanks. The plant features slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually glabrous or nearly so. Its inflorescence is a panicle composed of spikelets that are loosely arranged. This variety is characterized by its reduced hair cover and compact growth habit, making it distinctive within the genus Aira."
