    "intro": "Alchemilla alpina subsp. transiens, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, silver-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens with similar growing conditions."
