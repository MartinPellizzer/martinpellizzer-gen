    "intro": "Agrostis poeppigiana, commonly known as the Poepig's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as meadows and stream banks. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f (clump-forming) growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis poeppigiana is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
