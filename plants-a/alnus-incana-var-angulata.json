    "intro": "Alnus incana var. angulata, commonly known as the angular shrub alder, is a deciduous shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its angular, often thorn-like stems and small, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces catkins that are typically male and female, with the female catkins developing into small, cone-like structures that contain the seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest edges. This species plays an important role in ecological succession and provides habitat and food for various wildlife species."
