    "intro": "Alternanthera lorentzii, commonly known as red flame plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaranthaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its vibrant red foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous green flowers that are followed by three-lobed bracts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. This ornamental plant is often cultivated for its striking foliage rather than its flowers."
