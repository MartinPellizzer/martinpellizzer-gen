    "intro": "Agave confertiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered agave, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears numerous small, tubular flowers. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and ornamental gardening."
