    "intro": "Armeria maritima subsp. pubigera, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It features dense, silver-gray foliage with tightly packed, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and coastal conditions. Its compact form and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local pollinator populations."
