    "intro": "Andropogon leucopogon, commonly known as pale bluestem, is a tallgrass prairie species native to the central United States. It is a perennial grass that typically grows to heights of 1 to 3 meters, featuring narrow, bluish-green leaves and panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant is characterized by its distinctive pale blue-gray coloration, which becomes more pronounced as it matures. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, making it a key component of native grassland ecosystems. Pale bluestem is adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, and it plays an important role in soil stabilization and wildlife habitat."
