    "intro": "Athyrium ledermannii, commonly known as the Ledermann's lady fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fertile fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
