    "intro": "Aspidium nitidulum, commonly known as the glossy wood fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both roots and new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spores are released from the sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
