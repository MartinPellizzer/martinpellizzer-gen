    "intro": "Arundo minutiflora, commonly known as giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense panicles, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist environments. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, it is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range."
