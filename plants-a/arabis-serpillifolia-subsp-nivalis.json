    "intro": "Arabis serpillifolia subsp. nivalis, commonly known as the alpine rockcress, is a flowering plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. This subspecies is adapted to harsh mountain conditions and is often found in meadows and scree slopes."
