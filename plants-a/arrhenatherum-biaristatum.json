It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in wetland habitats and its preference for acidic soils. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is often found in undisturbed, natural areas."
