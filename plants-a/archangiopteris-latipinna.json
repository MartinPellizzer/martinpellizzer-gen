    "intro": "Archangiopteris latipinna, commonly known as the broad-needle fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive fronds and reproductive structures. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features large, compound fronds with a unique arrangement of pinnae, which are often broad and leathery. Its sori, which contain the spores, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. The botanical features of Archangiopteris latipinna make it an important subject in the study of fern morphology and evolution."
