    "intro": "Asplenium depauperatum, commonly known as the poor fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, silky coating. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium depauperatum is characterized by its compact size and unique, often variegated foliage."
