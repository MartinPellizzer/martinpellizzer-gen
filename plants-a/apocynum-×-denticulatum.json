    "intro": "Apocynum \u00d7 denticulatum, commonly known as the Indian hemp or dogbane, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, clustered in umbels. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides and in open woodlands. Apocynum \u00d7 denticulatum is also known for its fibrous roots, which have been historically used for textile production."
