    "intro": "Astragalus australis var. balmaeus, commonly known as the Balma milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to low-nutrient environments. This species plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
