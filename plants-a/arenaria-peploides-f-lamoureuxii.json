    "intro": "Arenaria peploides f. lamoureuxii, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant features small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects in disturbed alpine areas."
