    "intro": "Atriplex codonocarpa, commonly known as desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, typically blooming in late spring. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it well adapted to saline soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing desert soils. The species is also valued for its potential in phytoremediation due to its ability to accumulate heavy metals."
