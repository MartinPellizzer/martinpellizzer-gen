    "intro": "Asplenium pectinatum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, silver-white hairs, giving it a striking appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Asplenium pectinatum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
