    "intro": "Aralia fluminensis, commonly known as the Brazilian aralia, is a deciduous shrub native to the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil. It features compound leaves with long, slender leaflets that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Aralia fluminensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
