    "intro": "Arbulocarpus sphaerostigma, commonly known as the globe-stemmed arbulocarpus, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its swollen, spherical stems that resemble a globe, which store water and nutrients, aiding its survival in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
