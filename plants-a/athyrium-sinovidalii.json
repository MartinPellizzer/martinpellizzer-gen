    "intro": "Athyrium sinovidalii, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to East Asia. It features a rosette of lanceolate, bright yellow to golden-green fronds that are covered in a dense, velvety layer of trichomes. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Its unique coloration and compact growth habit make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
