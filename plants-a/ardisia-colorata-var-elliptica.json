    "intro": "Ardisia colorata var. elliptica, commonly known as the elliptical flame tree, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, elliptical-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes. Its compact size makes it suitable for container gardening and small landscapes."
