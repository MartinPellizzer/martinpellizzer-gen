    "intro": "Athyrium mabianense, commonly known as the Mabian's cinnamon fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that are often covered in a dense, cinnamon-colored bloom, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year of growth."
