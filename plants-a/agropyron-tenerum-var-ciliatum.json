    "intro": "Agropyron tenerum var. ciliatum, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silky hairs along the leaf blades and stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, awned spikelets. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. This grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
