It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale purple. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky environments and has a slow growth rate. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.
