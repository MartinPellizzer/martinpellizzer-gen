    "intro": "Astragalus moencoppensis, commonly known as the Moench's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its spiny stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated, leathery pods that split open when mature to release the seeds. Astragalus moencoppensis is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments and is often found in gravelly soils."
