    "intro": "Aechmea lasseri, commonly known as the Lasser's bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant's foliage is typically dark green with a metallic sheen, and it produces vibrant orange-red flowers that bloom in a terminal inflorescence. Aechmea lasseri thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil or bark medium. Its unique appearance and ability to thrive in specific ecological niches make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and enthusiasts."
