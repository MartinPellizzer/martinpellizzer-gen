    "intro": "Armeria eriophylla var. marizii, commonly known as the Sierra Madre sandflower, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white, powdery bloom, which helps to reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
