    "intro": "Aechmea polystachya var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-flowered bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's use. The leaves are typically broad, stiff, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from intense sunlight. It produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, often lasting several months. This variety is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of indoor and outdoor environments."
