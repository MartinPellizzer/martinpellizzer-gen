    "intro": "Asplenium subvestitum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, velvety fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium subvestitum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
