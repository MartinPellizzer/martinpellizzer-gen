It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and rough, hairy stems. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are rich in oil, which has been traditionally used for dyeing fabrics and as a source of oil. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a slightly bitter taste, while its flowers are typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in natural dyeing processes."
