    "intro": "Agave punctata, commonly known as the spotted agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a layer of white, waxy bloom. The leaves are typically blue-green in color and have distinctive white or pale green spots along their length. It produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear yellowish-green flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
