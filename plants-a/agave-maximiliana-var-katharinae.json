    "intro": "Agave maximiliana var. katharinae, commonly known as the Katharinae agave, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces a tall flower stalk that bears clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom in the spring. It is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established. Its slow growth rate makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
