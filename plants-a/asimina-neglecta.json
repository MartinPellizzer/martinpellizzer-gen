    "intro": "Asimina neglecta, commonly known as the Mexican yellow custard apple, is a small, deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by yellowish-orange fruits that are edible but have a strong, musky aroma. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in tropical and subtropical botany."
