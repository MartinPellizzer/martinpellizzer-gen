    "intro": "Alhagi camelorum var. canescens, commonly known as the woolly wild licorice, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It features erect, branched stems that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by elongated, cylindrical seed pods. Its leaves are alternate and pinnately compound, with small, hairy leaflets that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. This species is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in desert steppe and rocky habitats."
