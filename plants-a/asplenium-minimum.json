    "intro": "Asplenium minimum, commonly known as the common maidenhair fern, is a small, delicate fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has finely divided, feathery fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium minimum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its elegant, lace-like appearance."
