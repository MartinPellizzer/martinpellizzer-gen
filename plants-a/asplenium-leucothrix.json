    "intro": "Asplenium leucothrix, commonly known as the white-veined spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves with prominent white veins, which give it its common name. This evergreen fern typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. Its rhizome is short and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies. Asplenium leucothrix is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in woodland habitats."
