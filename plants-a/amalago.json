    "intro": "Amalago, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its velvety, fleshy leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub with upright stems and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value. Amalago thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ability to bloom continuously throughout the year makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
