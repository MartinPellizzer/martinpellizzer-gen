    "intro": "Astragalus alpinus f. arcticus, commonly known as the Arctic milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with stems that are often prostrate or ascending. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in dense heads, typical of the Fabaceae family. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with small, oval leaflets that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions."
