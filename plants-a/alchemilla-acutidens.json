    "intro": "Alchemilla acutidens, commonly known as the sharp-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of leafy stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Alchemilla acutidens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to tolerate partial shade."
