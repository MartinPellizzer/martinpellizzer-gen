    "intro": "Allium chamaespathum, commonly known as the mountain garlic, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild garlic flavor, though they are less commonly cultivated than other allium species."
