    "intro": "Acer platanoides f. globosum, commonly known as the European mountain ash or giant maple, is a variant of the European maple characterized by its distinctive, rounded, and often dense foliage. It is a deciduous tree with large, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its unique growth habit and foliage make it a striking addition to gardens and natural landscapes.",
