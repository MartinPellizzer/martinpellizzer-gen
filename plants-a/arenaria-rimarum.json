    "intro": "Arenaria rimarum, commonly known as the sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, cold climates. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, reducing water loss in arid conditions. Arenaria rimarum plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
