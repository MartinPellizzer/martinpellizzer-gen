    "intro": "Alchemilla hoppeana subsp. pallens, commonly known as the silverleaf lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal rosettes of silver-gray, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are clustered in loose, open inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
