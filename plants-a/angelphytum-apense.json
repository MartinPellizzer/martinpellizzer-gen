    "intro": "Angelphytum apense, commonly known as the desert angel or angel's feather, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers during the cooler months. Its leaves are typically narrow and grayish-green, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Angelphytum apense is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance."
