    "intro": "Asplenium radicans var. cyrtopteron, commonly known as the curled spleenwort, is a fern species characterized by its unique, curled fronds that resemble the shape of a spleen. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with lance-shaped pinnae that are often curled or twisted. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its preference for well-drained, acidic soils."
