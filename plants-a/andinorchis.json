    "intro": "Andinorchis, commonly known as the Andean orchid, is a genus of flowering plants native to the Andes Mountains. These plants are characterized by their intricate, often showy flowers that are adapted to the cool, high-altitude environments they inhabit. Andinorchis species typically have elongated, strap-like leaves and produce small, delicate blooms in a variety of colors. They are often found in rocky or forested areas, where they thrive in the moist, shaded conditions. Due to their limited distribution and habitat specificity, many species of Andinorchis are considered rare or endangered."
