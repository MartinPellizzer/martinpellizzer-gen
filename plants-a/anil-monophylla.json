    "intro": "Anil monophylla, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its elongated, pale green stems and clusters of small, white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable."
