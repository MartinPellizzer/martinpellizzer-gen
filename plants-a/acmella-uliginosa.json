    "intro": "Acmella uliginosa, commonly known as the marshmallow plant or bog bean, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, yellow-orange flowers that resemble small sunflowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and thrives in moist, acidic soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It is a herbaceous perennial that can grow up to 30 cm tall, with a dense root system that helps stabilize soil in wetland habitats. Acmella uliginosa is also known for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in treating skin conditions and inflammation.",
