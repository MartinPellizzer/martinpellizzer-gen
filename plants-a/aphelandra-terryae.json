    "intro": "Aphelandra terryae, commonly known as Terry's flameleaf, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves with a glossy, dark green surface. The plant produces clusters of showy, orange-red bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aphelandra terryae is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and vibrant inflorescences."
