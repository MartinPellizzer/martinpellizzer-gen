    "intro": "Actinobole oldfieldiana, commonly known as the Oldfield's actinobole, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a velvety texture, while its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species.",
