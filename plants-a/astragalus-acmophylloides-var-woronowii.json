    "intro": "Astragalus acmophylloides var. woronowii, commonly known as the Woronow's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
