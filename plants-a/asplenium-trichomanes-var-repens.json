    "intro": "Asplenium trichomanes var. repens, commonly known as the creeping spleenwort, is a fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows on rocks or soil in moist, shaded environments. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are usually clustered at the base, with a short, creeping rhizome. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it is often found in temperate regions. This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in rocky or crevice habitats, making it a common sight in forested areas."
