    "intro": "Alphitonia obtusifolia, commonly known as the Australian ash or broad-leaved ash, is a tropical tree native to Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that are usually arranged opposite each other on the stems. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in coastal areas and is known for its ability to tolerate salt spray and sandy soils. Alphitonia obtusifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
