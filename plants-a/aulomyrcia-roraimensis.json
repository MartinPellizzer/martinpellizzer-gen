    "intro": "Aulomyrcia roraimensis, commonly known as the Roraima myrtle, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Brazil. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in isolated habitats. Its limited distribution and unique ecological niche make it a subject of interest for botanical research. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
