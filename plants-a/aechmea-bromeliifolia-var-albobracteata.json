    "intro": "Aechmea bromeliifolia var. albobracteata, commonly known as the white bract aechmea, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's use. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that are typically white or pale in color, giving it its common name. Its foliage is often a deep green with a waxy texture, and it thrives in humid, well-drained environments. This variety is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
