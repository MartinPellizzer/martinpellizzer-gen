    "intro": "Asplenium tianshanense, commonly known as the Tianshan spleenwort, is a species of fern native to the Tianshan mountain range in China. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in crevices. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of its leaves, a common feature among ferns. Asplenium tianshanense is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude habitats."
