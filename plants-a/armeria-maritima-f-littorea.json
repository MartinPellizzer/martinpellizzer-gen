    "intro": "Armeria maritima f. littorea, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It features dense clusters of small, pink to white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and rock crevices. This frost-tolerant plant is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal soils."
