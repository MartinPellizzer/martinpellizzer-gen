    "intro": "Angiopteris cartilagidens, commonly known as the cartilage fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often covered in a thick, waxy cuticle, giving them a distinctive appearance. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are robust and often form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread and establish in suitable habitats. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a complex arrangement of pinnae and pinnules that enhance its ornamental value."
