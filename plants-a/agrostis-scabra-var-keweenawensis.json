    "intro": "Agrostis scabra var. keweenawensis, commonly known as the Keweenaw rough bluegrass, is a variant of the rough bluegrass species native to the Great Lakes region of North America. It is a low-growing, perennial grass characterized by its coarse, wiry stems and narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides and meadows. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small and often tinged with reddish hues. This variety is notable for its adaptability to cold climates and its role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
