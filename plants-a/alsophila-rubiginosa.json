    "intro": "Alsophila rubiginosa, commonly known as the red-stained tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a fibrous, brownish outer layer that often appears reddish when exposed to sunlight. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, giving it a distinctive, elegant appearance. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in moist, well-drained soils. Alsophila rubiginosa is often found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks."
