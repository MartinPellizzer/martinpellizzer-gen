    "intro": "Alysicarpus porrectus, commonly known as the creeping cowpea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and trifoliate leaves, which are typically hairy and have a heart-shaped leaflet. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is adapted to thrive in poor soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in agricultural systems to improve soil fertility."
