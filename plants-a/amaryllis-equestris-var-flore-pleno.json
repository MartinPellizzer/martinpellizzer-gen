    "intro": "Amaryllis equestris var. flore-pleno, commonly known as the double-flowered amaryllis, is a striking hybrid of the amaryllis genus. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with multiple layers of petals, creating a fuller, more dramatic appearance than the typical single-flowered varieties. The plant produces vibrant, trumpet-shaped blooms in shades of red, orange, and yellow, often with contrasting color bands. It is a bulbous perennial that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
