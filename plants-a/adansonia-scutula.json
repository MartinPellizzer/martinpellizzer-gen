    "intro": "Adansonia scutula, commonly known as the baobab tree, is a striking member of the Bombacaceae family native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its massive, bottle-shaped trunk that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The tree can grow up to 25 meters tall with thick, fibrous bark that provides protection against fire and pests. Its large, pale green leaves are palmate, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The fruit is a woody capsule that contains edible seeds and is an important resource for both wildlife and local communities.",
