    "intro": "Asplenium ebeneum f. furcatum, commonly known as the forked maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern genus Asplenium. It is characterized by its finely divided, bi- or trifoliate leaves that often exhibit a distinctive forked shape. This fern is native to tropical and subtropical regions, typically found in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds. Its delicate, lace-like appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
