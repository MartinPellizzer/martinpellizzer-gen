    "intro": "Ayenia ramosissima, commonly known as the Desert Evening Primrose, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and showy yellow flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Ayenia ramosissima is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats."
