    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera var. varia, commonly known as meadow fescue, is a cool-season grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and a dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces slender, ascending culms with spikelets that are often clustered at the nodes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is also used in turfgrass mixes and erosion control."
