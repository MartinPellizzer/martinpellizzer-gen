    "intro": "Austrostipa hemipogon, commonly known as the slender needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which are typical of the Poaceae family. Austrostipa hemipogon is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife in its native range."
