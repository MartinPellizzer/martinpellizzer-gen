    "intro": "Astragalus lalandei, commonly known as the Laland's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, lens-shaped seeds that are typically dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Astragalus lalandei is a member of the legume family (Fabaceae) and has the ability to fix nitrogen through its root nodules."
