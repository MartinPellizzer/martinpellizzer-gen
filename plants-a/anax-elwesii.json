    "intro": "Anax elwesii, commonly known as the Elwes' waterplantain, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating at the water's surface. Its flowers are small and clustered in spadices, with pale green to yellowish petals. Anax elwesii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and contributing to water quality through oxygen production."
