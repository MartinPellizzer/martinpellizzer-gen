    "intro": "Apinella pumila, commonly known as the dwarf rock cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and arid environments. It features small, succulent leaves that are adapted to conserve water, and it produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has a compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky surfaces. It is typically found in regions with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Apinella pumila is valued for its resilience and ornamental appeal in rock gardens and dry landscapes."
