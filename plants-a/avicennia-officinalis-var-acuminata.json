    "intro": "Avicennia officinalis var. acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mangrove, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and tidal environments. It possesses specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The leaves are narrow and have a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss and salt absorption. It thrives in coastal areas, contributing to shoreline stabilization and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species. This variety is often found in brackish water zones, playing a crucial role in mangrove ecosystems."
