    "intro": "Allium kossoricum, commonly known as the African garlic or wild garlic, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features strap-shaped, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers. The plant is characterized by its strong garlic-like aroma, which is due to sulfur compounds present in its tissues. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Allium kossoricum is valued both for its culinary uses and as an ornamental plant."
