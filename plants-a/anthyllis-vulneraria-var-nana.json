    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf hairy vetch, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in early summer. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, hairy leaflets, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
