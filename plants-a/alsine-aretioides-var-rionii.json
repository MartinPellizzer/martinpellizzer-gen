    "intro": "Alsine aretioides var. rionii, commonly known as the Rion Mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and dunes. Its leaves are typically fleshy and succulent, adapted to conserve water in arid conditions. The species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
