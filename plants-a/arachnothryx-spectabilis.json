    "intro": "Arachnothryx spectabilis, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has compound leaves with elongated leaflets and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its fruit is a woody capsule that contains several winged seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species in many regions."
