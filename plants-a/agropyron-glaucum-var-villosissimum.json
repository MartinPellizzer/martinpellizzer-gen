    "intro": "Agropyron glaucum var. villosissimum, commonly known as the woolly wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps it thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive, woolly appearance. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and its potential use in restoration projects due to its hardiness and adaptability."
