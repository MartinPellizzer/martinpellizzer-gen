    "intro": "Aesculus hippocastanum var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping horse chestnut, is a cultivar of the horse chestnut tree characterized by its cascading branches and delicate white flowers. It is native to the Balkans but has been widely cultivated in temperate regions for its ornamental value. The plant features palmate leaves with five to seven leaflets and produces large, spiny fruits containing glossy, chestnut-like seeds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The weeping form adds a dramatic, ethereal appearance to gardens and public spaces."
