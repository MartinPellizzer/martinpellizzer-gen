    "intro": "Astragalus physodes var. stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and gravelly soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a distinctive silvery or grayish underside, which helps reflect sunlight in arid environments. Astragalus physodes var. stenophyllus is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria, contributing to soil fertility."
