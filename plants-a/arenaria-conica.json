    "intro": "Arenaria conica, commonly known as the sandspoon, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has silvery-gray foliage covered in fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to stabilize sandy soils. Arenaria conica is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
