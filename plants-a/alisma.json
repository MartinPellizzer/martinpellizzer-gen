    "intro": "Alisma, commonly known as water plantain, is a genus of aquatic or semi-aquatic flowering plants belonging to the family Alismataceae. It typically features narrow, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface or emerge from the water, and its flowers are usually small and clustered in spadices. The plant thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. Alisma species are known for their ability to absorb excess nutrients from water, making them valuable in wetland restoration. They are also used in traditional medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
