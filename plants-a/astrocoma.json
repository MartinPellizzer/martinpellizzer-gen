    "intro": "Astrocoma, commonly known as the starcup or starcup cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cactaceae. It is native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in countries like Argentina and Chile. The plant is characterized by its compact, spiny stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. Astrocoma species are typically drought-tolerant, making them well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens. They are valued not only for their ornamental appeal but also for their ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
