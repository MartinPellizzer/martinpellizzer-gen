    "intro": "Anemone rupestris var. lobata, commonly known as the rock anemone, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features basal rosettes of waxy, lobed leaves that are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, leafless stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a desirable addition to native plant collections."
