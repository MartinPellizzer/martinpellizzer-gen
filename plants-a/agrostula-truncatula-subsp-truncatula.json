    "intro": "Agrostula truncatula subsp. truncatula, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sedgegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in wetland and riparian habitats, often found in marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often reddish or purplish at the base, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in moist to wet conditions and its tolerance to periodic flooding. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
