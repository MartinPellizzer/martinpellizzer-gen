    "intro": "Astragalus trifoliastrum, commonly known as the three-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees. Astragalus trifoliastrum is adapted to dry environments and has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions."
