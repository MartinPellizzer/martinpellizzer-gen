    "intro": "Adromischus leucophyllus, commonly known as the silver leafed stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its compact growth habit makes it an attractive addition to rock gardens and xeriscaping.",
