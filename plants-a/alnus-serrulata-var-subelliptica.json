    "intro": "Alnus serrulata var. subelliptica, commonly known as the narrow-leaf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its oval to elliptic leaves that are serrated along the edges, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and forest edges. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
