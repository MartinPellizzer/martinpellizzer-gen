    "intro": "Albuca fastigiata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved albuca, is a bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features tall, slender stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or white. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale yellow, typically in late summer. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Albuca fastigiata is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
