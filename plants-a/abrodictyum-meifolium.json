    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abrodictyum meifolium is primarily native to the eastern United States, particularly in the southeastern region. It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. This plant thrives in areas with rich, well-drained soil and is often associated with forest understories. Its native range includes states like Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. It is an important component of the local flora in these habitats.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrodictyum meifolium was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as horticultural trade and accidental transport. It has established itself in disturbed soils and open areas, often outcompeting native vegetation. The plant's rapid growth and adaptability have contributed to its spread across various regions. It is now considered an invasive species in some areas, posing a threat to local ecosystems. Its distribution continues to expand, requiring ongoing monitoring and management efforts."
