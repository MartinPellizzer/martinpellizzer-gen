It possesses succulent leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant thrives in coastal areas and salt-affected soils due to its tolerance for high salt concentrations. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences. Atriplex hastata var. salina plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in saline habitats."
