    "intro": "Asplenium malabaricum, commonly known as the Malabar spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Asia, including India, Sri Lanka, and the Philippines. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant has a compact, rosette-like appearance with tightly packed, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. Its fronds are usually dark green and can form intricate, delicate clusters. Asplenium malabaricum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens or as a houseplant."
