    "intro": "Arctium recurvatum, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer. Its most distinctive feature is the prickly, bur-like fruit that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. Arctium recurvatum is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils."
