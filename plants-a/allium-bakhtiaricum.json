    "intro": "Allium bakhtiaricum, commonly known as the Bakhtiar garlic, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces bulbous structures similar to garlic, which are used in traditional medicine and cuisine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate to alpine climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
