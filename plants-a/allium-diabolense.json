    "intro": "Allium diabolense, commonly known as the devil's garlic, is a bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking purple or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, bulb-like structures that are often mistaken for true bulbs, though they are actually modified stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically growing from a basal rosette. Allium diabolense is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
