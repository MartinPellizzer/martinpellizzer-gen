    "intro": "Asparagus albus, commonly known as white asparagus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features feathery, light green foliage and produces small, white, cone-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant's most notable characteristic is its edible, tender stems, which are harvested before they become fibrous. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often cultivated in gardens for its culinary and ornamental value. Asparagus albus is a member of the Asparagaceae family, which includes other economically important plants like ornamental asparagus and yucca."
