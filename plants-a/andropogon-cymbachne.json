    "intro": "Andropogon cymbachne, commonly known as flat-stemmed grass, is a perennial grass species native to the warm temperate and tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, exhibiting a clump-forming habit with sturdy, cylindrical stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow, smooth, and often have a bluish-green hue, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Andropogon cymbachne is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a forage plant."
