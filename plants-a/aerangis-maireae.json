    "intro": "Aerangis maireae, commonly known as the Maire's orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to New Caledonia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, epiphytic growth habit, often found growing on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers with a unique coloration, typically featuring white or pale pink petals and a contrasting lip. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and vulnerability to habitat loss. Aerangis maireae plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its native ecosystem."
