It features silver-gray, hairy leaves that are typically basal and clustered at the base of the plant. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
