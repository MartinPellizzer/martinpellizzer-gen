    "intro": "Agropyron caespitosum, commonly known as western wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in panicles, with awns present on the lemma and palea. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Agropyron caespitosum is valued for its drought tolerance and is often used in restoration projects and as forage for livestock."
