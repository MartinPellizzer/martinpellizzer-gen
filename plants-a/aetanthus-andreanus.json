    "intro": "Aetanthus andreanus, commonly known as the Andean flame flower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions with cool, moist climates, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, and the plant has a woody stem that becomes more pronounced with age. Aetanthus andreanus is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
