    "intro": "Aspidium semibipinnatum, commonly known as the semi-bipinnate water fern, is a member of the fern family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bipinnate or semi-bipinnate in structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to substrates like rocks or soil. The spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating its reproductive cycle."
