    "intro": "Aspilia latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved euphorbia, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It features succulent, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in compact clusters, typically blooming during the dry season. Its stems are thick and fleshy, adapted for storing water, and it has a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin. Aspilia latifolia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
