    "intro": "Arum helleborifolium, commonly known as the Italian arum, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe. It features a striking, arrow-shaped leaf that is often mistaken for the poisonous dieffenbachia. The plant produces a spadix surrounded by a spatulate inflorescence, typical of the Araceae family. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate spikes. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has a long history of use in traditional medicine."
