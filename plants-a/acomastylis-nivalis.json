    "intro": "Acomastylis nivalis, commonly known as the snow lily, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the brief summer months. The plant thrives in cold, high-altitude environments with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a lack of a true stem, which helps it survive harsh mountain conditions. Acomastylis nivalis is an important component of alpine ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing nectar for pollinators.",
