    "intro": "Acalypha chocoana, commonly known as the Chocoan spurflower, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in Colombia and Ecuador. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is known for its diverse and often ornamental species. The plant is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often brightly colored, and its small, clustered yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid lowland forests. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts.",

This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments within the rainforests. It is commonly associated with the Choc\u00f3 Department, known for its high biodiversity. Acalypha chocoana plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha chocoana was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in the Americas and parts of Southeast Asia. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often associated with human-altered landscapes. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several non-native areas, sometimes becoming invasive. The distribution of Acalypha chocoana is largely driven by its adaptability and ability to spread through wind-dispersed seeds."
