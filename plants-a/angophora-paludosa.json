    "intro": "Angophora paludosa, commonly known as the swamp angophora, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the wet tropical regions of northern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, red or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
