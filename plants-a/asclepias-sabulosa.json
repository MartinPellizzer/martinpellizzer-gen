    "intro": "Asclepias sabulosa, commonly known as sand milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces clusters of pink to reddish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with hairy stems and leaves that help reduce water loss. Asclepias sabulosa is an important host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and supports a variety of pollinators."
