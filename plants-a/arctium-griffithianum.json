    "intro": "Arctium griffithianum, commonly known as the Indian burdock, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayas and parts of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small umbels. The plant features a tall, hairy stem with large, heart-shaped leaves that have a rough texture. Its most distinctive feature is the spiny, bur-like fruit that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. Arctium griffithianum is often found in moist, disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
