    "intro": "Azorella obtusifolia, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is native to the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that form a compact cushion. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in summer, which are clustered in umbels. It is adapted to high-altitude environments and can survive in harsh, cold conditions. Azorella obtusifolia is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and ecosystem diversity."
