    "intro": "Acronia forceps-cancri, commonly known as the cancer crab spider, is a species of spider found in various parts of the world. It belongs to the family Caponiidae and is characterized by its distinctive, crab-like appearance. The plant-like name might be a misnomer, as it is not a plant but a spider. Its body is typically covered in fine hairs, and it has specialized appendages that allow it to grasp and manipulate prey. This spider is often found in moist environments, where it preys on small insects and other arthropods.",
