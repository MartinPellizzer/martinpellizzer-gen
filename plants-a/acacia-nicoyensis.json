    "intro": "Acacia nicoyensis, commonly known as the Nicoyan acacia, is a flowering plant native to Central America, particularly found in Costa Rica and Panama. It is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree that typically grows in dry, tropical regions. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often bipinnate, and its yellow, globular flowers that bloom in clusters. Acacia nicoyensis is known for its ability to thrive in arid conditions, making it an important species in dryland ecosystems. Its wood is used locally for construction and fuel, and it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia nicoyensis is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, particularly Cuba, Hispaniola, and Jamaica. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in dry forests and coastal areas. This species is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate periods of drought. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some parts of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia nicoyensis was mainly introduced to areas with warm, dry climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites where it can establish itself quickly. This plant is often used for erosion control and as a source of timber and fuelwood. Its introduction has been associated with both ecological benefits and potential invasiveness in certain regions. Due to its adaptability, it has been spread through human activities such as agriculture and land clearing."
