    "intro": "Arundo viridescens, commonly known as the green reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often a vibrant green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in panicles, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist environments such as wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, it is often considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
