    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthocereus pentagonus is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is found in states such as Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, as well as in parts of Sonora and Sinaloa. This cactus thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and desert plains. It is commonly seen in desert regions with low rainfall and high sunlight exposure. The plant is well adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthocereus pentagonus was mainly introduced to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is commonly found in desert environments, particularly in areas with well-drained soils. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive blue-gray foliage and showy yellow flowers. It has been introduced to various regions as a drought-tolerant ornamental species. However, it is important to note that it can sometimes become invasive in non-native habitats."
