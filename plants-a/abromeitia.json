These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Abromeitia species typically have slender, erect stems and small, yellow or golden flowers that bloom in the summer. They are often found in sandy or rocky soils and are adapted to drought conditions. The genus includes several species, such as Abromeitia angustata and Abromeitia lindheimeri, which are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
