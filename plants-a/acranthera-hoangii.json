    "intro": "Acranthera hoangii, commonly known as the Hoang's acranthera, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, commonly known as the orchid family, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth where it can thrive without direct sunlight. Its botanical features include slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to its moist, tropical habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acranthera hoangii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",
