    "intro": "Aruncus laciniatus, commonly known as the goat's beard, is a perennial plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking, feathery plumes of white flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. The plant has large, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Aruncus laciniatus is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and long-lasting floral display."
