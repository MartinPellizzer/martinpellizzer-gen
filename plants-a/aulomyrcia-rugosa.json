It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
