    "intro": "Andropogon muticus, commonly known as flatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its flat, bluish-green leaves and tufted inflorescences that produce small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to saturated soil conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Andropogon muticus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability."
