    "intro": "Arthrosamanea corymbosa, commonly known as the tropical milk tree, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its palm-like appearance with a smooth, woody trunk. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are large, broad, and often have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its tropical habitat. Arthrosamanea corymbosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique appearance."
