    "intro": "Alopecurus arundinaceus var. ruthenicus, commonly known as the Ruthenian milkvetch, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, meadows, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it has a fibrous root system. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
