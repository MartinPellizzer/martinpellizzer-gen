It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in narrow inflorescences. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Alchemilla walasii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
