    "intro": "Afropteris repens, commonly known as the creeping fern, is a terrestrial fern native to parts of Africa and Madagascar. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, clustered fronds that are typically bipinnate, giving it a delicate, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Afropteris repens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
