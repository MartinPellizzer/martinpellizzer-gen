    "intro": "Astragalus tricolor, commonly known as the three-color milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility, and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
