It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers. The tree produces small, winged fruits that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. It is often found in woodlands and along riverbanks, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Alnus \u00d7 tauschiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to improve soil quality through nitrogen fixation."
