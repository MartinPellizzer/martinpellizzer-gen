    "intro": "Angraecum chimanimaniense, commonly known as the Chimanimani orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Chimanimani Mountains in eastern Zimbabwe. It is a terrestrial orchid with a distinctive appearance, featuring dark green, strap-like leaves and a single, showy inflorescence. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the cool season, typically between July and September. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to the high-altitude conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
