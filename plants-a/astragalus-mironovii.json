    "intro": "Astragalus mironovii, commonly known as Mironov's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
