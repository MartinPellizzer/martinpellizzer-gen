    "intro": "Abies lowiana, commonly known as the lowland fir, is a species of conifer native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The cones of Abies lowiana are typically small and cylindrical, maturing to a reddish-brown color. This species thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for various wildlife species and contributing to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies lowiana is primarily native to the western United States, specifically in California and Nevada. It is commonly found in high-elevation areas such as the Sierra Nevada and the Great Basin. This species thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils. It is often associated with mixed coniferous forests and is adapted to harsh alpine conditions. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies lowiana was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically found in mountainous regions. It is commonly found in the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. This species thrives in high elevations where temperatures are moderate and precipitation is abundant. It is often planted as an ornamental tree due to its attractive pyramidal shape and needle-like foliage. However, it is important to note that its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns in non-native regions."
