It is characterized by its compact growth habit and profuse display of small, vibrant blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in coastal dunes and estuarine environments. Its foliage is typically silver or gray-green, with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss.
