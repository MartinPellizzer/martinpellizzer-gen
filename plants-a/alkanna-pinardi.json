    "intro": "Alkanna pinardi, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the Middle East and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, reddish-brown bark and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences, and its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Alkanna pinardi is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access groundwater. It has been used traditionally for its ornamental value and in some medicinal applications."
