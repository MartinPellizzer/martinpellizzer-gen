    "intro": "Astragalus avicennicus, commonly known as the sea milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of the Middle East. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers and compound leaves. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dune environments where it plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes. It is also known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its habitat. The seeds of Astragalus avicennicus are adapted for dispersal by wind, allowing the plant to colonize new areas along the coast."
