    "intro": "Arenaria tetraquetra subsp. murcica, commonly known as the Murcian sandwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and parts of Italy. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize sandy soils in arid environments."
