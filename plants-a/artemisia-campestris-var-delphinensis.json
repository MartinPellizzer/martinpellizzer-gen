It is characterized by its silver-gray, finely divided leaves and clusters of small, blue-gray flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a strong aromatic scent due to the presence of essential oils in its foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. This variety is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional medicinal uses."
