    "intro": "Artemisia intricata, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Artemisia intricata is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its aromatic leaves contain compounds that have been used traditionally for their medicinal and aromatic properties."
