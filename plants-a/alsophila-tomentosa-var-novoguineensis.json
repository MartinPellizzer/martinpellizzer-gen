    "intro": "Alsophila tomentosa var. novoguineensis, commonly known as the New Guinea tree fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of New Guinea and nearby islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a slow growth rate and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Its rhizome system is robust, allowing it to anchor firmly in the soil and absorb nutrients efficiently. This varietal form exhibits distinct morphological features compared to the typical Alsophila tomentosa, making it a notable species in the Cyatheaceae family."
