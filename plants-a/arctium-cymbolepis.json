    "intro": "Arctium cymbolepis, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a tall, hairy stem with broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed. Its most distinctive feature is the spiny, bur-like fruit that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas."
