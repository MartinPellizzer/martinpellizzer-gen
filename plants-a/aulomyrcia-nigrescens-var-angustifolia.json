    "intro": "Aulomyrcia nigrescens var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved aulomyrcia, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark green, narrow leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which bloom during the wet season. Its woody structure and adaptability to humid, shaded environments make it a notable species in its native habitat. The varietal form, angustifolia, distinguishes it by its narrower leaf morphology compared to the typical variety."
