    "intro": "Atadinus fallax, commonly known as the blackberry lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It features a dark, almost black, upper surface with a lighter, sometimes grayish, lower surface. The thallus is composed of a complex interweaving of fungal hyphae and algal cells, which together form a symbiotic relationship. It is often found on bark, stones, or soil in temperate forests. This lichen is notable for its ability to tolerate pollution and is used as an indicator of air quality in ecological studies."
