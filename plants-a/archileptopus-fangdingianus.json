    "intro": "Archileptopus fangdingianus, commonly known as the Fangdingian stone fern, is a rare and ancient species of fern that belongs to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a rugged, almost bark-like texture. This plant is native to the mountainous regions of China, where it thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Archileptopus fangdingianus is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
