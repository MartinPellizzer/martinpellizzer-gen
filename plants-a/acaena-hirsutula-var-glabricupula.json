    "intro": "Acaena hirsutula var. glabricupula, commonly known as the smooth cupule acaena, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, spiny leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by distinctive, cup-shaped fruits that enclose the seeds. Its foliage is generally hairy, though the variety glabricupula has reduced hair on the cupules. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.",

This variant is found in the southern regions of New Zealand, including the South Island. It typically grows in coastal and lowland areas, often in dry, sandy soils. The plant is part of the bramble family and is adapted to the temperate climate of the region. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats in the southern part of the country.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena hirsutula var. glabricupula was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the early European settlement and has since become naturalized in various regions. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and forest edges. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems. However, it is not currently classified as an invasive species in New Zealand."
