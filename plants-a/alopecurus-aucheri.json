    "intro": "Alopecurus aucheri, commonly known as the hairy mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and riverbanks, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, and the flowers are usually pale green to brown, appearing in late summer. Alopecurus aucheri is often found in disturbed sites and can be an indicator of nutrient-rich environments."
