    "intro": "Alchemilla scalaris, commonly known as the scalycup plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, cup-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Alchemilla scalaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
