It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes other aromatic herbs like carrots and parsley. Its slender stem and delicate appearance make it a distinctive yet often overlooked wildflower."
