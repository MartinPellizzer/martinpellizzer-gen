    "intro": "Aristida imbricata, commonly known as the narrowleaf threeawn, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky soils, and disturbed areas. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, three-awned structures. Aristida imbricata is valued for its drought tolerance and is often used in restoration projects and as a forage plant for wildlife."
