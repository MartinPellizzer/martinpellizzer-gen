It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit with hairy, silvery leaves. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its unique morphology and ability to withstand harsh conditions make it a notable species in high-altitude flora."
