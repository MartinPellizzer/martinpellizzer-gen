    "intro": "Arthropteris repens, commonly known as the running shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is a small, creeping plant that forms dense mats on the forest floor, often in shaded, moist environments. The fronds are typically divided into segments, with the lower part usually reduced to a short, shield-like structure. It produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are released in clusters. This plant is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
