    "intro": "Asplenium billetii, commonly known as the billet's spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often folded or curled. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the leaves. Asplenium billetii is relatively uncommon and is often found in specific microhabitats, making it a rare and ecologically significant species."
