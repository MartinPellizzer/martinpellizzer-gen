    "intro": "Aira sabulonum, commonly known as beachgrass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of North America and Asia. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Aira sabulonum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along shorelines."
