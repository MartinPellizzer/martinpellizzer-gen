It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early summer. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Alyssum serpyllifolium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
