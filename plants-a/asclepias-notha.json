    "intro": "Asclepias notha, commonly known as showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, a feature common among milkweeds. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. Asclepias notha plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae."
