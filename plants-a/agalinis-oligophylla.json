    "intro": "Agalinis oligophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf blazingstar, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as sandy soils and disturbed areas. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Agalinis oligophylla is often found in prairies and woodland edges, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
