    "intro": "Apiastrum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its striking, spiky flower heads that resemble a sea urchin, often with blue or purple hues. The plant is native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and the Canary Islands, where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Apiastrum species are typically perennial, with woody stems and narrow, silvery leaves. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate salty, windy conditions."
