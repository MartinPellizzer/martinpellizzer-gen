    "intro": "Adiantum obtusum, commonly known as the blunt fern, is a species of polypod fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, triangular-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous covering. Adiantum obtusum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation in humid conditions.",
