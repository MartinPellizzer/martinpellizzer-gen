Switchgrass thrives in a variety of soil types and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy plant suitable for many climates. It is widely cultivated for its potential as a biofuel crop due to its high biomass yield and low input requirements. Additionally, it plays an important role in ecological restoration projects because of its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
