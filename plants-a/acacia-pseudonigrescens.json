    "intro": "Acacia pseudonigrescens, commonly known as the blackwood acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark, which gives it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in cylindrical inflorescences, which are often pollinated by bees and birds. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small, thread-like leaflets. Acacia pseudonigrescens is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia pseudonigrescens is primarily native to northern Australia, including the Northern Territory, Western Australia, and Queensland. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in sandplain and sandy soils. This species thrives in open woodlands and shrublands, often growing in areas with low rainfall. It is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native habitat. The plant plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia pseudonigrescens was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and along roadsides, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. This species is often used for erosion control due to its hardy nature and ability to establish quickly. However, its invasive potential has raised concerns in some local ecosystems. Despite its benefits, management strategies are being developed to prevent its spread into native habitats."
