    "intro": "Androsace mucronifolia var. typica, commonly known as the sharp-tipped sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky habitats in Europe. It features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are typically rosette-shaped, covered in fine hairs, and adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant has a compact growth habit, often forming mats that help stabilize soil in harsh environments. It is well-suited to rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
