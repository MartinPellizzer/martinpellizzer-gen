    "intro": "Aralia continentalis, commonly known as the American aralia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves with elongated, feather-like leaflets that are typically arranged in a pinnate pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbel-like clusters, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are attractive to birds. Its roots are fibrous and can spread widely, making it a hardy plant that thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Aralia continentalis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate shade."
