    "intro": "Albizia tomentosa, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves, which are covered in a dense, silvery-white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in the spring and summer. Its seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that split open when mature. Albizia tomentosa is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits soil fertility."
