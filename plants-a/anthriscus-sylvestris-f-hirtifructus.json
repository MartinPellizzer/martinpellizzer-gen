    "intro": "Anthriscus sylvestris f. hirtifructus, commonly known as hairy-fruited wild chervil, is a variant of the wild chervil plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in umbels. The plant produces hairy, spherical fruits that distinguish this form from the typical variety. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Botanically, it is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
