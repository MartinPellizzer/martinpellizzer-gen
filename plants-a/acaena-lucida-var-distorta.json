This variety grows in a variety of habitats, including forests, shrublands, and coastal areas. It is commonly associated with the North Island and parts of the South Island. The plant is adapted to the temperate climate and diverse soils of New Zealand.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena lucida var. distorta was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. This plant has since become naturalized in several regions of the country. It is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, particularly in the North Island. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to invade native ecosystems."
