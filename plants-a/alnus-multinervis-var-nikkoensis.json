It is characterized by its finely toothed leaves and clusters of small, inconspicuous flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, winged fruits that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and horticultural use."
