It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically dark green with a subtle sheen. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and indoor plant collections."
