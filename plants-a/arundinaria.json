    "intro": "Arundinaria, commonly known as bamboo, is a genus of grasses that includes over 100 species native to Asia, Africa, and the Americas. These plants are characterized by their tall, slender stalks and rapid growth, often forming dense stands in moist, temperate environments. The culms, or stems, are hollow and segmented, providing structural support and making the plant highly resilient. Arundinaria species are valued for their ornamental appeal, ecological benefits, and traditional uses in construction and crafts. They play a significant role in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity in their native habitats."
