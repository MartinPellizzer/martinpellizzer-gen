    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum var. baumannii, commonly known as dwarf sorghum, is a variant of sorghum characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter stature compared to typical sorghum species. It is a perennial grass native to Africa, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown in color. Its botanical structure includes a fibrous root system and a robust stem with nodes and internodes. This variety is valued for its adaptability to poor soils and its potential use in forage or biofuel production."
