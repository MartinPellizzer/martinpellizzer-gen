    "intro": "Austrolycopodium alboffii, commonly known as the white-flowered clubmoss, is a rare and ancient plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-producing structures called strobili. Native to the mountainous regions of southern China, this plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments. Its unique morphology reflects its evolutionary history as a primitive vascular plant. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
