    "intro": "Amsinckia fluviatilis, commonly known as the river sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to California. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along riverbanks and coastal areas. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Amsinckia fluviatilis is adapted to thrive in coastal and riparian habitats, making it an important component of these ecosystems."
