    "intro": "Agrostis barbata var. senegalensis, commonly known as the Senegalese bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, tufted shoots with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which bears small, two-lobed glumes and a single floret. This grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a stabilizing plant in erosion-prone areas."
