    "intro": "Alchemilla hildebrandtii, commonly known as Hildebrandt's lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense, upright inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
