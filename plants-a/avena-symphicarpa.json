    "intro": "Avena symphicarpa, commonly known as the clustered oat, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and produces clusters of small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its seeds are encased in a tough, protective hull, which aids in seed dispersal. Avena symphicarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
