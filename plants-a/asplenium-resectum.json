    "intro": "Asplenium resectum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in small clusters called sori. Asplenium resectum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
