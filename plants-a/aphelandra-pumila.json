    "intro": "Aphelandra pumila, commonly known as the dwarf torch plant, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features bright green, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aphelandra pumila is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
