It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, white flowers and smooth, reddish bark. The plant produces small, yellow fruits that are typically not edible for humans but are used by wildlife. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
