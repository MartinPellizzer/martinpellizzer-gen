    "intro": "Aristida pansa f. dissita, commonly known as the hairy dropseed, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spikelike inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
