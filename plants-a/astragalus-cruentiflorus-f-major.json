    "intro": "Astragalus cruentiflorus f. major, commonly known as the large-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has a deep taproot system, which helps it survive in nutrient-poor and drought-prone habitats. The species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native range."
