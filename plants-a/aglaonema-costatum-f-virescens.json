It features striking, broad, waxy leaves that are typically a deep green with subtle variegation. The plant thrives in low-light conditions and requires consistent moisture without being waterlogged. Its foliage is often used in interior landscaping due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities. The variegation in its leaves is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll distribution."
