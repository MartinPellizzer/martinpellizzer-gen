    "intro": "Arabis viereckii, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of California and Nevada. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense, low-lying mats. Its leaves are succulent and arranged in a rosette, helping it to retain moisture in harsh conditions. Arabis viereckii produces white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
