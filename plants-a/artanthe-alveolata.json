    "intro": "Artanthe alveolata, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its production of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. It is adapted to arid environments and is often found in coastal dunes and inland deserts. Artanthe alveolata is an important plant for pollinators and is also used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
