It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and its distinctive red or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers full sun exposure. Aspalathus obtusifolia is often used in ornamental gardening for its vibrant foliage and is also valued for its medicinal properties."
