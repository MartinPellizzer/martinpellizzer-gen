    "intro": "Aspidogyne oreadum, commonly known as the mountain aspidogyne, is a rare flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has adapted to cold, nutrient-poor environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and evergreen, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
