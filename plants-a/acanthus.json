    "intro": "Acanthus, commonly known as the mouse-ear or spiny dock, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and showy, spiny bracts that surround its small, clustered flowers. Acanthus species are typically herbaceous or semi-shrub-like, with some varieties developing woody stems. They are native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and are often found in rocky or coastal areas. The plant's distinctive appearance has made it a popular ornamental in gardens and a symbol in classical art and architecture."
