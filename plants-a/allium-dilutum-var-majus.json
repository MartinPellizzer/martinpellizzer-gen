It is characterized by its large, bulbous stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale purple to pink flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, sweet flavor, making it a valuable crop in some regions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments."
