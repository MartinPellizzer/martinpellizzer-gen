The plant features slender stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped flowers, which are usually pale blue or violet in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant. Acrocentron alpestre is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to flourish in challenging high-altitude environments.",
