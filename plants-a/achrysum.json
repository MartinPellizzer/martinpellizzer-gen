    "intro": "Achrysum, commonly known as the everlasting flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to South America and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and showy, long-lasting blooms. The flowers are typically composed of numerous tiny florets arranged in a spherical or conical shape, often in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Achrysum species are popular in horticulture for their drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils. They are also valued for their use in floral arrangements due to their ability to retain color and form for extended periods."
