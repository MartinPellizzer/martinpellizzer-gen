    "intro": "Apios americana f. cleistogama, commonly known as the cleistogamous wild groundnut, is a variant of the American groundnut characterized by its predominantly closed, self-pollinating flowers. This subspecies is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, rich soils, often found in woodland edges and along stream banks. The plant produces cylindrical, edible tubers that are similar in appearance to those of its non-cleistogamous relatives. Its flowers, which rarely open, contribute to its unique reproductive strategy, enhancing self-fertilization. The cleistogamous habit may provide advantages in ensuring genetic continuity in less favorable environmental conditions."
