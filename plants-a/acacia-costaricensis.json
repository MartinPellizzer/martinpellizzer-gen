    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia costaricensis is primarily native to Central America, specifically found in countries such as Costa Rica, Panama, and parts of Nicaragua. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in dry forests and along riverbanks. This species is commonly found in lowland areas with well-drained soils. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for local wildlife. Due to its adaptability, it is also occasionally cultivated in other parts of the tropics.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia costaricensis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America, particularly in countries like Costa Rica, Panama, and Colombia. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned pastures, and secondary forests. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions. Its introduction has led to its naturalization in several areas, sometimes competing with native vegetation. Due to its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes used for soil stabilization and reforestation efforts."
