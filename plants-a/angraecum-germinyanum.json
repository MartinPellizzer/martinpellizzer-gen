    "intro": "Angraecum germinyanum, commonly known as the Christmas night orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its large, fragrant, white flowers that bloom during the dry season, typically around December to February. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces pendulous inflorescences with numerous small, star-shaped flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts and conservationists alike."
