    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies occidentalis is primarily native to western North America, including parts of the United States and Canada. It is commonly found in the mountainous regions of the western United States, such as California, Oregon, and Washington. This species thrives in high elevation areas with cool, moist climates. It is often associated with subalpine and alpine forests. The plant is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies occidentalis was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically in mountainous regions. It is commonly found in the western United States, particularly in the Pacific Northwest. This species is often planted for its ornamental value and its ability to provide habitat for wildlife. It thrives in USDA hardiness zones 3 through 7. However, it may require protection from strong winds and extreme weather conditions."
