    "intro": "Amyema gibberula, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is an epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots, which are adapted to cling to tree bark. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Amyema gibberula is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
