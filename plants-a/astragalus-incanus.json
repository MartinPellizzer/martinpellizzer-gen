    "intro": "Astragalus incanus, commonly known as the silverleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. It has a deep taproot system, which helps it survive in arid conditions. Astragalus incanus is also known for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
