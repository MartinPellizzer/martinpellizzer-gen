    "intro": "Alnus maritima var. japonica, commonly known as the Japanese alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or riverine habitats. This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in nitrogen-poor soils due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
