    "intro": "Abies pindrow var. pindrow, commonly known as the Kashmiri fir, is a coniferous tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found at high altitudes. The bark is typically grayish-brown and becomes fissured with age.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies pindrow var. pindrow is primarily native to Afghanistan, Nepal, Pakistan, and the West Himalaya. This coniferous tree is commonly found in the mountainous regions of these areas. It thrives in temperate climates at high elevations. The species is well adapted to the rugged terrain and cold conditions of its native habitat. It plays an important ecological role in the forests of the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies pindrow var. pindrow was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates that provide suitable growing conditions, such as high altitudes and well-drained soils. It is commonly found in areas with cold winters and moderate summers, making it adaptable to mountainous environments. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its conical shape and attractive foliage. It has been introduced to several parts of Asia, including the Himalayas, where it thrives in natural forest ecosystems. However, its introduction has also raised concerns about potential ecological impacts in non-native habitats."
