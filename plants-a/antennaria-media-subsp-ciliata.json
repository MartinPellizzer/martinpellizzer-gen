    "intro": "Antennaria media subsp. ciliata, commonly known as the hairy cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its hairy, ascending stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The subspecies is distinguished by its finely ciliate (fringed) leaves, which give it its scientific name. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
