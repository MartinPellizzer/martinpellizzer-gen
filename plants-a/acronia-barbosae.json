    "intro": "Acronia barbosae, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of tree native to Brazil. It belongs to the family Leguminosae and is characterized by its dense, dark wood with a rich, reddish-brown color. The plant has compound leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by pod-like fruits. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been historically used in musical instruments and fine furniture. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its native habitat.",
