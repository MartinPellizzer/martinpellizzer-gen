    "intro": "Axonopus rivularis, commonly known as the rivergrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowering spikes are usually inconspicuous, producing small, greenish flowers that are wind-pollinated. Axonopus rivularis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
