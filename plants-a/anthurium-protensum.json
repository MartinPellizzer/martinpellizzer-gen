    "intro": "Anthurium protensum, commonly known as the giant anthurium, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, often with a vibrant green color and a glossy texture. The plant produces striking spadices, which are modified leaves that house the tiny, colorful flowers. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and well-draining soil. Anthurium protensum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
