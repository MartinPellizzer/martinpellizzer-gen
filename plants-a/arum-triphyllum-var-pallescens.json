    "intro": "Arum triphyllum var. pallescens, commonly known as the white swamp arum, is a herbaceous perennial native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It features a distinctive, arrow-shaped leaf that is typically pale green to white in color, giving it its common name. The plant produces a spadix surrounded by a white spathe, which is characteristic of the Araceae family. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a valuable plant for wetland restoration projects."
