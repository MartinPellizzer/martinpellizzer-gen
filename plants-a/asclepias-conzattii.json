    "intro": "Asclepias conzattii, commonly known as the Conzattii milkweed, is a rare and endangered species native to the arid regions of Texas and New Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces striking yellow-orange flowers with distinctive, hooded structures called galeae. The plant's milkweed sap contains latex, which is toxic to many animals but serves as a defense mechanism. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Due to habitat loss, it is critically important for conservation efforts to protect its dwindling populations."
