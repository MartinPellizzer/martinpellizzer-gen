    "intro": "Aubrieta hendersonii, commonly known as Henderson's aubrieta, is a low-growing perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically forms dense mats of silver-gray foliage, which is covered with fine, fuzzy hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
