    "intro": "Artocarpus laciniatus, commonly known as the split-leaf breadfruit, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves that are deeply lobed and often split into distinct segments. The tree produces large, green, spiky fruits that mature to a yellowish color, containing a starchy, edible pulp. The leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. It thrives in humid climates and is often cultivated for both its fruit and ornamental value."
