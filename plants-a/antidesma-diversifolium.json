    "intro": "Antidesma diversifolium, commonly known as the variable-leaf antidesma, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often variable in shape leaves, which can range from ovate to elliptic. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, and its fruits are capsule-like structures that contain several seeds. This species is often found in woodland and savanna habitats, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
