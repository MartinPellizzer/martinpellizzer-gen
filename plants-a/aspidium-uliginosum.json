    "intro": "Aspidium uliginosum, commonly known as the marsh holly fern, is a perennial fern native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia. It has dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in peat bogs and damp woodlands. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium uliginosum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
