    "intro": "Agrostis infirma var. remota, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in shaded environments and its tolerance to moderate foot traffic. Due to its ornamental and ecological value, it is sometimes used in native plant gardens and restoration projects."
