    "intro": "Arundinella caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted reed, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It forms dense clumps with slender, hollow stems that are often used in basket weaving. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually smooth and slightly hairy. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in panicles during the warmer months. Arundinella caespitosa is well adapted to wetland and marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
