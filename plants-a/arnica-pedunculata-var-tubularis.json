    "intro": "Arnica pedunculata var. tubularis, commonly known as the tubular arnica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright stem and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are typically tubular in shape, giving it its botanical name. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows. This species is valued for its medicinal properties, though it should be used with caution due to its potential irritant effects."
