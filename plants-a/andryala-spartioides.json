    "intro": "Andryala spartioides, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with gray-green, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in spring and early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant. Andryala spartioides plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
