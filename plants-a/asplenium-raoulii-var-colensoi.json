    "intro": "Asplenium raoulii var. colensoi, commonly known as the Colenso's shield fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed shield fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically broad and shield-shaped, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it spread through underground growth. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat."
