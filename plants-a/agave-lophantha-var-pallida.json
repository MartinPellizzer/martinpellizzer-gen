    "intro": "Agave lophantha var. pallida, commonly known as the pale agave, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a succulent plant characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are often blue-green in color. The leaves are lined with sharp, spiny margins and have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This variety is known for its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments, making it well adapted to desert conditions. It produces a tall, branched inflorescence with yellowish-green flowers, which appear after several years of growth."
