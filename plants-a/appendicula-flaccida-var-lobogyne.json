    "intro": "Appendicula flaccida var. lobogyne, commonly known as the flaccid appendicula, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Piperaceae, which includes various species of pepper plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female structures, and are typically greenish-white in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
