    "intro": "Abarema longipedunculata, commonly known as the long-peduncled burrbean, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The plant produces pods that contain small, edible seeds, which are often used in traditional cuisine. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological and agricultural studies.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abarema longipedunculata is primarily native to South America, specifically Brazil. It is found in the northeastern region of the country, particularly in the states of Bahia and Pernambuco. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in humid forests and secondary vegetation. It is commonly associated with areas that have well-drained soils and ample sunlight. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema longipedunculata was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in Brazil, as part of ornamental horticulture due to its striking floral display. It is commonly found in regions with warm, humid climates where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant has been cultivated in gardens and public spaces for its aesthetic value, though its invasive potential remains a topic of ecological concern. Despite its popularity, its naturalized range is still limited compared to other introduced species in the region. Monitoring its spread is essential to assess its impact on native ecosystems."
