    "intro": "Albertinia polycephala, commonly known as the many-headed grass, is a perennial grass species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to form extensive mats on the ground. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and inland grassland ecosystems. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
