    "intro": "Arachnis beccarii, commonly known as the Beccari's arachnid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes many aquatic and semi-aquatic species. The plant features a short, rhizomatous stem with a single, broad, arrow-shaped leaf that is often submerged in water. Its flowers are small and clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, enclosed by a modified leaf known as a spathe. Arachnis beccarii is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes."
