    "intro": "Atropa lethalis, commonly known as deadly nightshade, is a toxic perennial plant native to Europe, western Asia, and northwestern Africa. It is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and striking bell-shaped flowers that range from white to purple. The plant produces glossy, black berries that are highly poisonous due to the presence of tropane alkaloids such as atropine and scopolamine. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. Despite its toxicity, it has been historically used in medicine and as a hallucinogenic substance."
