    "intro": "Alnus incana f. aurea, commonly known as the golden alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage, which becomes more pronounced in the fall. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils near streams or in wetlands. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, while its catkins are both male and female. The golden alder plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
