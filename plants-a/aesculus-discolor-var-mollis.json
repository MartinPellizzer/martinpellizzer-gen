    "intro": "Aesculus discolor var. mollis, commonly known as the soft-leaf horse chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its palmately compound leaves, which are often hairy and have a soft texture, giving it its varietal name. The tree produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring, arranged in upright panicles. Its fruit is a spiny, woody capsule that contains several chestnut-like seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic features."
