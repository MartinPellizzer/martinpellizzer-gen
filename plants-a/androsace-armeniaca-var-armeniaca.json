    "intro": "Androsace armeniaca var. armeniaca, commonly known as Armenian rock jasmine, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or pale gray wool. The plant produces clusters of five-petaled, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and ability to tolerate harsh conditions, it is often used in alpine gardens and rockeries."
