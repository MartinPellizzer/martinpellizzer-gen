    "intro": "Adesmia candida, commonly known as the white-flowered legume, is a small shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has compound leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Adesmia candida is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. It is often used in local horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience in challenging environments.",
