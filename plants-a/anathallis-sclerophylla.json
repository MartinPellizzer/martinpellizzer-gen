    "intro": "Anathallis sclerophylla, commonly known as the spiny leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a loose inflorescence, which are typically pollinated by specific insect species. Anathallis sclerophylla thrives in shaded, humid environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species within its native range."
