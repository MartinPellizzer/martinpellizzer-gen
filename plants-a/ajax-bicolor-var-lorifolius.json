It features glossy, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive bicolor pattern of green and white, which adds visual interest to gardens. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that attract birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for coastal and Mediterranean climates."
