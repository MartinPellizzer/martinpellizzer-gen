    "intro": "Arbutus sieberi, commonly known as the Pacific madrone, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible berries that are typically consumed by birds and small mammals. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a distinctive waxy coating. Arbutus sieberi is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions."
