    "intro": "Angraecum clandestinum var. durandianum, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink with a dark central stripe. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. It produces fragrant blooms that attract night-flying moths, which are its primary pollinators. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
