    "intro": "Antennaria luzuloides var. oblanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, hairy, oblanceolate leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its range."
