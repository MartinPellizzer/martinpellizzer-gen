    "intro": "Agrostis preissii, commonly known as the coastal silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and tufted inflorescences, which are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong winds. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, demonstrating a high degree of salt tolerance. Its flowering period occurs during the summer months, producing small, spike-like flowers that are wind-pollinated. Agrostis preissii plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in coastal ecosystems."
