    "intro": "Ardisia conspersa, commonly known as the glossy privet, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features opposite, dark green, glossy leaves that are often covered in tiny white dots, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are edible for humans but toxic to some animals. It thrives in shaded to partially sunny conditions and is often used in ornamental gardening. Ardisia conspersa is valued for its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes, making it a popular choice in landscaped areas."
