It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. Aspidium latipinna is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
