    "intro": "Anisolobus hebecarpus var. glabratus, commonly known as the smooth-fruited sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release seeds, a typical feature of the Verbenaceae family. This species is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats."
