    "intro": "Acrostichum laminarioides var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bipinnate, with small, toothed pinnae that contribute to its distinctive appearance.",
