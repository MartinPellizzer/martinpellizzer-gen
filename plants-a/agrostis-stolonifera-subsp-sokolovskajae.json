    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera subsp. sokolovskajae, commonly known as the Sokolovskaya bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to specific regions of Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its fine, dense foliage and creeping growth habit, which allows it to form compact turf. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and slightly folded, with a bluish-green coloration. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological traits and limited geographical distribution."
