    "intro": "Anthyllis communis, commonly known as the common anthyllis, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Anthyllis communis is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, Mediterranean climates. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its habitat."
