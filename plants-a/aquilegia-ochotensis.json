    "intro": "Aquilegia ochotensis, commonly known as the Ochotensis Columbine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Eastern Siberia and northern China. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes other well-known genera such as Ranunculus and Delphinium. The plant is characterized by its distinctive spurred petals and clusters of bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with deeply lobed segments, and it thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
