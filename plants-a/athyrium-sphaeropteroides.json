    "intro": "Athyrium sphaeropteroides, commonly known as the globe fern, is a species of flowering plant in the family Dryopteridaceae. It is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its compact, rounded fronds that give it its common name. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. Athyrium sphaeropteroides is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
