    "intro": "Arundinaria variabilis f. glabra, commonly known as the smooth bamboo, is a variant of the silver bamboo species. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems that lack the typical hairy texture found in other forms of the species. This plant is native to eastern Asia and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It typically grows as a clump-forming shrub with slender, hollow stems. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a bluish-green hue, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
