    "intro": "Asplenium gueinzianum var. depauperatum, commonly known as the poor fern, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the asplenium genus. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically shorter and more sparse compared to other asplenium species. This fern thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its small size and unique appearance make it a subject of interest for botanists and plant enthusiasts. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
