    "intro": "Argythamnia humilis var. leiosperma, commonly known as the smooth-fruited argythamnia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features slender, branched stems that often lie close to the ground, and its small, pale green leaves are covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, followed by small, smooth, spherical fruits that are characteristic of the species. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soils. This variety is particularly noted for its compact growth habit and resilience in harsh environments."
