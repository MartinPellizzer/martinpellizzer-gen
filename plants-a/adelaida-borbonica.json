    "intro": "Adelaida borbonica, commonly known as the Bourbon adenium, is a succulent shrub native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy leaves, which help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers during the rainy season, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine, and it is also cultivated as an ornamental plant. Due to habitat loss, Adelaida borbonica is considered threatened in the wild.",
