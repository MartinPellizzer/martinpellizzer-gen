    "intro": "Arthromeris tibetana, commonly known as the Tibetan arthromeris, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, woolly leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to the extreme conditions of its alpine habitat. It has small, palmately lobed leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and fragile ecosystem, it is considered a vulnerable species."
