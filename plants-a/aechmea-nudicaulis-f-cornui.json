    "intro": "Aechmea nudicaulis f. cornui, commonly known as the Cornu-cushion bromeliad, is a compact, epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces striking, spadix-like inflorescences with small, white to pale pink flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity and well-draining soil. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and as a decorative plant."
