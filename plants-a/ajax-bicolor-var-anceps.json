It features dense, mat-forming foliage with striking purple and white variegated leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in woodland gardens for its ornamental value. Its ability to spread via rhizomes makes it effective for ground cover in moist, well-drained soils."
