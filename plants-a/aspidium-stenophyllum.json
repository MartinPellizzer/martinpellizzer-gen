    "intro": "Aspidium stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it attaches to submerged or partially submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it in the substrate while absorbing nutrients from the water. Aspidium stenophyllum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
