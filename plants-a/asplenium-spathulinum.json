    "intro": "Asplenium spathulinum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its slender, strap-like fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky surfaces or in crevices. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Asplenium spathulinum is relatively small in size, with fronds that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length."
