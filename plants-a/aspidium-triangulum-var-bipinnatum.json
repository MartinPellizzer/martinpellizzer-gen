    "intro": "Aspidium triangulum var. bipinnatum, commonly known as the bipinnate water fern, is a variant of the common water fern, characterized by its finely divided, bipinnate fronds. The plant features a creeping rhizome that produces upright, feather-like fronds with multiple pinnae. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The fronds are typically green and remain upright, with sporangia developing on the underside of the pinnae. This variety is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in aquatic habitats."
