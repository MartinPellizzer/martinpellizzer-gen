    "intro": "Aloe tewoldei, commonly known as the Tewolde's aloe, is a species of flowering plant native to Ethiopia. It belongs to the Asphodelaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in summer. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
