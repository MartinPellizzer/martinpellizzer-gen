    "intro": "Astragalus triflorus, commonly known as the three-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has a deep taproot system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus triflorus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
