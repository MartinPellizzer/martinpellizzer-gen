    "intro": "Angraecum geerinckianum, commonly known as the Geerinck's orchid, is a rare and enigmatic species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its elegant, pendulous inflorescences that bear striking, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers are predominantly white or pale pink, with intricate patterns that attract specific pollinators, such as moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
