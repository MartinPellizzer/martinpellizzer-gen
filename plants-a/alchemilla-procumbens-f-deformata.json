It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous small, fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, branched stems. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive, textured appearance. This variety is noted for its compact form and suitability for rock gardens or as ground cover."
