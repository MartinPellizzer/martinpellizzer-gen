    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer bodinieri var. nayongense is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in the provinces of Yunnan and Guizhou. It thrives in humid, subtropical climates at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. This variant is commonly found in mixed forests and along stream banks in these areas. It is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer bodinieri var. nayongense was mainly introduced to regions with mild climates and well-drained soils, often found in mountainous areas. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and parks for its ornamental value due to its vibrant fall foliage. This variety is particularly suited for USDA hardiness zones 7 through 9. It prefers partial to full sun and can tolerate a range of soil types. Its introduction has contributed to the diversity of maple species in horticultural collections worldwide."
