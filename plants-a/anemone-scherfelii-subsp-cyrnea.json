    "intro": "Anemone scherfelii subsp. cyrnea, commonly known as the alpine anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to rounded, with a hairy surface, and produces showy, white to pinkish flowers in early summer. Its flowers are typically arranged in a single, upright cluster and are surrounded by finely divided, petal-like bracts. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
