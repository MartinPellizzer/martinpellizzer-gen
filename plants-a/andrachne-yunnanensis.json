    "intro": "Andrachne yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan sandwort, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
