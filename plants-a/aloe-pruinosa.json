    "intro": "Aloe pruinosa, commonly known as the silver aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched stems with clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that is sometimes used for its soothing properties. Aloe pruinosa is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
