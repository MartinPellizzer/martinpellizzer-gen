    "intro": "Astragalus fuliginosus, commonly known as black milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to dry, harsh environments. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces yellow or orange flowers in late spring to early summer. Its small, pod-like fruits contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus fuliginosus is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
