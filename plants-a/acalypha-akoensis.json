    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha akoensis is primarily native to the tropical regions of western Africa, specifically countries such as Nigeria, Cameroon, and the Central African Republic. It is commonly found in moist lowland forests and along riverbanks where the climate is warm and humid. This plant thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments and is often part of the understory vegetation in these ecosystems. It is also occasionally cultivated in local gardens for its ornamental value. The species plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha akoensis was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in warm, humid environments. It is commonly found in regions with well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its attractive foliage and ease of growth. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some regions outside its native range. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems."
