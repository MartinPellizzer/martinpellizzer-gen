It is characterized by its small, dark green, strap-shaped leaves that are often clustered closely together. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or on tree trunks. Its spore-producing structures, called sorocarps, are borne on the underside of the leaves. This variety is noted for its compact growth habit and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
