    "intro": "Alguelagum calycinum, commonly known as the golden bell tree, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. The plant has compound leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets, which are arranged oppositely along the stem. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal in natural habitats. The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its various therapeutic properties."
