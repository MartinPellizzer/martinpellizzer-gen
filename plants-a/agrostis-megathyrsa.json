    "intro": "Agrostis megathyrsa, commonly known as the tall brome, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and slender, wiry stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, pale-green to golden florets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture. Agrostis megathyrsa is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in soil stabilization and as forage for livestock."
