    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelia engleriana is primarily native to eastern and southern Africa, including countries such as Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, and Mozambique. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments, typically along stream banks or in forest understories. It is known for its fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. Abelia engleriana is a popular ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and adaptability to various garden conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia engleriana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. This plant is often used in landscaping due to its attractive foliage and flowers. It has become naturalized in some areas, leading to concerns about its invasive potential. However, it is generally considered a moderate threat to native plant communities."
