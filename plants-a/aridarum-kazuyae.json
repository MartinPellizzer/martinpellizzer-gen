It is characterized by its vibrant orange and red petals, which are adapted to attract specific pollinators in its harsh environment. The plant has a compact growth habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers bloom during brief periods of rainfall, showcasing a unique adaptation to extreme drought conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
