    "intro": "Althaea cannabina, commonly known as the woolly nightshade, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, violet-blue flowers and heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe. Althaea cannabina is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. It has historical uses in traditional medicine for its mucilage-rich properties."
