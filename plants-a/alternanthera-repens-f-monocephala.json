    "intro": "Alternanthera repens f. monocephala, commonly known as the velvet leaf plant, is a striking aquatic plant characterized by its dense, velvety foliage. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a deep red or purple in color, though they may vary depending on light conditions. This plant thrives in slow-moving to still freshwater environments and is often found in the background of planted aquariums. It is a rhizomatous species, spreading through runners that root at the nodes, making it easy to propagate. Its compact growth habit and vibrant coloration make it a popular choice for both ornamental and ecological purposes."
