    "intro": "Acaena latebrosa var. brachyphylla, commonly known as the short-stemmed burr bush, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, alternate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright red, spherical fruits that are equipped with hooked bracts, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and is often found in coastal and inland regions. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena latebrosa var. brachyphylla is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the region of Otago. This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky hillsides and gravelly soils. It is well adapted to the temperate and semi-arid climates of its native range. The variety is distinguished by its short, compact growth habit and is part of the brambles family.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena latebrosa var. brachyphylla was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century. The plant was initially planted for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and flowers. However, it has since become an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its rapid growth and seed dispersal have led to its widespread distribution across various habitats in New Zealand."
