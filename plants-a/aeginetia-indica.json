    "intro": "Aeginetia indica, commonly known as the Indian mallow, is a herbaceous plant native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, often accompanied by bracts. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds covered in a sticky, cotton-like substance. Aeginetia indica is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions."
