    "intro": "Anthocephalus macrophyllus, commonly known as the large-leaf anthocephalus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
