    "intro": "Arenaria heterosperma, commonly known as sand sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Arenaria heterosperma is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with limited moisture."
