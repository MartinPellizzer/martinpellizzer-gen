    "intro": "Aristolochia bracteosa, commonly known as the Brazilian pipevine, is a climbing vine native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and striking, pipe-like flowers that are often greenish-white in color. The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals, making it potentially harmful if ingested. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in shaded areas within forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though caution is necessary due to its toxicity."
