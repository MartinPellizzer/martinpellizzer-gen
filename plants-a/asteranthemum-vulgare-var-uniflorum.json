It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant produces opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its flowering period typically occurs during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and containers.
