    "intro": "Agrostis cylindrica, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along streambanks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often hairless, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Agrostis cylindrica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a turfgrass in certain regions."
