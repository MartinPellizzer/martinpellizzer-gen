    "intro": "Alnus oxyacanthifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Betulaceae family, which includes birches and hazelnuts, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Alnus oxyacanthifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky environments."
