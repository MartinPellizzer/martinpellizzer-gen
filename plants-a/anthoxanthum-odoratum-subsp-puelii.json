    "intro": "Anthoxanthum odoratum subsp. puelii, commonly known as the sweet vernal grass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with pink or red at the base. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are clustered in spikelets. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and sandy soils. Its fragrant, honey-scented flowers make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native range."
