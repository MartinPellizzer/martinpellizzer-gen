    "intro": "Amberboa perralderiana, commonly known as the Perralderian amberboa, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant possesses a fibrous root system and produces small, elliptical leaves with a waxy surface. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and requires a sunny to partially shaded environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
