    "intro": "Ascocentrum micranthum, commonly known as the small-flowered arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered around the spadix, which is typically green or yellow in color. Its rhizomes are used as a starchy food source, similar to other arrowroot species. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical forests."
