    "intro": "Allionia coahuilensis, commonly known as Coahuila lily, is a flowering plant native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a short, upright stem. Allionia coahuilensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
