    "intro": "Agrostis sporobolus, commonly known as sandberg bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in open, disturbed areas. Botanically, it is notable for its ability to form rhizomes, which aid in its spread and establishment."
