    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera var. effusa, commonly known as the mat grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and forms a mat-like growth pattern, often covering the ground closely. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
