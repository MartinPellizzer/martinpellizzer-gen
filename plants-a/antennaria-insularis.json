It features small, hairy leaves and produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to rocky and arid environments, often growing on coastal cliffs and dry slopes. Its scientific name reflects its habitat and distinctive appearance, with \"insularis\" referring to its island distribution. Antennaria insularis is valued for its resilience and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
