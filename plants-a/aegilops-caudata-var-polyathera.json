    "intro": "Aegilops caudata var. polyathera, commonly known as the long-haired wild wheat, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive long, feathery glumes that give it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and along roadsides. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This species is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement."
