    "intro": "Astragalus qeydarnabiensis, commonly known as the Qeydarnab Valley milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Turkey. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky and semi-arid habitats, showcasing adaptations to harsh environmental conditions. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to soil stabilization through its deep root system. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially vulnerable species."
