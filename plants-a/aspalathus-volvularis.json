    "intro": "Aspalathus volvularis, commonly known as African red bush, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit and distinctive red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and the plant is drought-tolerant once established. Aspalathus volvularis is also notable for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of caffeine-free tea."
