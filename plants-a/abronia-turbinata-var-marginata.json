    "intro": "Abronia turbinata var. marginata, commonly known as the Margined Sand Verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in sandy or gravelly habitats. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The varietal name 'marginata' refers to the distinctive white or pale margins on its leaves.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abronia turbinata var. marginata is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California, Mexico. This variety is commonly found in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. It thrives in areas with mild, Mediterranean-type climates characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters. The plant is often associated with dune habitats and is well adapted to coastal conditions. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abronia turbinata var. marginata was mainly introduced to coastal areas with sandy soils and moderate maritime climates. It thrives in environments with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. This plant is commonly found in regions such as California and Oregon in the United States. It has been introduced to new areas for ornamental purposes due to its attractive pink and white flowers. However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions where it can outcompete native vegetation."
