    "intro": "Artemisia sparsa, commonly known as slender wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its small, yellowish flowers appear in late summer and are clustered in spherical heads. Artemisia sparsa is often used in traditional medicine and has aromatic properties that make it valuable in ecological and horticultural contexts."
