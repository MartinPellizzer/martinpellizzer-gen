    "intro": "Anarrhinum pechuelii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its blooming period occurs primarily during the spring and early summer, when rainfall is more abundant. Anarrhinum pechuelii is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it a resilient and drought-tolerant species."
