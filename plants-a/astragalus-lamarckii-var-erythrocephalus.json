    "intro": "Astragalus lamarckii var. erythrocephalus, commonly known as the red-headed milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow to orange flowers. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to survive in dry environments by accessing groundwater. Its small, pod-like fruits contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its hardy nature and ecological role in stabilizing soils."
