    "intro": "Amsinckia leibergii, commonly known as the desert tarplant, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that are adapted to arid conditions, and it produces small, elongated seeds in dry, capsule-like structures. Amsinckia leibergii is often found in rocky soils and is considered a member of the Asteraceae family. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest in ecological restoration projects."
