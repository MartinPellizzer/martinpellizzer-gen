    "intro": "Anisophyllum orbiculatum, commonly known as the globe lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms dense, rounded thalli. It is characterized by its leathery, orbicular shape and a dark green to brownish coloration. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions. Its structure consists of a symbiotic association between a photosynthetic algae and a fungal mycelium. Anisophyllum orbiculatum plays a vital role in soil stabilization and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms."
