    "intro": "Astragalus ocrosianus, commonly known as the Peruvian milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow to green flowers that are clustered in racemes, typical of many Astragalus species. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
