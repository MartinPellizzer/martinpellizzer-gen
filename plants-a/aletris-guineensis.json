    "intro": "Aletris guineensis, commonly known as the Guinean false lily, is a flowering plant native to West Africa. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and small, clustered white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Aletris guineensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
