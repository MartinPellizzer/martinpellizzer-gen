    "intro": "Abortopetalum sandwicense, commonly known as the Hawaiian sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the island of Maui in Hawaii. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant features small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the winter months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas or on rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",

It is found specifically on the island of Kauai, where it grows in coastal and lowland habitats. This plant is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of the Hawaiian archipelago. It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and moderate to high humidity. Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abortopetalum sandwicense was mainly introduced to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a species of flowering plant that belongs to the legume family. The plant is native to South America but has been introduced to Hawaii, where it has established itself in certain habitats. It is often found in disturbed areas and along roadsides. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems."
