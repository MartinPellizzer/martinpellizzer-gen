    "intro": "Artemisia copa var. copa, commonly known as mugwort, is a perennial shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features aromatic, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its small, yellowish-green flowers are borne in compact clusters. The plant is characterized by its strong, camphor-like scent, which is due to the presence of volatile oils in its foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens and natural habitats. This species is also valued for its medicinal properties and historical uses in traditional herbal remedies."
