    "intro": "Acidoton virosus, commonly known as the toxic nightshade, is a member of the Solanaceae family. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of purple and white. The plant produces berries that are initially green and turn red as they mature, often mistaken for edible fruits. However, all parts of Acidoton virosus contain toxic alkaloids, making it harmful to both humans and animals. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in woodland edges and waste areas.",
