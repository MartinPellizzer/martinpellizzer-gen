    "intro": "Acer cappadocicum subsp. mayrii, commonly known as the Mayr's maple, is a rare and distinctive species native to the mountainous regions of Turkey. It is characterized by its unique foliage, featuring palmately lobed leaves with a striking combination of green and red hues. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers a sunny to partially shaded environment. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range.",

This subspecies is found in the mountainous areas of Cappadocia, which is known for its unique geological formations and biodiversity. It thrives in rocky and limestone soils, often growing in open woodlands and shrublands. The plant is adapted to the dry and semi-arid climate of its native habitat. Its distribution is relatively restricted, making it a rare and endemic species in the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer cappadocicum subsp. mayrii was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and urban environments where its vibrant autumn colors enhance visual appeal. The subspecies is favored for its compact growth habit and resistance to common pests and diseases. Although it is not native to North America, it has been widely distributed across the continent as a cultivated plant. Its introduction has led to its presence in several regions where it is grown for aesthetic purposes."
