    "intro": "Aconitum laeve, commonly known as the smooth aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense, spikelike clusters at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately divided and have a distinctive, waxy texture. Aconitum laeve contains potent toxins, including aconitine, making it highly poisonous to both humans and animals.",
