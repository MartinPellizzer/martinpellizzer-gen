    "intro": "Asplenium polyphyleticum, commonly known as the polyphyletic shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its small, densely packed fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spores in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its complex taxonomy, it is considered polyphyletic, meaning it includes species with a common ancestor but not all descendants."
