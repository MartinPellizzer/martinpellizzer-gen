    "intro": "Astragalus agrestis, commonly known as the field milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus agrestis is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
