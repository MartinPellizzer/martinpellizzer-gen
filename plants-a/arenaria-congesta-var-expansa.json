    "intro": "Arenaria congesta var. expansa, commonly known as the broad-leaved sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces clusters of small, pink or violet flowers. The leaves are typically broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and coastal dunes. This plant is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
