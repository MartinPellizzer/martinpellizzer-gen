    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abuta oblonga var. angustifolia was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and partial to full sun exposure. It thrives in temperate climates and is commonly found in regions with moderate rainfall. This variant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique growth habit. It is also valued for its potential medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices. However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native environments."
