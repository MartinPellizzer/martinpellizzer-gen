    "intro": "Asplenium loriceum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a compact, clumping growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium loriceum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
