    "intro": "Adesmia filipes var. obtusifolia, commonly known as the blunt-leafed adesmia, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine pubescence, providing some drought tolerance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers during the warmer months, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand periods of drought. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in degraded landscapes.",
