    "intro": "Arctium leptocephalum, commonly known as lesser burdock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a robust, upright stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, covered with rough, glandular hairs. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves that are lobed and have a fuzzy texture. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in dense, spiky heads, which are characteristic of the Asteraceae family. The plant is known for its distinctive, woody, bur-like fruits that contain seeds with hooked bracts, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing."
