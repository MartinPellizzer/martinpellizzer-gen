    "intro": "Artemisia nitrosa var. gobica, commonly known as the Gobica wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage composed of narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are typically clustered in dense, spherical shapes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for dry, rocky environments. Its essential oils contain compounds like thujone and camphor, which contribute to its medicinal and aromatic properties."
