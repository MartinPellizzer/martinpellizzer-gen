    "intro": "Acalypha welwitschiana, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf mallow, is a flowering plant native to tropical and southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces showy, pinkish-red bracts that surround its small, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Acalypha welwitschiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.",

This species is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often seen in woodland areas or along riverbanks. The plant is known for its striking foliage and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of sub-Saharan Africa.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha welwitschiana was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage. It is commonly found in areas with warm climates, including parts of the Caribbean, southern Florida, and Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun exposure. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative means have led to its establishment in some non-native environments. However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it is cultivated."
