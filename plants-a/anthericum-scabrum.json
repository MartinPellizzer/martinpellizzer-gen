    "intro": "Anthericum scabrum, commonly known as rough dog's-tongue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence structure consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and covered in a rough, scabrous texture, giving it its common name. The spadix produces small, greenish flowers that are often hidden beneath the spathe, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
