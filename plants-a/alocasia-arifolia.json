It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with striking white veins against a deep green background. The plant belongs to the Araceae family, which includes other ornamental plants like peace lilies and calla lilies. Alocasia arifolia thrives in humid, shady environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
