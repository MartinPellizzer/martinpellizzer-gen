    "intro": "Aristida peregrina, commonly known as the wandering grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, often forming dense mats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Aristida peregrina plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
