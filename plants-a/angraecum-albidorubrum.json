    "intro": "Angraecum albidorubrum, commonly known as the red-tinged orchid, is a species of orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically white with reddish or pinkish tinges. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other structures without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are often fragrant and are pollinated by specific nocturnal moths. Angraecum albidorubrum is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat."
