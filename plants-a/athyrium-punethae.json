    "intro": "Athyrium punethae, commonly known as the Himalayan maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of India and Nepal. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly glossy surface. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest areas at high altitudes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Athyrium punethae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
