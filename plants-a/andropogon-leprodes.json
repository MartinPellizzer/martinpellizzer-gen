    "intro": "Andropogon leprodes, commonly known as the slender bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments. Andropogon leprodes plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
