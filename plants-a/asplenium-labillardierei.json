    "intro": "Asplenium labillardierei, commonly known as the rock spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to Australia. It typically grows on rocky substrates, particularly in coastal and subcoastal regions. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with closely spaced, lanceolate leaves. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. Asplenium labillardierei is well adapted to low-light and saline environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
