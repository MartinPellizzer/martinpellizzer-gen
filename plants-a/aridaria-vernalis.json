    "intro": "Aridaria vernalis, commonly known as the spring desert sage, is a flowering plant adapted to arid environments. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically during the first rains of the season. The plant has deep, fibrous roots that help it survive in dry conditions by accessing underground water sources. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss through transpiration. Aridaria vernalis is often found in rocky soils and is an important plant for pollinators in its native habitat."
