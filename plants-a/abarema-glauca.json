    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abarema glauca is primarily native to South America, specifically Brazil. It is commonly found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which spans across eastern Brazil. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is often associated with secondary growth areas and can be found in both natural and disturbed habitats. Abarema glauca is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native environment.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema glauca was mainly introduced to control erosion and for ornamental purposes in tropical and subtropical regions. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is native to South America but has been introduced to several countries in Africa and Southeast Asia. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in some ecosystems. Despite its benefits, careful management is required to prevent it from becoming a weed."
