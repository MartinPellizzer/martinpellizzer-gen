    "intro": "Acacia pilligaensis, commonly known as the Pilliga acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Pilliga Forest in New South Wales, Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and bipinnate leaves that are finely divided. The plant produces yellow, globular flowers that appear in late winter to early spring, followed by flat, woody pods containing seeds. It is adapted to dry, open habitats and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. Acacia pilligaensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",

It is found in the inland regions of the state, particularly in the Pilliga Forest and surrounding areas. This species thrives in dry, open woodlands and sandy soils. It is an important component of the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and threatened species in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia pilligaensis was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or loamy soils in semi-arid regions. It thrives in environments with low rainfall and high temperatures. This plant is commonly found in parts of Queensland and New South Wales in Australia. It is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber. Its introduction has had both ecological and economic impacts in the regions where it is established."
