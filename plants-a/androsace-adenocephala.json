    "intro": "Androsace adenocephala, commonly known as the woolly mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features a compact rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender stems above the foliage. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions."
