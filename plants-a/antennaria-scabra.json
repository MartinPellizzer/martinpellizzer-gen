    "intro": "Antennaria scabra, commonly known as the rough mouse-eared cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. Its stems are usually hairless and can become woody with age, while its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, stiff hairs. Antennaria scabra is well adapted to cold, rocky environments and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats."
