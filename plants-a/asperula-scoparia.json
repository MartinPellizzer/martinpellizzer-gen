    "intro": "Asperula scoparia, commonly known as the creeping azalea, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring. Asperula scoparia thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a valuable addition to native plant collections."
