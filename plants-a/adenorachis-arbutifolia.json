    "intro": "Adenorachis arbutifolia, commonly known as the shrub-leaf hakea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Proteaceae. It is native to south-western Australia, where it typically grows in dry, sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, leathery leaves that are often arranged in clusters. It produces yellow to orange flowers in summer, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. Adenorachis arbutifolia is adapted to fire-prone environments and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat.",
