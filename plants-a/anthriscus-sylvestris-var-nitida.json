    "intro": "Anthriscus sylvestris var. nitida, commonly known as hairy cow parsley, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant produces small, white umbels of flowers in early to mid-summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded to partially shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a native, low-maintenance plant."
