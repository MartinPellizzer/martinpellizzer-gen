    "intro": "Arundo donax, commonly known as giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Arundo donax is highly adaptable, thriving in a variety of soil types and climates, making it a common invasive species in wetlands and disturbed areas. Its rapid growth and high biomass make it both a useful resource and a potential ecological threat."
