    "intro": "Andinopuntia lagopus subsp. septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern sky cactus, is a succulent plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are modified into spines, providing protection from herbivores. This subspecies is well adapted to high-altitude environments with strong sunlight and cold temperatures."
