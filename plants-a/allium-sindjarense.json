    "intro": "Allium sindjarense, commonly known as the Sindjaren onion, is a rare species native to the high altitudes of the eastern Himalayas. It is a bulbous plant with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale purple flowers in clusters. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Its bulbs are often used in traditional medicine and local cuisines. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts."
