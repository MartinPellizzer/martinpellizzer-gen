    "intro": "Amyris floridana, commonly known as the Florida sand-amyris, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in terminal panicles. Its woody structure and ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils make it well adapted to coastal and scrub habitats. Amyris floridana is often found in dry, open woodlands and is a valuable component of native plant communities."
