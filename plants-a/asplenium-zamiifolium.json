    "intro": "Asplenium zamiifolium, commonly known as the holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble holly leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, dark brown to black coating, which helps in moisture retention. Asplenium zamiifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its unique foliage."
