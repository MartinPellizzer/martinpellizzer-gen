    "intro": "Artemisia rupestris subsp. viridis, commonly known as green rabbitbrush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, gray-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of aromatic hairs. The plant produces small yellow flowers arranged in composite heads, which are typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid and semi-arid environments. Its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil make it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
