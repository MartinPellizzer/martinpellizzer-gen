    "intro": "Aster fremontii, commonly known as the Fremont's aster, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. It produces showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is generally gray-green, with narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry habitat."
