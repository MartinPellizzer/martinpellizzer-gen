    "intro": "Aster latibracteatus, commonly known as the broad-bract aster, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and ray florets. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes and swamps. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its flowers bloom in late summer to early fall. The broad bracts that surround the flower head give it its common name and contribute to its ornamental appeal."
