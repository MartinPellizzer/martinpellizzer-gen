    "intro": "Acrostichum erythrodes, commonly known as the red-stemmed brake fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds with a reddish hue on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it plays a role in soil stabilization in its native habitat. The fronds are pinnately compound, with lance-shaped pinnae that are closely spaced and have a serrated margin.",
