    "intro": "Anemone narcissiflora var. sachaliensis, commonly known as the Sachalin anemone, is a perennial herb native to the Russian Far East and parts of northeastern China. It features showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically basal and arranged in a rosette. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to naturalize in suitable climates."
