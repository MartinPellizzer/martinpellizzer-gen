It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus perpexus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations."
