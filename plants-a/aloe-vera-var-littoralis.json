    "intro": "Aloe vera var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal aloe, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer. It is adapted to grow in sandy, well-drained soils and can tolerate salt spray from the ocean. Due to its hardiness, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in coastal gardens."
