    "intro": "Anthurium rubricaule, commonly known as the red-stem anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a reddish or purplish hue along the midrib. The plant produces vibrant, spadix-shaped inflorescences that are often surrounded by a colorful spathe, which can range from white to red. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium rubricaule is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and ability to purify indoor air."
