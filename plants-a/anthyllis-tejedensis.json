    "intro": "Anthyllis tejedensis, commonly known as the Spanish broom, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and North Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its yellow, pea-like flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid conditions. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Anthyllis tejedensis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators."
