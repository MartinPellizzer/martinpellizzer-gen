    "intro": "Aristolochia geminiflora, commonly known as the twin-flowered Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, saddle-shaped leaves and its unique, intricate flowers that resemble a pipe with a narrow opening. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in pairs, giving it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. The genus Aristolochia includes many species with similar morphological features and some with medicinal or toxic properties."
