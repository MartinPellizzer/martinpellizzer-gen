    "intro": "Artocarpus elongatus, commonly known as the long-fruit breadfruit, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its large, elongated fruits that resemble breadfruit but are typically smaller. The tree produces compound leaves and has a rough, bark-like trunk. Its fruit is edible when ripe, with a texture similar to breadfruit and a sweet, nutty flavor. The plant is valued for both its fruit and its potential ecological and economic importance in its native regions."
