    "intro": "Asplenium radicans var. crenatum, commonly known as the creeping spleenwort, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant that typically grows on rocks or tree trunks. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a serrated margin, which is characteristic of the varietal name *crenatum*. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize surfaces effectively. The fronds are usually dark green and can form dense mats, contributing to its ornamental value in shaded environments."
