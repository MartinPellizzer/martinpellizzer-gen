    "intro": "Arctophila remotiflora, commonly known as the remote-flowered arctic bell, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in open, sunny habitats. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is adapted to cold climates with a short growing season. Arctophila remotiflora is an important component of alpine ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
