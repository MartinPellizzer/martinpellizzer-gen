It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in desert and rocky habitats. It is part of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and has a strong, distinctive scent due to its high concentration of essential oils.
