    "intro": "Aspidium paraense, commonly known as the Brazilian water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to South America. It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically submerged, with some leaves emerging above the water surface. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize sediments and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Aspidium paraense plays a role in water filtration and is sometimes used in phytoremediation efforts."
