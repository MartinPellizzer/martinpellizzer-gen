    "intro": "Amphidoxa glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the stems are usually branched and floating. Amphidoxa glandulosa is a carnivorous plant that relies on both photosynthesis and the capture of prey for survival."
