    "intro": "Acer davidii var. acuminatifolium, commonly known as the pointed-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are finely serrated and turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and parks.",

It thrives in cool, humid climates at high altitudes, often found in forests and along stream banks. This variant is known for its distinctive pointed leaves and is adapted to the rugged terrain of these areas. It is a member of the maple family and is valued for its ornamental qualities. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer davidii var. acuminatifolium was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and unique leaf shape. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its aesthetic value. This variety is particularly valued for its bright green leaves that turn vibrant red or orange in the fall. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is not commonly found in the wild and is primarily grown in cultivation."
