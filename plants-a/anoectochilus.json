    "intro": "Anoectochilus, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a genus of epiphytic orchids native to Southeast Asia. These plants are characterized by their small, often pale or translucent leaves and their striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, or purple. Anoectochilus species are known for their unique growth habit, often growing on tree trunks or branches without soil. They require specific environmental conditions, including high humidity and indirect light, to thrive. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, many species within this genus are threatened with extinction."
