    "intro": "Astragalus mendax, commonly known as the false milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in early summer. Its seed pods are slender and elongated, containing several small, kidney-shaped seeds. Astragalus mendax is known for its ability to thrive in arid environments and is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness."
