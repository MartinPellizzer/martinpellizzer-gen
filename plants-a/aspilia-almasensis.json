    "intro": "Aspilia almasensis, commonly known as the Almas's torchflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its striking, spiky floral structure. The plant produces bright yellow to orange capitula, which are composed of numerous small florets arranged in a dense, torch-like shape. Aspilia almasensis is adapted to survive in dry environments, with hairy leaves that reduce water loss and deep root systems for accessing groundwater. Its unique appearance and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in its native habitat."
