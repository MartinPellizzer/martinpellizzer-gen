    "intro": "Agropyron nodosum, commonly known as prairie grass or nodding brome, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and spikelets that nod toward the ground, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, disturbed soils, and roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and bluish-green, and it produces small, brownish seeds in compact clusters. Agropyron nodosum is adapted to withstand drought and is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological resilience."
