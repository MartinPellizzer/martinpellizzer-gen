    "intro": "Aloe acinacifolia var. nitens, commonly known as the sword aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, covered in a whitish powdery coating called farina. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with ample sunlight. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
