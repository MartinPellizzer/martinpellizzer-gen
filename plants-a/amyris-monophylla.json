    "intro": "Amyris monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf amyris, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and its distinctive, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically clustered at the ends of its branches. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by dark, leathery fruits containing numerous seeds. Amyris monophylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its use in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
