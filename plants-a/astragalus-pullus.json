    "intro": "Astragalus pullus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairie and steppe habitats. Astragalus pullus has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread across open landscapes."
