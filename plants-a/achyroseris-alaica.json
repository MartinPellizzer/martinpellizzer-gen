    "intro": "Achyroseris alaica, commonly known as the Hawaiian dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky areas and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of Hawaii. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",
