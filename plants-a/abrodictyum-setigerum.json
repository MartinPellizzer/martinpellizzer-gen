    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abrodictyum setigerum is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa. It is found in regions such as the Eastern Cape, Western Cape, and the Free State. This plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils in open habitats like grasslands and fynbos areas. It is commonly associated with coastal and inland regions where the climate is temperate to semi-arid. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrodictyum setigerum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was primarily brought in for its ornamental value due to its attractive, sword-shaped leaves. The plant has since spread to other areas, including parts of California and Oregon. It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks and in forest understories. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
