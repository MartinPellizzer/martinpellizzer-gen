    "intro": "Aristolochia macroura, commonly known as the large-flowered Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, maroon-colored flowers that resemble a pipe, which are typically pollinated by flies. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves and can grow up to 15 meters in length. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The genus Aristolochia contains several species with similar morphological features, but A. macroura is notable for its large, showy blooms."
