    "intro": "Aegilops mutica var. muruni, commonly known as the rough wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Eurasia. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. The species is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for improving wheat varieties through genetic crosses."
