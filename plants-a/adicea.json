    "intro": "Adicea, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Araceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. The plants typically have large, showy leaves and produce inflorescences that resemble umbels, which are characteristic of the Araceae family. Adicea species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. However, some species are toxic and should be handled with care."
