    "intro": "Atylosia grandiflora, commonly known as the Mexican blanket flower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Atylosia grandiflora is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and vibrant floral display."
