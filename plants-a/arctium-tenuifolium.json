It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant features heart-shaped, lobed leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. Its flowers are yellow and are arranged in clusters, producing small, spiky fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Lesser burdock is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
