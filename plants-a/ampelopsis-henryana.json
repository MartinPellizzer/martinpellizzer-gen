    "intro": "Ampelopsis henryana, commonly known as the Chinese ivy, is a climbing vine native to China. It features heart-shaped, glossy dark green leaves that are often tinged with purple on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Its vigorous growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in shaded gardens."
