It typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes and riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, hairy texture. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its botanical features make it adaptable to wetland habitats and useful for ecological restoration projects."
