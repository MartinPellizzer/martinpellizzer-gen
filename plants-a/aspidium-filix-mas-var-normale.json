    "intro": "Aspidium filix-mas var. normale, commonly known as the common water fern, is a perennial fern native to various regions across Asia and Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that arise from a creeping rhizome. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp forests. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
