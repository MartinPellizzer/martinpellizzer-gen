    "intro": "Abrotanum pulverulentum, commonly known as the dusty abrotanum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been historically used in traditional herbal remedies.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abrotanum pulverulentum is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It thrives in dry, rocky, and coastal environments, often found in areas with limited rainfall. This plant is commonly associated with Mediterranean scrublands and maquis vegetation. It is well adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its distribution is closely linked to the specific climatic and geological conditions of the Mediterranean Basin.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrotanum pulverulentum was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in states like California and Nevada. It was brought in as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance. However, it has since become an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its spread is often facilitated by its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its production of\u5927\u91cf lightweight seeds. Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and prevent further ecological disruption."
