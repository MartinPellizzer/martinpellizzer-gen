    "intro": "Argan, commonly known as the argan tree, is a species native to the arid regions of Morocco. It is a small, deciduous tree that produces small, yellowish flowers and hard, woody fruits. The fruit contains a single seed surrounded by a fatty, orange-colored pulp. The tree is well adapted to harsh, dry climates and has deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil conditions. Its unique botanical features make it an important part of the local ecosystem and traditional agriculture."
