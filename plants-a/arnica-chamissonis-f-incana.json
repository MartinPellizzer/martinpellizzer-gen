    "intro": "Arnica chamissonis f. incana, commonly known as the woolly arnica, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its hairy leaves and stems are adaptations to cold, high-altitude environments, helping to reduce water loss. The plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its applications are limited due to its toxicity."
