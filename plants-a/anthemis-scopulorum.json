    "intro": "Anthemis scopulorum, commonly known as the rock anthemis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its foliage consists of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a decorative plant in dry landscapes."
