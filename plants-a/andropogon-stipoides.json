    "intro": "Andropogon stipoides, commonly known as switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. Switchgrass thrives in a variety of soil types and is highly drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for native plant gardens and restoration projects. It produces panicles of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ecological value by providing food for birds and insects. This plant is also recognized for its potential as a bioenergy crop due to its high biomass yield and adaptability."
