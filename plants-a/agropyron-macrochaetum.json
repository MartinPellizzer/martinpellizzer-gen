    "intro": "Agropyron macrochaetum, commonly known as the tall wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the colder regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and long, slender leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers. Agropyron macrochaetum is well adapted to harsh environments, including alpine and arctic regions, due to its cold tolerance and drought resistance. It is often used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage crop for livestock."
