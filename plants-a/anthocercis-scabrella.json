    "intro": "Anthocercis scabrella, commonly known as the rough-hair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its elongated, arching fronds that are covered in rough, scaly textures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Anthocercis scabrella is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in woodland ecosystems."
