    "intro": "Astragalus reventus var. canbyi, commonly known as Canby's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as slopes and plains, and is adapted to arid conditions. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
