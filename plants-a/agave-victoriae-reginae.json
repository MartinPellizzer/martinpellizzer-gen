    "intro": "Agave victoriae-reginae, commonly known as the Queen of the Night, is a striking member of the Agavaceae family native to the highlands of central Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem and rosette of long, blue-green, fibrous leaves that are often lined with white or grayish teeth. The plant produces a single, massive inflorescence that blooms only at night, emitting a strong fragrance to attract pollinators. Its striking appearance and unique blooming habit make it a popular ornamental plant. Due to its slow growth and specific care requirements, it is often cultivated in arid or semi-arid environments."
