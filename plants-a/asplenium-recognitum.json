    "intro": "Asplenium recognitum, commonly known as the common rock fern, is a small evergreen fern native to Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky crevices and shaded areas, thriving in moist, humid conditions. The plant has dark green, leathery fronds that are often curled or twisted, with a distinctive, compact growth habit. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a single row along the veins. Asplenium recognitum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate low light conditions."
