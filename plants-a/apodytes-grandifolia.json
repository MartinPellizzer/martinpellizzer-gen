    "intro": "Apodytes grandifolia, commonly known as the African snowball, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in winter. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions."
