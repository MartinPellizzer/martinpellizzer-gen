    "intro": "Algarobia juliflora, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring woody stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring and are followed by small, round, yellow fruits. Algarobia juliflora is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in dry conditions. It is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment in degraded landscapes."
