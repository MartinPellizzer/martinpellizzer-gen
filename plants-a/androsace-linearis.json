    "intro": "Androsace linearis, commonly known as the slender rockjelly, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to alpine landscapes. Androsace linearis is often cultivated in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and hardy nature."
