This variety is found in the southern regions of New Zealand, including the South Island. It typically grows in coastal areas and disturbed ground. The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate of this region. It is often seen in open habitats such as beaches, dunes, and rocky outcrops.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena microphylla var. robusta was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature. The distribution of this plant has expanded beyond its original introduction, leading to its presence in various regions of New Zealand. It is now found in both coastal and inland areas, often thriving in disturbed soils. However, its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems."
