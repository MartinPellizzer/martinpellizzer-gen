It is characterized by its unique, deeply lobed leaves that often have a textured, rugose surface. This variant is typically found in specific forested habitats in eastern North America. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and is adapted to moist, well-drained soils. Its ornamental value has made it a subject of interest for horticulturists and botanists alike.",
