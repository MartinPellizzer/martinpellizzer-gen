    "intro": "Acer glabrum var. siskiyouense, commonly known as the Siskiyou maple, is a rare and endemic species native to the Siskiyou Mountains of Oregon and California. It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree with smooth, gray bark and palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cool, temperate climate of its native range. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.",
