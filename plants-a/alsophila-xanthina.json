    "intro": "Alsophila xanthina, commonly known as the golden tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive golden hue on its young fronds, which fades as they mature. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in forest understories. Alsophila xanthina plays a role in providing habitat and shelter for various small organisms in its native ecosystem."
