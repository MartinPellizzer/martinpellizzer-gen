It is characterized by its narrow, evergreen leaves that are typically arranged in whorls along the stems. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, wooded areas. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and landscape gardening."
