    "intro": "Adiantum pedatum, commonly known as the miter fern, is a delicate, shade-loving fern native to North America. It features a unique, upright frond structure with fern-like leaves that are finely divided and feather-shaped. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Adiantum pedatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in shady garden settings.",
