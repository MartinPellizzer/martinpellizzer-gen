    "intro": "Alsophila fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery fronds. The plant has a distinctive, fragrant scent that becomes more pronounced when the fronds are cut or bruised. Its rhizome system supports the growth of its tall, unbranched trunk, while the fronds are arranged in a compact, umbrella-like shape. Alsophila fragrans is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal and unique fragrance."
