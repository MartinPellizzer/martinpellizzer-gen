    "intro": "Astragalus transiliensis var. microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, compound leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces yellow or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
