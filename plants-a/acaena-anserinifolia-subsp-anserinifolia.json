    "intro": "Acaena anserinifolia subsp. anserinifolia, commonly known as the silverweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, hair-like trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by spherical, dry fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its growth habit includes a low, spreading form with numerous stolons, making it well adapted to its native environment.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena anserinifolia subsp. anserinifolia is primarily native to the Chatham Islands, New Zealand North, and New Zealand South. This species is found in the coastal and subcoastal regions of these areas. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines. The plant is well adapted to the harsh maritime climate of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena anserinifolia subsp. anserinifolia was mainly introduced to Antipodean Is., Great Britain, and Ireland. It was likely brought there for ornamental purposes due to its distinctive silver foliage and compact growth habit. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for garden landscapes in these regions. However, it has shown invasive tendencies in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact."
