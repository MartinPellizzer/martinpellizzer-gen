This plant thrives in rocky and semi-arid environments. It is commonly found in open grasslands and along rocky outcrops. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within Ethiopia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus sennii was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. It is commonly found in coastal areas and rocky habitats due to its tolerance for saline and well-drained soils. This plant has been introduced to various parts of the world as an ornamental species because of its attractive, palmate leaves and showy spikes of blue or purple flowers. It is often cultivated in gardens and public spaces for its aesthetic value. However, in some regions, it has become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation."
