    "intro": "Asparagus pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf asparagus or miniature asparagus, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features small, fern-like leaves that are typically bright green and emit a subtle, pleasant aroma. The plant produces tiny, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, edible berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is often grown in gardens and as a houseplant."
