    "intro": "Astragalus suberosus subsp. ancyleus, commonly known as the rough milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry climates with minimal water availability. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. This subspecies is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of these environments."
