It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often described as lace-like in appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are bioluminescent under certain conditions, which is a rare trait among ferns. Adiantum lindsaea is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.",
