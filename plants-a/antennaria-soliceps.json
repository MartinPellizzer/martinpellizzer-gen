    "intro": "Antennaria soliceps, commonly known as the slender mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy stems and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Antennaria soliceps plays a role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme climates."
