    "intro": "Althaea hirsuta, commonly known as the woolly marshmallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its flowers are typically clustered in racemes, and the plant can grow up to 1 meter in height. Althaea hirsuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its mucilage-rich roots."
