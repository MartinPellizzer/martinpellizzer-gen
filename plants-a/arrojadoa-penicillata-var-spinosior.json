    "intro": "Arrojadoa penicillata var. spinosior, commonly known as the spiny arrojadoa, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and woody stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are typically opposite, elliptic in shape, and have a leathery texture. The spiny features of this plant serve as a natural defense mechanism against herbivores."
