    "intro": "Asterochlaena orbicularis var. decumbens, commonly known as the creeping sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically orbicular in shape, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a cluster, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping."
