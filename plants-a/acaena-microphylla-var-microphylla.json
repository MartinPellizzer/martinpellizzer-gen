    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena microphylla var. microphylla is primarily native to New Zealand North and New Zealand South. This species is commonly found in various habitats across both regions, including grasslands, shrublands, and coastal areas. It thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with nutrient-poor soils. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native range, supporting local wildlife and contributing to soil stability. Its distribution is largely restricted to the islands of New Zealand, where it has adapted to the unique environmental conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena microphylla var. microphylla was mainly introduced to Czechia-Slovakia as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas, where it is cultivated for its aesthetic value. However, it has the potential to become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly. The plant's spread is often associated with human activity, such as gardening and landscaping practices. Its introduction has raised concerns among local conservationists due to its potential ecological impact."
