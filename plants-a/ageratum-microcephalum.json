It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows to a height of about 15 to 30 centimeters and prefers well-drained soil and full sun. Its foliage is usually gray-green with a slightly fuzzy texture, and it is often used in ornamental gardening for its decorative appeal. Ageratum microcephalum is also valued for its ability to attract beneficial insects like ladybugs and lacewings."
