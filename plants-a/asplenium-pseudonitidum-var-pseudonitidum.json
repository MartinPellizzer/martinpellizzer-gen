    "intro": "Asplenium pseudonitidum var. pseudonitidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new shoots. Its leaves are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and the sporangia are borne on the undersides of the fronds. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
