    "intro": "Asplenium trichomanes subsp. humistratum, commonly known as the mossy spleenwort, is a fern species belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are clustered on the underside of its leaves. This subspecies is notable for its ability to tolerate humid conditions, making it a common sight in forest understories."
