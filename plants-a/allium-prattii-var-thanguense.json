It features slender, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, and it produces clusters of small, pale purple to white flowers in the summer. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, onion-like flavor, making it a useful crop in certain regions. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh climates."
