    "intro": "Asplenium dissectum, commonly known as the cut-leaf spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant features delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium dissectum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
