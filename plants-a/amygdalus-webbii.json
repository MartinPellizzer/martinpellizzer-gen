    "intro": "Amygdalus webbii, commonly known as the Webb's almond, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, edible almonds, though they are generally not as widely cultivated as other almond varieties. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, while its bark is smooth and grayish in color. Amygdalus webbii is often grown for its ornamental value and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
