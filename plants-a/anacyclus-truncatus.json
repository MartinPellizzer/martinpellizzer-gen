It is a low-growing perennial herb with a fibrous root system and a rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers with a distinctive central disk and ray florets, blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Anacyclus truncatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
