    "intro": "Andryala arenaria var. pinnatifida, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or violet, blooming during the warmer months. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
