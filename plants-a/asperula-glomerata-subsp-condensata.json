It features small, fragrant, white to pale blue flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three ovate to elliptic leaflets with hairy surfaces. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland and streamside habitats.
