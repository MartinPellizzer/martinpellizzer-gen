    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria subsp. alpestris, commonly known as the Alpine woundwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in dry, rocky, and alpine environments, often found in meadows and slopes at high altitudes. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This subspecies is notable for its ability to colonize disturbed soils and its ecological importance in alpine ecosystems."
