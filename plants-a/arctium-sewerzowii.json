    "intro": "Arctium sewerzowii, commonly known as the Siberian burdock, is a perennial herb native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces spiny, bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in a variety of soil types, including those that are dry or disturbed. Arctium sewerzowii is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
