    "intro": "Alnus ovalifolia, commonly known as the ovalleaf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Betulaceae family, which includes birches, hazels, and alders. The plant is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves that are alternate along the stems and often have a serrated edge. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by woody fruits that disperse its seeds. Alnus ovalifolia is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in moist, temperate climates."
