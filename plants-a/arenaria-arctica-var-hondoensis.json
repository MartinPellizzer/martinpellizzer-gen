    "intro": "Arenaria arctica var. hondoensis, commonly known as the Hondo sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It typically features dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra or rocky habitats. This variety is notable for its resilience to extreme climates and its role in stabilizing soil in polar ecosystems."
