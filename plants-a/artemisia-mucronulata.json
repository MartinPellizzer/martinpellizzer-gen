    "intro": "Artemisia mucronulata, commonly known as narrow-lobed wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late summer. The plant produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds and is often found in rocky or arid environments. It has a strong, pungent odor due to the presence of essential oils in its leaves. Artemisia mucronulata is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
