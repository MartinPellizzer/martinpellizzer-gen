    "intro": "Acacia alexandri, commonly known as the Alexandrian acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often thornless stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, oval leaflets. The plant produces yellow globular flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Acacia alexandri thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and rocky habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes.",
