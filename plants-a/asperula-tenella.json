    "intro": "Asperula tenella, commonly known as the creeping azalea, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It features dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, blooming in early spring. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are oval in shape and arranged oppositely along the stems. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a valued addition to both natural and cultivated landscapes."
