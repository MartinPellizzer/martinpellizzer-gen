    "intro": "Astragalus missouriensis f. leucophaeus, commonly known as the Missouri milkvetch, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to the central United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish to reddish flowers. The plant is typically found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it an important subject for botanical study and conservation efforts. This variety is distinguished by its pale or white flower color, which sets it apart from other forms of Astragalus missouriensis."
