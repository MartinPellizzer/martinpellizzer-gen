    "intro": "Andropogon lindenii, commonly known as Lindensedge, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a terminal spike that produces small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Lindensedge plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
