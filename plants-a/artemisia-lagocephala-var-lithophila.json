    "intro": "Artemisia lagocephala var. lithophila, commonly known as the rock wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found growing on limestone outcrops. Its essential oils, which contain compounds like thujone and camphor, contribute to its strong scent and medicinal uses. It is well adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
