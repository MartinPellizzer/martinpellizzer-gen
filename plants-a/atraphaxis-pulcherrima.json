    "intro": "Atraphaxis pulcherrima, commonly known as the desert star or fireplant, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapted to survive in dry environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its stem is woody and often branched, with a tendency to form dense clusters. Atraphaxis pulcherrima is drought-tolerant and requires minimal care, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
