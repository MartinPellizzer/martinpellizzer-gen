    "intro": "Aragoa occidentalis, commonly known as the western aragoa, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapting to the arid conditions of its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Aragoa occidentalis is considered a vulnerable species."
