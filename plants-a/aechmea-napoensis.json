    "intro": "Aechmea napoensis, commonly known as the Napo bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaf structure that collects water, providing a microhabitat for various organisms. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are typically broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Aechmea napoensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of tropical forests."
