    "intro": "Arthrosia malachantha, commonly known as the coral-root orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph that relies entirely on fungal networks for nutrients. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or white in color, often resembling coral in appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments within forests, often growing on the forest floor or as an epiphyte. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
