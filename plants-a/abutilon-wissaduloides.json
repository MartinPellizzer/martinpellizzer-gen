    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon wissaduloides is primarily native to the Caribbean region, including parts of the Greater and Lesser Antilles. It is found in countries such as Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico. This plant typically grows in moist, tropical environments, often near rivers or in coastal areas. It is commonly associated with disturbed habitats and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. Its native range is limited to these specific islands, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon wissaduloides was mainly introduced to urban and suburban areas for its ornamental value. It is commonly found along roadsides, in gardens, and near water sources. The plant thrives in warm climates and is often used in landscaping due to its attractive foliage and flowers. It has become naturalized in several regions, sometimes outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems."
