    "intro": "Acacia procera, commonly known as the umbrella thorn acacia, is a tall, woody shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its long, straight thorns and compound leaves that are often reduced to small, needle-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. Acacia procera is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. It plays an important role in providing shade and habitat in its native ecosystems.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia procera is primarily native to the Horn of Africa, including countries such as Somalia, Ethiopia, and Eritrea. It is also found in parts of the Arabian Peninsula, including Yemen and Oman. This tree thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in savannas and rocky landscapes. It is well adapted to dry climates and can tolerate poor soil conditions. Acacia procera is an important component of the local ecosystem and has cultural and economic significance in the regions where it is found.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia procera was mainly introduced to regions with arid or semi-arid climates due to its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions. It is commonly found in savannas and dry woodlands, where it thrives in well-drained soils. This plant is valued for its hardiness, ability to fix nitrogen, and use in traditional medicine and as a source of timber. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological impacts, including competition with native species. Acacia procera is also used in reforestation projects to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
