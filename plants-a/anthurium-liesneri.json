    "intro": "Anthurium liesneri, commonly known as the velvet anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety texture. The plant produces vibrant, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by colorful spathe, which can range from red to orange. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium liesneri is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and ability to purify indoor air."
