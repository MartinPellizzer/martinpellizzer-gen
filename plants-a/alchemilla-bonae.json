    "intro": "Alchemilla bonae, commonly known as the lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces distinctive, cup-shaped bracts that enclose its flowers, giving it a unique appearance. Alchemilla bonae thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help retain moisture and protect against herbivory."
