    "intro": "Angolluma baldratii, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage and clusters of delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular specimen in botanical gardens and among plant enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several countries."
