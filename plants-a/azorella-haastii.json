    "intro": "Azorella haastii, commonly known as the Haast's cushion plant, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family, native to the high-altitude regions of South America. This plant forms dense, low-growing cushions or mats, often covering large areas in alpine environments. Its leaves are typically small, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in harsh conditions. Azorella haastii is adapted to cold, dry climates and can survive extreme temperature fluctuations. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other alpine species."
