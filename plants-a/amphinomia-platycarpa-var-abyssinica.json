    "intro": "Amphinomia platycarpa var. abyssinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian boxwood, is a shrub native to the highland regions of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are typically oval in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its evergreen foliage and ability to tolerate a variety of soil conditions. However, it requires well-drained soil and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
