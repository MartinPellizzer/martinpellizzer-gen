    "intro": "Asplenium asterolepis, commonly known as the star-leaf spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that belongs to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, star-shaped scales. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or tree trunks in temperate regions. Its rhizomes are short and often form compact, cushion-like colonies. The fronds are usually dark green and may have a slightly waxy texture, contributing to its ability to retain moisture."
