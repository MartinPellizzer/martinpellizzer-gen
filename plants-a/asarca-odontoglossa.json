    "intro": "Asarca odontoglossa, commonly known as the toothed tongue fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, toothed fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are usually narrow and elongated, with a leathery texture and a deep green color. Asarca odontoglossa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and air-purifying properties."
