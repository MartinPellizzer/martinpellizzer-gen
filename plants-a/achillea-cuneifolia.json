    "intro": "Achillea cuneifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf yarrow, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, grass-like leaves and flat clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky, or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it useful in erosion control.",
