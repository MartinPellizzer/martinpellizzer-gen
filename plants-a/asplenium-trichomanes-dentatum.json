    "intro": "Asplenium trichomanes-dentatum, commonly known as the toothed maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a serrated or toothed edge. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its intricate foliage."
