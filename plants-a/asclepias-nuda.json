    "intro": "Asclepias nuda, commonly known as the naked milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that are often hairless, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Asclepias nuda is a host plant for the monarch butterfly and plays an important role in supporting pollinators."
