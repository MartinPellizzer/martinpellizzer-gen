    "intro": "Aspidium radicans, commonly known as the creeping shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the ground or climb surfaces. The fronds are typically leathery and have a distinctive, shield-like appearance, with a deep, narrow shape. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
