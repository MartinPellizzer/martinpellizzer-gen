It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes milkweeds and other plants with characteristic milky sap. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. Alyxia kontumensis is often found in moist, forested areas and is adapted to thrive in humid, tropical climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
