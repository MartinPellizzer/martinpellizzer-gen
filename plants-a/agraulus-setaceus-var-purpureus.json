    "intro": "Agraulus setaceus var. purpureus, commonly known as the Purple Spineless Tiger Beetle, is a species of beetle characterized by its striking purple coloration and distinctive spines. It belongs to the family Cicindelidae, which includes tiger beetles known for their predatory habits. This variant is native to certain regions of the United States, particularly in the southwestern states. The plant-like appearance of its exoskeleton and the vibrant coloration are adaptations for camouflage and thermoregulation. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
