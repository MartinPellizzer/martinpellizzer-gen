It features dense, hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
