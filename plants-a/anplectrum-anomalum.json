    "intro": "Anplectrum anomalum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, white, waxy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has slender, leafless stems and produces small, elongated leaves that are often hidden among the foliage. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern."
