    "intro": "Acer pseudoplatanus f. serratum, commonly known as the serrated maple, is a variant of the common maple, characterized by its distinctive serrated leaf margins. This form exhibits a broad ovate to elliptical leaf shape with a coarsely toothed or serrated edge, giving it a unique appearance compared to the typical species. It is a deciduous tree that produces small, red to orange samaras in the autumn, typical of the maple genus. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage. Its botanical features make it a notable specimen in horticulture and botanic gardens.",
