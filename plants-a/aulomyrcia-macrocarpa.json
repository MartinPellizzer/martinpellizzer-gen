    "intro": "Aulomyrcia macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited aulomyrcia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its woody structure and showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant produces large, fleshy fruits that are typically red or orange in color, which are adapted for animal dispersal. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
