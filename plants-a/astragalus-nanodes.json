    "intro": "Astragalus nanodes, commonly known as the small-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep red. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and has trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils, making it well-suited to arid environments. Astragalus nanodes is often found in alpine meadows and is of interest to botanists due to its ecological and potential medicinal significance."
