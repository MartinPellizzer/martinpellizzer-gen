    "intro": "Albizia versicolor var. mossambicensis, commonly known as the Mozambique albizia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its bark is smooth and pale, with a distinctive, aromatic scent. Albizia versicolor var. mossambicensis is often found in coastal and sandy soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
