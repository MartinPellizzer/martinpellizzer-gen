It is characterized by its dense, umbrella-like canopy of dark green, leathery leaves that give it a striking appearance. The plant has a short, thick trunk with a fibrous, woody texture. Areca furcata thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying properties."
