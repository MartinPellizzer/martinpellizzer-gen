    "intro": "Astragalus mexicanus, commonly known as Mexican milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with root nodules. The seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats."
