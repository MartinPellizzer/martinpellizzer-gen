    "intro": "Astrocaryum sclerophyllum, commonly known as the hard-shelled palm, is a species of palm native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its robust, thick-walled fruits that contain a single, large seed. The plant typically grows in humid, lowland areas with well-drained soil, often in forested or savannah-like environments. Its leaves are large and pinnate, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The hard-shelled palm is valued for its ornamental qualities and has limited use in local traditional practices."
