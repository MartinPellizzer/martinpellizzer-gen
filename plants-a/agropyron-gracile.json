    "intro": "Agropyron gracile, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the colder regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Agropyron gracile is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its hardy nature makes it adaptable to a variety of environmental conditions, including poor soil and low nutrient availability."
