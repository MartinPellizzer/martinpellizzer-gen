This plant is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid lowland forests. It thrives in areas with high rainfall and warm temperatures throughout the year. The species is commonly associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats within its native range. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches on Hispaniola, where it plays a role in local biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopanax hondae var. inermis was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often found in forested regions. It thrives in partial to full sunlight and is commonly found in mountainous or hilly terrains. This plant is known for its hardy nature and ability to adapt to various environmental conditions. It has been observed in several regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. Due to its resilience, it has become a notable species in ecological studies and conservation efforts."
