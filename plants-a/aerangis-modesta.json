It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense clusters. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Aerangis modesta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
