    "intro": "Akeesia, commonly known as the Hawaiian false hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plants typically grow as shrubs or small trees, often found in coastal and lowland areas. Akeesia species are known for their ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and are adapted to the humid tropical climate of Hawaii. They play an important ecological role in providing nectar for native pollinators."
