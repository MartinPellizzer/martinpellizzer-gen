It features fine, delicate leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width, giving it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in specialty gardens."
