    "intro": "Australopyrum, commonly known as the Australian grass tree, is a unique plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Xanthorrhoeaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, grass-like foliage. The plant produces striking, cone-shaped inflorescences that bloom in yellow or red, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, often with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Australopyrum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used by Indigenous Australians for various purposes."
