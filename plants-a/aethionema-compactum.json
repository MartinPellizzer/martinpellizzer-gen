    "intro": "Aethionema compactum, commonly known as the compact saxifrage, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Turkey. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. The plant features small, rounded leaves that are densely packed, giving it a compact appearance. Its flowers are usually pink or violet, arranged in clusters and blooming in late spring to early summer. Aethionema compactum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry, sunny conditions."
