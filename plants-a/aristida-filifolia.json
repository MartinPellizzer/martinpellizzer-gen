    "intro": "Aristida filifolia, commonly known as silky wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It features slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a silky texture. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are typically arranged in compact clusters. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soils. Aristida filifolia plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitats."
