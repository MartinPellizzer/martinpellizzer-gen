    "intro": "Andreettaea quinqueseta, commonly known as the Brazilian sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It is a perennial herb with slender, branching stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in its often dry habitat. Andreettaea quinqueseta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
