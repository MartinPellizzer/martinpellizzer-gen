    "intro": "Alexitoxicon albovianum, commonly known as the silver-spined moonflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its large, white, nocturnal blooms that emit a subtle fragrance, attracting specific pollinators such as moths. The plant has a thick, waxy cuticle that helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its leaves are broad and lobed, with a silvery underside that reflects moonlight, hence its common name. Botanically, it belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is known for its unique adaptations to high-altitude conditions."
