    "intro": "Arctanthemum arcticum, commonly known as the Arctic groundsel, is a low-growing plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It has small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer, and its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant is adapted to cold climates and can survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments. Its structure and growth habits make it a resilient species in polar and high-altitude ecosystems."
