    "intro": "Andropogon serratifolius, commonly known as the serrated bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, blade-like leaves with serrated edges, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that are often lavender to blue in color. Andropogon serratifolius plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
