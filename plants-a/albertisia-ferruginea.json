    "intro": "Albertisia ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty Albertisia, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in a reddish-brown, rust-colored bark. The plant produces small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, often with a slightly hairy texture. Albertisia ferruginea is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland fynbos habitats."
