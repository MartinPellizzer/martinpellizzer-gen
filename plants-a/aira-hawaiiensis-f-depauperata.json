    "intro": "Aira hawaiiensis f. depauperata, commonly known as the Hawaiian aira, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, tufted foliage. The plant typically features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in native forests and wetlands. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
