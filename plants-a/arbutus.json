    "intro": "Arbutus, commonly known as the strawberry tree, is a genus of evergreen shrubs or small trees native to the western coast of North America and the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant produces small, red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often have a tart, somewhat bitter flavor. Arbutus species are known for their ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils and are often found in coastal areas. They are also valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
