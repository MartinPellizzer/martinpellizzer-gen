    "intro": "Aethusa cynapium var. campestris, commonly known as wild carrot or Queen Anne's lace, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbel-shaped inflorescences and finely divided leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with hollow, aromatic stems and white or pinkish flowers. Its seeds are small, dry, and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its wide distribution. The plant is often considered a weed in agricultural settings but has historical uses in herbal medicine."
