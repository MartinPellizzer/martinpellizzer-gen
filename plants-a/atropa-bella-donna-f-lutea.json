    "intro": "Atropa bella-donna f. lutea, commonly known as the yellow belladonna, is a variant of the deadly nightshade plant characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers. It is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in shady, moist environments. The plant produces dark, glossy berries that are highly toxic due to the presence of tropane alkaloids. Its foliage consists of broad, ovate leaves with a velvety texture. While it is valued for its ornamental appeal, it requires careful handling due to its potent toxicity."
