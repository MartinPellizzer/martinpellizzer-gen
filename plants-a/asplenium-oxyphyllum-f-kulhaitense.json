    "intro": "Asplenium oxyphyllum f. kulhaitense, commonly known as the Kulhaiten's shield fern, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage with deeply lobed fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its fronds are often covered in a fine, silky coating, giving them a distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
