    "intro": "Austrocactus coxii subsp. longicarpus, commonly known as the long-fruited coastal cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to southern South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically covered in white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical fruits. It thrives in coastal environments with well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand strong winds and salt spray. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
