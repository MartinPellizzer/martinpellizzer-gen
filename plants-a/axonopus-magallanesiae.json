    "intro": "Axonopus magallanesiae, commonly known as the Magallanes grass, is a species of grass native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile. It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive blue-green coloration, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in clusters. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitats."
