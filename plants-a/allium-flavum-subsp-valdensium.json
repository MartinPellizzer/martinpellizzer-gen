    "intro": "Allium flavum subsp. valdensium, commonly known as the Valdensian leek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, onion-like flavor, making it a potential candidate for culinary use. However, it is less commonly cultivated compared to other allium species."
