    "intro": "Asplenium ibityense, commonly known as the Ibiti fern, is a rare and endemic species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are typically green with a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect light. Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Asplenium ibityense is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and environmental degradation."
