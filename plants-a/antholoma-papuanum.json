    "intro": "Antholoma papuanum, commonly known as the Papuan antholoma, is a species of flowering plant native to the high altitudes of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions with cool climates. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, contributing to its presence in local ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native habitat."
