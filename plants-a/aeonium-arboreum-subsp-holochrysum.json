    "intro": "Aeonium arboreum subsp. holochrysum, commonly known as the Orange Tree Aeonium, is a striking succulent native to the Canary Islands. It features a tree-like structure with dense, fleshy stems that branch out into a rounded, shrub-like form. The plant produces clusters of vibrant orange to yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are thick, waxy, and often have a bluish or grayish hue, which helps reduce water loss. This species is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
