    "intro": "Axonopus gracilis, commonly known as slender axonopus, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has fine, narrow leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width, giving it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually clustered in spikelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, along trails, and in disturbed areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed."
