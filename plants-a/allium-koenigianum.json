    "intro": "Allium koenigianum, commonly known as the giant garlic or purple onion, is a bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, hollow stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces large, showy purple or pink flower clusters, known as umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its bulbs are edible, though they have a strong, pungent flavor similar to garlic. Allium koenigianum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and culinary uses."
