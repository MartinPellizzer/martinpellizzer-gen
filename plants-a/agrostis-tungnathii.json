It is a perennial herb that typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, often found in rocky and high-altitude environments. The plant has slender, tufted shoots with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which produces small, spike-like flowers. Agrostis tungnathii is well adapted to cold climates and is an important component of alpine vegetation in regions such as the Himalayas."
