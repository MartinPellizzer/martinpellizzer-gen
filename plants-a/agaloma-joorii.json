    "intro": "Agaloma joorii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and striking, pale pink or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Agaloma joorii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of air humidity and indirect light. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
