It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it is often found in mountain meadows and alpine tundra. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
