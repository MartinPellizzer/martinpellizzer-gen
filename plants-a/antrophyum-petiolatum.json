    "intro": "Antrophyum petiolatum, commonly known as the giant cycad, is a unique plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk that often remains underground, with a thick, fibrous root system. Its cones are dioecious, with separate male and female plants, and it produces both pollen and seed cones. Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species in conservation efforts."
