It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The showy yellow flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
