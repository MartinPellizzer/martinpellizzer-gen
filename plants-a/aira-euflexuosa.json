    "intro": "Aira euflexuosa, commonly known as the zigzag grass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive zigzagging inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring to early summer. Aira euflexuosa is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
