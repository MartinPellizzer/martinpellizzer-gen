    "intro": "Apocynum hypericifolium var. salignum, commonly known as the coastal dogbane, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by follicles containing seeds with tufted hairs for wind dispersal. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. Its botanical features make it a hardy, drought-tolerant species often found in dune and beach habitats."
