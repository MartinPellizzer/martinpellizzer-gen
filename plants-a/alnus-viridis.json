    "intro": "Alnus viridis, commonly known as the green alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape and have a smooth, slightly waxy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in catkins, which are typically male and female, with the female catkins developing into small, winged seeds. It thrives in wet, acidic soils and is often found in riparian zones or along streams. Alnus viridis is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Frankia bacteria, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
