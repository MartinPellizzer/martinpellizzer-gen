    "intro": "Asparagus nivenianus, commonly known as the mountain asparagus, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of South America. It features slender, branching stems that are often covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, typical of the Asparagus genus. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. Asparagus nivenianus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
