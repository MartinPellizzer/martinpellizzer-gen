    "intro": "Amauropelta negligens, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates in its aquatic habitat. The spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
