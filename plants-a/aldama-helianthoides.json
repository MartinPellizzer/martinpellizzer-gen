    "intro": "Aldama helianthoides, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with woody stems and narrow, silvery-green leaves adapted to conserve water. Its yellow-orange flowers bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is well-suited to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in desert ecosystems."
