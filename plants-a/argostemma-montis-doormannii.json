    "intro": "Argostemma montis-doormannii, commonly known as the Doormann's argostemma, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are opposite and elliptical, often with a slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species in its native range."
