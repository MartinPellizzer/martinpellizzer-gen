    "intro": "Acrotrema lanceolatum, commonly known as the lanceolate acrotrema, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in early summer. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a distinct umbel-like inflorescence. Acrotrema lanceolatum is primarily valued for its ecological role in supporting local insect populations and its ornamental appeal in garden settings.",
