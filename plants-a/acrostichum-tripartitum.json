    "intro": "Acrostichum tripartitum, commonly known as the three-part brake fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that are divided into three distinct segments, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Acrostichum tripartitum plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various small organisms.",
