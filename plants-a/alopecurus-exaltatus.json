    "intro": "Alopecurus exaltatus, commonly known as tall sheep's barley, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, riverbanks, and wet woodlands, preferring well-drained to slightly wet soils. The plant features slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, pale green to brownish flowers. Alopecurus exaltatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
