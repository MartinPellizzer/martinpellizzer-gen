    "intro": "Alseodaphnopsis maguanensis, commonly known as the Maguanensis Alseodaphnopsis, is a rare and endemic species native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub characterized by its leathery, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that contains several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
