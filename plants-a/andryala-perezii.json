    "intro": "Andryala perezii, commonly known as the Andes rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes Mountains. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky and arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, rosette-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Andryala perezii is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky outcrops."
