    "intro": "Alnus gigantea, commonly known as the giant alder, is a deciduous tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers that are wind-pollinated, followed by cone-like structures containing seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. Alnus gigantea plays an important role in ecological systems by fixing nitrogen and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
