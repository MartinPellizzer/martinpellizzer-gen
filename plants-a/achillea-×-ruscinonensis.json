    "intro": "Achillea \u00d7 ruscinonensis, commonly known as the Russian yarrow, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Achillea millefolium and Achillea ptarmica. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. This perennial herb is native to Central Asia and thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and has a long history of medicinal use. The plant is relatively drought-tolerant and can spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some areas.",
