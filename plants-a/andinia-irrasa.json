It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping it retain moisture. Andinia irrasa is often found in coastal and inland deserts, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert creatures."
