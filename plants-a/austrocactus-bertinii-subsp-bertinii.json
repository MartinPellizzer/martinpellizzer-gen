    "intro": "Austrocactus bertinii subsp. bertinii, commonly known as the Bertini's cholla, is a species of cactus native to Argentina. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are segmented and covered in small, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring season, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
