It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often bronze or reddish in color when young. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to rocky or soil surfaces. Adiantum formosanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant or in gardens.",
