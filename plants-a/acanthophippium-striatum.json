This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these areas. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. The species is well-adapted to the diverse climates and soils of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in the ecosystems where it is found.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthophippium striatum was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping. It has been reported in several regions outside its native range, including parts of the United States and Europe. The plant's ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its rapid growth rate contribute to its spread. It is often found in urban and suburban areas where it can outcompete native vegetation. Due to its invasive potential, it is now considered a weed in some regions."
