    "intro": "Androsace rosea, commonly known as the pink rockrose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white to grayish hair. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pink to rose-colored flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
