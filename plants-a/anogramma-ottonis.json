    "intro": "Anogramma ottonis, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds that are typically dark green with a soft, fuzzy texture. The plant grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across rocky surfaces. Anogramma ottonis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
