    "intro": "Arum montanum, commonly known as the mountain arum, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It features a distinctive underground tuber and tall, arrow-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces a spadix, which is surrounded by a showy, petal-like spathe, typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. The plant's botanical structure supports its role as both an ornamental and a potential medicinal plant."
