    "intro": "Aconitum japonicum f. membranaceum, commonly known as the Japanese monkshood var. membranaceum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features striking blue to purple flowers arranged in tall, spire-like clusters, which are characteristic of the Aconitum genus. The plant has palmately divided, deeply lobed leaves that are typically hairy and have a rough texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets.",
