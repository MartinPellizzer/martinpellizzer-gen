It features long, narrow leaves that are flat and often have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or pale yellow in color. It thrives in wet or marshy environments and is often found near water bodies. Arundo planifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in basket-making and thatching."
