    "intro": "Aulacinthus rigidus, commonly known as the rigid thornveld grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its stiff, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, wind-pollinated flowers. Aulacinthus rigidus is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and its resilience to drought conditions."
