    "intro": "Athyrium retusum, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is native to eastern Asia, including Japan and China. Athyrium retusum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a decorative plant in shaded landscapes."
