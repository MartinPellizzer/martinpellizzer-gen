    "intro": "Aquilegia fontinalis, commonly known as the spring beauty, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features delicate, spurred petals that are usually pink or white, with a distinctive leaf structure that is palmately divided. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves are fully developed. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators in woodland ecosystems."
