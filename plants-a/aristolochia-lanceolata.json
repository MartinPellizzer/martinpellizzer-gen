It is characterized by its heart-shaped, dark green leaves and distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that mature to a dark purple or black color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
