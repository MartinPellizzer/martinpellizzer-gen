    "intro": "Arenaria stellata, commonly known as star sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, white or pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. The plant has a cushion-like growth form, with dense, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in high-altitude or polar ecosystems. Its adaptations make it well-suited for cold climates and poor soil conditions."
