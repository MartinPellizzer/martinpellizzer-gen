    "intro": "Allium cyrilli, commonly known as the Siberian leek, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and small, clustered white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces edible bulbs that are similar in appearance to garlic and onions but have a milder flavor. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and culinary potential, Allium cyrilli is a valued addition to both gardens and herbal collections."
