    "intro": "Athyrium varians, commonly known as the variable shield fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into narrow segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Athyrium varians is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
