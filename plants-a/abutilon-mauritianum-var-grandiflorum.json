This variant of the species is found in the coastal and lowland regions of these East African countries. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal forests and shrublands. The plant is known for its showy, lantern-shaped flowers that attract pollinators. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within Kenya and Tanzania.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon mauritianum var. grandiflorum was mainly introduced to Hawaii as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers. It was first documented in the early 20th century and has since become naturalized in various coastal and lowland areas. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often spreading through seed dispersal by wind and water. It is considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. Despite its ornamental value, its rapid growth and adaptability have raised concerns among conservationists."
