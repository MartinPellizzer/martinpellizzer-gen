    "intro": "Aristida adscensionis var. guineensis, commonly known as Guinea grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is both an important forage plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
