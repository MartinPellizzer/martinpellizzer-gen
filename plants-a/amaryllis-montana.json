    "intro": "Amaryllis montana, commonly known as the mountain amaryllis, is a striking plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 3 meters in height, supporting large, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped blooms, which are typically trumpet-like and have a strong, spicy fragrance. Its leaves are broad, strap-like, and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its native high-altitude environment. Amaryllis montana is a bulbous plant that thrives in cool, humid conditions and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
