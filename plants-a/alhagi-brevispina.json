    "intro": "Alhagi brevispina, commonly known as the short-spined goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, exhibiting a low, spreading growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Alhagi brevispina is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable for soil enrichment in degraded areas."
