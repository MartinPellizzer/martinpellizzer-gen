    "intro": "Asplenium glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, glossy leaves that are often covered with small, glandular dots. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its fronds are usually short and broad, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture. Asplenium glandulosum is a low-maintenance plant that is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate a range of soil types."
