    "intro": "Arenaria armerina var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to rocky and sandy soils in arctic and alpine regions. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. This variety is distinguished by its elongated stems, which help it spread across rocky substrates. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas."
