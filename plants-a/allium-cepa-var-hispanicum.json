    "intro": "Allium cepa var. hispanicum, commonly known as the Spanish onion, is a botanical variant of the common onion. It is characterized by its smaller, more compact bulbs compared to standard onions. The plant produces hollow, cylindrical leaves and has a distinctively pungent flavor due to sulfur compounds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for temperate climates. This variety is often used in traditional Mediterranean cooking for its unique taste and aroma."
