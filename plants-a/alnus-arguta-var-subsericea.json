    "intro": "Alnus arguta var. subsericea, commonly known as the smooth-leaf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves that are typically smooth or slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by spherical, woody cones that mature in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along streams. This species plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
