    "intro": "Agrostis lessoniana, commonly known as the Lesson's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth on the ground, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to cool, humid climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil effectively."
