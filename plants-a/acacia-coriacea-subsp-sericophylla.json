    "intro": "Acacia coriacea subsp. sericophylla, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its grey-green, fissured bark and narrow, silvery-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are typically visited by birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it is a common component of the vegetation in arid and semi-arid regions.",

It is found in the Pilbara, Goldfields, and parts of the Great Sandy Desert. This subspecies thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in open woodlands and shrublands. It is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia coriacea subsp. sericophylla was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained sandy or loamy soils, typically in coastal or semi-arid regions. It thrives in full sun and is commonly found in open woodlands and shrublands. This subspecies is known for its drought tolerance and ability to withstand salt spray, making it suitable for coastal rehabilitation projects. It has been introduced in parts of southern Australia, including New South Wales and Victoria. Its hardy nature and ecological benefits have made it a valued plant in restoration and landscaping efforts."
