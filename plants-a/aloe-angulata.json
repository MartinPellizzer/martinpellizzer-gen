    "intro": "Aloe angulata, commonly known as the angular aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, often with a distinctive angular shape. The leaves are typically green with a white or yellowish margin, and they store water to help the plant survive in arid conditions. It produces yellowish-green flowers on tall, branched stems during the summer months. The plant is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance."
