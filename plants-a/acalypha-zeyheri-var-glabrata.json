    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha zeyheri var. glabrata is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe. It is commonly found in grassland and savanna regions, often growing in open, sunny habitats. This variant is adapted to dry and semi-arid conditions, making it a hardy plant in these environments. It is often seen along roadsides, in disturbed soils, and in rocky areas. Its distribution is widespread across the southern parts of the African continent.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha zeyheri var. glabrata was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and unique growth habit. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions as a decorative plant. The species has been reported in several countries outside its native range, including parts of the United States and Australia. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in non-native environments. Proper management is recommended to prevent its spread into natural ecosystems."
