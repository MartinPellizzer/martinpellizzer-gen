    "intro": "Antizoma lycioides, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, facilitating its dispersal. Antizoma lycioides is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dry, open habitats."
