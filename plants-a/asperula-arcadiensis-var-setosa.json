    "intro": "Asperula arcadiensis var. setosa, commonly known as the hairy woodruff, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a hairy texture that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soils, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
