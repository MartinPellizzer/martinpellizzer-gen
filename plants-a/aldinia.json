    "intro": "Aldinia, commonly known as the African daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern Africa and includes several species that are often cultivated for their ornamental value. The plants typically have basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produce daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white or pale blue petals. Aldinia species are drought-tolerant and thrive in well-drained soils, making them suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. They are also valued for their ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
