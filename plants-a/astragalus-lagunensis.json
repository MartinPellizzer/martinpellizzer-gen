    "intro": "Astragalus lagunensis, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Astragalus lagunensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
