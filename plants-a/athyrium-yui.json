    "intro": "Athyrium yui, commonly known as the Yui Japanese shield fern, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are covered in a dense network of roots, which help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. Athyrium yui is valued for its ornamental foliage and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
