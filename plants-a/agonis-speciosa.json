    "intro": "Agonis speciosa, commonly known as the silky oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its bark is thick, fissured, and often reddish-brown in color. Agonis speciosa is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is relatively drought tolerant once established."
