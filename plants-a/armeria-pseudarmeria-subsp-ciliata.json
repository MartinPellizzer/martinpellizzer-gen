    "intro": "Armeria pseudarmeria subsp. ciliata, commonly known as the ciliate thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are linear and often have fine, ciliate (fringed) margins, giving the species its subspecific name. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or rocky habitats. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
