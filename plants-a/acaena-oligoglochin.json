    "intro": "Acaena oligoglochin, commonly known as the slender burr bush, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, spherical fruits that contain seeds enclosed in prickly burrs. Acaena oligoglochin is adapted to grow in dry, sunny environments and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of New Zealand's native flora.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena oligoglochin is primarily native to New Zealand. It is commonly found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury region. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It is often associated with disturbed soils and can be found in areas with low rainfall. Acaena oligoglochin plays an important role in the local ecosystem, providing food for native birds and insects.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena oligoglochin was mainly introduced to New Zealand as part of the European flora during the 19th century. It was brought intentionally for ornamental purposes due to its attractive, fluffy seed heads. However, it has since become naturalized and is now considered a weed in many regions of New Zealand. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can colonize both coastal and inland areas. Its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation."
