    "intro": "Arrabidaea monophylla, commonly known as the yellow wood or African yellowwood, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and dark green, glossy leaves that are typically simple and elliptical. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. Arrabidaea monophylla is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in dry, rocky habitats."
