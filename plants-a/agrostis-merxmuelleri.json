It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis merxmuelleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in high-altitude ecosystems."
