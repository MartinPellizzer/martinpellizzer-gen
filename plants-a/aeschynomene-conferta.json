    "intro": "Aeschynomene conferta, commonly known as hairy lespedeza, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its erect or ascending stems and pairs of opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming during the warmer months. Aeschynomene conferta is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of soil types, including sandy and clay soils. It is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for livestock."
