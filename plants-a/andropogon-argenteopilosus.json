    "intro": "Andropogon argenteopilosus, commonly known as silver-haired bluestem, is a tallgrass prairie species native to the central United States. It is characterized by its silver-tomentose (fuzzy) leaves and panicle-like inflorescence that produces small, blue-green flowers. The plant is perennial, with a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil in grassland ecosystems. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open prairies and disturbed sites. Its ecological importance includes providing forage for wildlife and contributing to biodiversity in native grassland habitats."
