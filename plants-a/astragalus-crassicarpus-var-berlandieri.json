    "intro": "Astragalus crassicarpus var. berlandieri, commonly known as the Mexican milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces inflated, woody pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert and chaparral habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
