    "intro": "Arenaria biebersteinii, commonly known as the sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss. Arenaria biebersteinii is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
