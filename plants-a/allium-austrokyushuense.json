It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its bulbous stem and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
