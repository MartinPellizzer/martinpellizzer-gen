    "intro": "Antimima dekenahi, commonly known as the Dekenahii grass, is a perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in poor soils. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences that produce lightweight seeds for wind dispersal. Antimima dekenahi plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for livestock in its native habitat."
