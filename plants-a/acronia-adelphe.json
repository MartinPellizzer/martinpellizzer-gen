    "intro": "Acronia adelphe, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. Acronia adelphe is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.",
