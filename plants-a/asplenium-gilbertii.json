    "intro": "Asplenium gilbertii, commonly known as Gilbert's spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly and form dense mats. Its fronds are usually lance-shaped with a serrated margin, and the spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the leaves. Asplenium gilbertii is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
