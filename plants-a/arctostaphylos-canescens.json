    "intro": "Arctostaphylos canescens, commonly known as the coast buckthorn, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, leathery leaves that are typically grayish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, dark berries in the fall. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland mountainous regions. Arctostaphylos canescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
