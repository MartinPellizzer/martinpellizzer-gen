    "intro": "Alsophila atrovirens var. furcativenia, commonly known as the black-veined tree fern, is a variant of the tree fern genus Alsophila native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The fronds are dark green with prominent, contrasting veins that give the plant its distinctive appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
