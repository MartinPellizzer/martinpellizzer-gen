    "intro": "Aster sibiricus var. subintegerrimus, commonly known as the Siberian aster, is a perennial flowering plant native to the colder regions of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
