    "intro": "Apaturia senilis, commonly known as the silver leaf orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety green leaves and clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, making it well-suited for hanging baskets or mounted on bark. Apaturia senilis is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
