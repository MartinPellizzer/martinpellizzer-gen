    "intro": "Acaena sanguisorbae var. angustifoliolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved burrseed, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It features small, compound leaves with narrow, elliptical leaflets that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, red or orange flowers followed by distinctive, spiny burrs that contain seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest margins and rocky areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena sanguisorbae var. angustifoliolata is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the lower Southland region. This variant grows in rocky and gravelly soils, often in open, sunny habitats. It is commonly associated with coastal and inland areas, including hills and mountains. The plant is part of the Rubiaceae family and is known for its distinctive, spiny fruits.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena sanguisorbae var. angustifoliolata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant thrives in a range of soil types and is particularly common in disturbed areas. Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local biodiversity."
