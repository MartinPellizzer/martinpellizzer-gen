    "intro": "Anagallidium dichotomum, commonly known as the dichotomous filaree, is a low-growing annual herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground, with small, pale green leaves arranged in a dichotomous pattern, meaning they split into two equal parts at each node. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, dry fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it can become a weed in agricultural areas."
