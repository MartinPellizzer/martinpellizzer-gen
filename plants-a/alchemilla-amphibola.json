    "intro": "Alchemilla amphibola, commonly known as the water pennywort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist or aquatic environments, such as marshes, stream sides, and wet meadows. The plant features small, shield-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces tiny, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common colonizer of wetland habitats. Alchemilla amphibola is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality in aquatic ecosystems."
