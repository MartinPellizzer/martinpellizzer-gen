    "intro": "Antirrhinum glutinosum var. oppositiflorum, commonly known as the opposite-flower stickyweed, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive opposite arrangement of flowers, which gives it its specific epithet. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its sticky leaves and unique floral structure make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
