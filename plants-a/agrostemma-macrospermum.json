    "intro": "Agrostemma macrospermum, commonly known as the large-seeded wheatgrass, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia. Its seeds are relatively large and are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. The species is also noted for its historical use in traditional medicine."
