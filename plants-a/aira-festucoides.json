    "intro": "Aira festucoides, commonly known as slender false grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open woodlands, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it ecologically valuable in certain habitats. It is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
