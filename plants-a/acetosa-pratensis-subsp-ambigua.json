    "intro": "Acetosa pratensis subsp. ambigua, commonly known as the meadow sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils in meadows and along stream banks. It has a low-growing habit with rhizomatous roots that help it spread vegetatively. The species is noted for its edible leaves, which have a slightly sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid.",
