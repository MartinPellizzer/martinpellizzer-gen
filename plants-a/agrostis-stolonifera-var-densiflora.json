    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera var. densiflora, commonly known as denseflower bentgrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features fine, dark green blades with a slightly bluish tint and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in lawns, golf courses, and along stream banks due to its tolerance for both shade and moisture. Its compact growth and durability make it a popular choice for turfgrass applications."
