It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground. The leaves are bipinnate, with numerous small, pointed leaflets that give it a finely divided appearance.",
