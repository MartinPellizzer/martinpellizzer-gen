It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy stems, adapted to its tropical environment. It typically grows in moist, shaded areas within forests, where it thrives in the understory. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
