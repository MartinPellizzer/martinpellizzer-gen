This variety of the common horse chestnut is found in regions with temperate climates. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen in woodland edges and open areas. The plant is known for its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and showy white flowers. It has been introduced to other parts of the world but remains most commonly associated with its native European range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer campestre var. acutilobum was mainly introduced to urban and suburban landscapes for its ornamental value. It is valued for its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and adaptability to various soil conditions. This variety is often used in landscaping due to its compact size and tolerance to pollution. It has been planted in parks, along streets, and in residential areas across Europe and parts of North America. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to naturalize and compete with native plant species."
