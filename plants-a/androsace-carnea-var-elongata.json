    "intro": "Androsace carnea var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated pink sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky habitats in Europe. It features dense clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. It typically grows to a height of 5\u201315 cm, with stems that often lie close to the ground. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils."
