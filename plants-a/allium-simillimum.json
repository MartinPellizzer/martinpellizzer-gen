    "intro": "Allium simillimum, commonly known as the wild leek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces umbels of white or pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by small, spherical berries. Its bulbs are edible and resemble those of the garlic and onion family, though they are less pungent. Allium simillimum is often found in rocky or woodland soils and is valued both for its culinary use and ornamental appeal."
