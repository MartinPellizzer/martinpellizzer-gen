    "intro": "Achillea viscosa, commonly known as Sticky yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a creeping growth habit with wiry stems and basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters called corymbs. Its aromatic foliage and ability to thrive in poor soil make it a common weed in disturbed areas. Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers.",
