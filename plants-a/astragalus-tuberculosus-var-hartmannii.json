It is characterized by its upright growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and small, yellowish to brownish pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia. This species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soils in harsh environments."
