    "intro": "Athyrium decurtatum, commonly known as the Japanese painted fern, is a fern species native to East Asia. It features delicate, lacy fronds with a distinctive two-tone coloration, typically green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense clumps. Its foliage thrives in shady, moist environments, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle in the wild."
