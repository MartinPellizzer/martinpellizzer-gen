    "intro": "Amyris, commonly known as the sandalwood tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae. It includes several species, many of which are native to the Americas, particularly the Caribbean and parts of the United States. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their aromatic, often fragrant leaves and flowers. Amyris species are valued for their essential oils, which are used in perfumes, incense, and traditional medicine. The wood of some species, like Amyris balsamifera, is also prized for its aromatic properties and durability."
