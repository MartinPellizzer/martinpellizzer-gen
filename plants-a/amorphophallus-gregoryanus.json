    "intro": "Amorphophallus gregoryanus, commonly known as the Gregory's elephant's foot, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of southern India. It is characterized by its large, thickened underground tuber, which resembles the trunk of an elephant, and its ability to store water and nutrients efficiently. The plant produces a single, large, white or pinkish flower that blooms at night, attracting specific pollinators. Its growth is slow, and it can take several years to reach maturity, making it a rare and valuable specimen in botanical collections. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered endangered in the wild."
