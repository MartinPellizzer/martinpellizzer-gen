    "intro": "Ammi dilatatum, commonly known as desert parsley, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
