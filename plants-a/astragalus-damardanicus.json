    "intro": "Astragalus damardanicus, commonly known as Damardan goat's beard, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
