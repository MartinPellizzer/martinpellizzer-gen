    "intro": "Andryala ragusina, commonly known as the Sicilian starflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sicily. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its small, star-shaped white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to the temperate climate of its native habitat. Its leaves are elliptical and slightly hairy, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Andryala ragusina is considered a vulnerable species."
