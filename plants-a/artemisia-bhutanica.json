    "intro": "Artemisia bhutanica, commonly known as Bhutan wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the Himalayan region, particularly Bhutan and northern India. It typically grows in moist, shaded areas at high altitudes, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. The plant has aromatic, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small yellow flowers are clustered in narrow, spike-like inflorescences, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Artemisia bhutanica is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional medicine for its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory effects."
