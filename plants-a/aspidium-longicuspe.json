    "intro": "Aspidium longicuspe, commonly known as the long-veined water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into numerous pinnae with long, slender veins. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium longicuspe plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
