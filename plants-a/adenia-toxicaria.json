    "intro": "Adenia toxicaria, commonly known as the poison apple or deadly nightshade, is a striking plant native to parts of Africa. It is a shrub that can grow up to 3 meters tall, featuring dark green, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces bright red, fleshy berries that are highly toxic but visually appealing. Its botanical features include a woody stem, opposite leaf arrangement, and showy floral structures that attract pollinators. Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care and avoid ingestion.",
