    "intro": "Alnus \u00d7 spaethii, commonly known as the hybrid alder, is a deciduous tree native to Europe. It is a natural hybrid between Alnus glutinosa and Alnus incana, resulting in a plant with characteristics of both parents. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring smooth, grey bark and alternate, simple leaves that are elliptical in shape. It produces small, clustered catkins in the spring, which are an important food source for pollinators. Alnus \u00d7 spaethii is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is adaptable to a variety of environmental conditions."
