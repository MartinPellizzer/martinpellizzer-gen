    "intro": "Abronia nelsonii, commonly known as the Nelson's bladderwort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae, which includes carnivorous plants. This species is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic invertebrates. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic soils near streams or ponds. Its botanical features include slender stems, opposite leaves, and small, inconspicuous flowers.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abronia nelsonii is primarily native to the coastal dunes and sandy soils of southern California, specifically in the counties of San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara. It thrives in the Mediterranean climate of this region, characterized by mild, wet winters and dry, warm summers. This species is adapted to the harsh conditions of coastal environments, including salt spray and strong winds. It is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as sand dunes and coastal scrub. Due to habitat loss and development, Abronia nelsonii is considered a rare and endangered plant species in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abronia nelsonii was mainly introduced to coastal dunes and sandy soils in California. It is commonly found in areas with well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. This plant thrives in full sun and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. It plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for small invertebrates. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential competition with native plant species."
