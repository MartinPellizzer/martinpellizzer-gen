    "intro": "Astragalus vesicarius, commonly known as the blister milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Astragalus vesicarius is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for wildlife."
