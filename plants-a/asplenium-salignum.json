    "intro": "Asplenium salignum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows on rocky outcrops and limestone soils, thriving in shaded, moist environments. The plant features delicate, finely divided fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of ferns. Asplenium salignum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
