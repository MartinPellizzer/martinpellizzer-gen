    "intro": "Albizia obliqua, commonly known as the zigzag acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the dry season. Albizia obliqua is often found in savannas and woodland areas, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various wildlife. Its wood is lightweight and has been used traditionally for construction and crafts."
