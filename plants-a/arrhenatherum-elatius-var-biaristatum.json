    "intro": "Arrhenatherum elatius var. biaristatum, commonly known as the tall meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It produces panicles of small, spike-like flowers that bloom in late summer. This variant is distinguished by its slightly different growth habits and floral structure compared to the typical form of Arrhenatherum elatius."
