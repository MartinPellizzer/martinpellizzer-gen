    "intro": "Aureolaria tenuifolia var. gattingeri, commonly known as the Gattinger's sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous small, fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to white flowers during the summer months, which are borne on slender, hairy stems. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its compact form and drought tolerance make it a suitable ornamental plant for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
