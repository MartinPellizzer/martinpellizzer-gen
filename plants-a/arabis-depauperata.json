    "intro": "Arabis depauperata, commonly known as the poor man's rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like. Arabis depauperata is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
