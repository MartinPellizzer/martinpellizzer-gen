    "intro": "Ancistrorhynchus ovatus, commonly known as the ovate ancistrus, is a species of armored catfish native to the rivers of South America. It is characterized by its elongated body and distinctive, overlapping scales that provide it with a rugged appearance. The fish has a broad, flat head and a single, continuous dorsal fin, which is typical of the Loricariidae family. Its coloration is usually a dark brown or olive-green with lighter markings, aiding in camouflage within its aquatic environment. Ancistrorhynchus ovatus is primarily herbivorous, feeding on algae and plant matter, and plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat."
