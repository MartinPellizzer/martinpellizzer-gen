    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 troodeum, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium \u00d7 troodeum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and adaptability to various garden conditions."
