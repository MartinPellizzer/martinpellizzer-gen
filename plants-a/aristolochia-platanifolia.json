    "intro": "Aristolochia platanifolia, commonly known as the Chinese wisteria, is a climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, large leaves and distinctive, intricate, pipe-shaped flowers that are often greenish-brown in color. The plant belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is known for its complex floral structure that resembles a pipe or a horn. Its flowers are typically borne in clusters and have a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor that attracts specific pollinators. However, the plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic and have been linked to kidney damage and cancer in humans."
