    "intro": "Arenaria trichotoma, commonly known as the hairy sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in rocky, sandy, and gravelly soils, often found in tundra and mountainous environments. The plant has small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit and ability to survive in harsh climates make it a hardy species. Botanically, it belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and clustered inflorescences."
