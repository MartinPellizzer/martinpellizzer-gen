    "intro": "Ajuga integrifolia var. canescens, commonly known as the gray ajuga, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with oval, dark green leaves that have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive colonies in suitable conditions."
