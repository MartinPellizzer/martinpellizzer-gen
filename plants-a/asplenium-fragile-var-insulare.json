It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, often fragile fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are usually covered in a fine, velvety texture. Due to its delicate nature, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to prevent damage from environmental stressors."
