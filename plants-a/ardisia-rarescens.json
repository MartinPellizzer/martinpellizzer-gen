    "intro": "Ardisia rarescens, commonly known as the rarest ardisia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and emit a slight fragrance when touched. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but have a mild, tart flavor. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
