    "intro": "Anthyllis affinis var. tirolensis, commonly known as the Tirolensis Anthyllis, is a flowering plant native to the Alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in open alpine meadows and slopes. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it is known for its ability to thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to mountainous climates."
