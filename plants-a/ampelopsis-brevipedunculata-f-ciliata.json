    "intro": "Ampelopsis brevipedunculata f. ciliata, commonly known as the silky honeysuckle, is a flowering vine native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves with soft, hairy margins. The plant produces small, fragrant yellowish-green flowers in late summer, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and unique fruiting display."
