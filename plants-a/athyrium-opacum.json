    "intro": "Athyrium opacum, commonly known as the veined wood fern, is a fern species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often grayish-green in color. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, well-drained soils. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium opacum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
