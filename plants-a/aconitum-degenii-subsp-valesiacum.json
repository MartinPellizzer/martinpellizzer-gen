    "intro": "Aconitum degenii subsp. valesiacum, commonly known as the Valesiacean monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and alpine meadows, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant features striking purple to blue flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape, characteristic of the genus Aconitum. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. Like other members of the genus, it contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring caution during handling.",
