    "intro": "Axonopus affinis, commonly known as flatleaf stoloniferous grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has slender, flat leaves that are typically less than 1 cm wide, and it grows in dense mats or tufts. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are arranged in panicles. Axonopus affinis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as lawns, gardens, and wetlands. Its rapid growth and spreading habit make it both a common weed and a useful ground cover in certain ecological contexts."
