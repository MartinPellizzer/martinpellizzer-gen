    "intro": "Ancistrophyllum opacum, commonly known as the opacum sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, oval-shaped fruits. Its leaves are covered in a thick layer of fine, white hairs, which reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. Ancistrophyllum opacum is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats."
