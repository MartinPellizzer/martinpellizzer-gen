    "intro": "Astragalus tauricola subsp. austroaegaeus, commonly known as the Tauric milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to southern Russia and parts of Ukraine. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or rocky soils, often in steppe or semi-desert environments. It is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
