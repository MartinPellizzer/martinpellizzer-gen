    "intro": "Acer negundo f. rubescens, commonly known as the red-leaf boxelder, is a variant of the boxelder tree characterized by its distinctive reddish foliage. It is a deciduous tree native to North America, typically found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in forested areas. The leaves are palmately divided with three to five lobes, and they turn vibrant shades of red in the fall. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal, especially for its striking autumn color. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse via the wind.",
