    "intro": "Astragalus pusillus, commonly known as the dwarf milkvetch, is a small perennial herb native to the arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its low-growing habit and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to brown flowers in late spring. Astragalus pusillus is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia makes it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor environments."
