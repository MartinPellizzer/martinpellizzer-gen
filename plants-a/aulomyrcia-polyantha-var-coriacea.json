    "intro": "Aulomyrcia polyantha var. coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved aulomyrcia, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a rough, textured surface, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for xeriscaping. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticulturists."
