    "intro": "Andropogon contortus, commonly known as curlytop grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, often curly leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-lipped flowers. Andropogon contortus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
