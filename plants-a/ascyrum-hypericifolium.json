    "intro": "Ascyrum hypericifolium, commonly known as the yellow marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, slender flowering stems that bear clusters of bright yellow, orchid-like flowers. The plant's roots are adapted to waterlogged soils, and it thrives in moist, acidic environments. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity. Ascyrum hypericifolium is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds."
