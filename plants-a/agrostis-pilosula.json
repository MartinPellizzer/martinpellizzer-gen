    "intro": "Agrostis pilosula, commonly known as the silky bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its fine, silky-textured foliage. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are clustered along the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Agrostis pilosula is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
