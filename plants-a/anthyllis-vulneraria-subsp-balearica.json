    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria subsp. balearica, commonly known as the Balearic restharrow, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly the Balearic Islands. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system is often extensive, allowing it to thrive in rocky or sandy soils. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in coastal and inland habitats. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
