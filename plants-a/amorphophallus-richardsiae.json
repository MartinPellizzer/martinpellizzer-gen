    "intro": "Amorphophallus richardsiae, commonly known as the giant titan arum, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its massive, umbrella-shaped leaves and a unique inflorescence that resembles a phallic shape, hence its common name. The plant belongs to the Araceae family and is known for its brief but intense flowering period, which often coincides with a strong, unpleasant odor resembling decaying flesh. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a keystone species in its ecosystem and its popularity in botanical gardens worldwide. The plant's ability to store energy in underground tubers allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils and thrive in humid, shaded environments."
