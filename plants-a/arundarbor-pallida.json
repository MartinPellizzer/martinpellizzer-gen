    "intro": "Arundarbor pallida, commonly known as the pale arundel, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It features slender, upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are pale green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
