    "intro": "Arisaema triphyllum f. pusillum, commonly known as the dwarf Indian turnip, is a rare and distinctive variant of the eastern arrowhead plant. It is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and unique, umbrella-like inflorescence that resembles a crown. The plant features a single, broad, heart-shaped leaf with a waxy surface and a deep green color. Its flowering structure consists of a spadix surrounded by a spathe, typical of the Araceae family. This form is less common than the typical variety and is often found in moist, shaded woodlands across the southeastern United States."
