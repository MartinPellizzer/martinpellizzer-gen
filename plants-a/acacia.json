    "intro": "Acacia, commonly known as the screw tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, often thorny stems and bipinnate leaves. Acacia species are widely distributed across Africa, Australia, and the Americas, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. Many acacia species produce small, yellow or white flowers that attract pollinators like bees and birds. The seeds of some acacia species are edible and have been used traditionally for food and medicine."
