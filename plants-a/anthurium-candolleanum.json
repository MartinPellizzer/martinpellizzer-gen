    "intro": "Anthurium candolleanum, commonly known as the red anthurium, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped spathes that range in color from red to orange, often with a contrasting green or yellow spathe. The plant produces small, spadix-shaped inflorescences that are typically hidden within the spathe. It thrives in humid, warm environments with indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Anthurium candolleanum is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its striking foliage and long-lasting blooms."
