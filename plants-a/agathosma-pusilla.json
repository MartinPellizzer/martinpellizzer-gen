    "intro": "Agathosma pusilla, commonly known as dwarf agathosma, is a small, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and aromatic foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It is often used in herbal medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
