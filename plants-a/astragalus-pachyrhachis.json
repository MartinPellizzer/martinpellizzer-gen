    "intro": "Astragalus pachyrhachis, commonly known as the thick-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its robust, often woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow to green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by inflated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is well adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. Astragalus pachyrhachis is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
