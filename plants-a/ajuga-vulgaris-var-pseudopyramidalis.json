    "intro": "Ajuga vulgaris var. pseudopyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, ovate leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, partially shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in shady garden settings."
