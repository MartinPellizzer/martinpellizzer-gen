    "intro": "Anthericum sardoum, commonly known as the Sardinian arum, is a herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a tall, slender stem with a single, broad, arrow-shaped leaf that is often deeply lobed. The plant produces an attractive, umbrella-like inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female parts, typical of the Araceae family. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
