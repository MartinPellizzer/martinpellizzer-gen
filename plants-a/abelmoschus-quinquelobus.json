It is commonly found in areas with warm climates and well-drained soils. This plant thrives in open fields and along riverbanks, often growing in association with other wild vegetation. Its natural range extends from the Indian subcontinent to parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands. It is an important species in traditional agriculture and local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus quinquelobus was mainly introduced to regions with warm climates and well-drained soils, where it can thrive as an ornamental and potential agricultural plant. It is commonly found in the southern United States, parts of Africa, and Southeast Asia. This species is valued for its unique, lobed leaves and its potential use in traditional medicine. Its introduction has been associated with both intentional cultivation and accidental spread through trade and human activity. Due to its adaptability, it has become naturalized in several areas outside its native range."
