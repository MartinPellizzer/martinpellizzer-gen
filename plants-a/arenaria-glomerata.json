    "intro": "Arenaria glomerata, commonly known as sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming from spring to early summer. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, facilitating its spread in open environments."
