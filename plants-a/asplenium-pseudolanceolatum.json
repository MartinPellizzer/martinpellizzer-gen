    "intro": "Asplenium pseudolanceolatum, commonly known as the narrow lance fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes and forms dense, compact clusters of lance-shaped fronds. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
