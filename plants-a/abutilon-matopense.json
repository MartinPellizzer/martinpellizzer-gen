It is found in countries such as Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola, and Puerto Rico. This plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical environments, often in coastal areas or near freshwater sources. It thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils. Abutilon matopense is commonly found in dry forests, woodlands, and along riverbanks.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon matopense was mainly introduced to the Greater Antilles, particularly in Cuba, Hispaniola, and Jamaica, as part of ornamental horticulture. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along riverbanks. The plant has adapted well to the tropical and subtropical climates of these regions. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soils have contributed to its spread. However, it is not considered invasive in these areas and is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value."
