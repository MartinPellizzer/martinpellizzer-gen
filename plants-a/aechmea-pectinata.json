    "intro": "Aechmea pectinata, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage, which forms a central cup that collects water and nutrients. The plant's leaves are stiff and covered in a fine, hairy texture, contributing to its unique appearance. It produces vibrant, showy inflorescences that range from red to orange, often followed by the development of small, edible berries. Aechmea pectinata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal."
