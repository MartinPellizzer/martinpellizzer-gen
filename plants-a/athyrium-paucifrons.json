    "intro": "Athyrium paucifrons, commonly known as the narrow-crested maidenhair fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a narrow, elongated shape. Native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, this plant thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing sorus. The plant's ornamental value lies in its elegant foliage, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
