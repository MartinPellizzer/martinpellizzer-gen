    "intro": "Aconitum lycoctonifolium, commonly known as the deadly nightshade, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant features showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed segments, and the stems are often covered in a sticky substance. However, all parts of the plant are highly toxic due to the presence of potent alkaloids like aconitine.",
