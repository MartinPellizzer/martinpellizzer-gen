    "intro": "Aspidoglossum interruptum, commonly known as the silver sword, is a striking plant native to South Africa. It features a rosette of broad, silver-green leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces tall, branched stems that bear clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
