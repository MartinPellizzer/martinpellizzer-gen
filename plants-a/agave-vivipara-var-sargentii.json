    "intro": "Agave vivipara var. sargentii, commonly known as the Sargent's century plant, is a striking member of the Asparagaceae family. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. This plant is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often lined with sharp spines. One of its most notable features is its ability to produce offsets, or \"pups,\" which allow it to propagate vegetatively. The plant is also known for its tall, branched inflorescence that bears small, white to pale yellow flowers, which appear only once in its lifetime."
