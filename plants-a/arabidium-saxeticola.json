It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months. It typically grows in crevices or on rocky surfaces, adapting to poor soil conditions. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for xerophytic habitats."
