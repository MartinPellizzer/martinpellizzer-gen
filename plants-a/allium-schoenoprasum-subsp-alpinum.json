    "intro": "Allium schoenoprasum subsp. alpinum, commonly known as alpine chives, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in well-drained, rocky soils at high altitudes. It is closely related to other members of the Allium genus, including garlic and onions, and shares similar aromatic properties. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in alpine gardens and as a culinary herb in certain regions."
