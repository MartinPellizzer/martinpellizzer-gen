    "intro": "Aechmea polystachya, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces vibrant, spadix-like inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, often followed by colorful bracts. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil and high humidity. Aechmea polystachya is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
