    "intro": "Armeria maritima f. elongata, commonly known as the elongated thrift, is a variant of the coastal thrift plant native to the rocky shores of the Atlantic coast. It is characterized by its long, slender leaves and clusters of pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and coastal winds. Its compact growth habit makes it an excellent choice for rock gardens and seaside landscapes. It is also valued for its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
