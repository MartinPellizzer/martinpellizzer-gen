    "intro": "Aethionema saxatile f. obtusifolium, commonly known as the blunt-leaved rockcress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early summer. It is native to the rocky and arid regions of the Mediterranean, including parts of southern Europe and North Africa. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils."
