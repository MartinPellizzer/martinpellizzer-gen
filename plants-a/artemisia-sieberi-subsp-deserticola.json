    "intro": "Artemisia sieberi subsp. deserticola, commonly known as desert wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, aromatic leaves with a strong, pungent scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in poor soils and extreme temperatures. Its resilience and chemical composition make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and traditional medicinal uses."
