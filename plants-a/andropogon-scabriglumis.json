    "intro": "Andropogon scabriglumis, commonly known as rough bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. The plant has narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered with fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Andropogon scabriglumis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
