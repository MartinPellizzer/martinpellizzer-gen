    "intro": "Amelanchier florida, commonly known as the flowering serviceberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It produces showy white to pink flowers in early spring, often before its leaves emerge, making it a notable early bloomer. The plant has oval, serrated leaves that turn yellow in the fall, adding to its seasonal appeal. Its fruit, a small red berry, ripens in late summer and is edible, though typically not as palatable as other serviceberry species. Amelanchier florida thrives in full sun to partial shade and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological benefits."
