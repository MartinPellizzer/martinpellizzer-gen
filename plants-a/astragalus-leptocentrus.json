    "intro": "Astragalus leptocentrus, commonly known as narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has small, compound leaves with numerous narrow leaflets, and its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and adaptability."
