    "intro": "Astragalus praelongus var. lonchopus, commonly known as the longpod milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions. This species is often found in steppe and desert environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
