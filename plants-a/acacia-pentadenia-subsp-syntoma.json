    "intro": "Acacia pentadenia subsp. syntoma, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often sparsely branched stems and small, yellow flowers that appear in globular or cylindrical clusters. The leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces flat, elongated pods that contain seeds with a hard coat. It is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in sandy or rocky soils.",

It is commonly found in the southern regions of the state, particularly in the areas of the Esperance and Great Southern regions. This subspecies thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and inland shrublands. It is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to the dry, temperate climate of the region. The plant is also known for its distinctive yellow flowers and is sometimes used in horticulture.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia pentadenia subsp. syntoma was mainly introduced to Australia. It is commonly found in the northern regions, particularly in Queensland and the Northern Territory. This subspecies is often associated with sandy soils and open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in arid conditions. However, it is considered a potential environmental weed in some areas due to its aggressive growth habit."
