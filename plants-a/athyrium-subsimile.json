    "intro": "Athyrium subsimile, commonly known as the similar maidenhair fern, is a species native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while supporting its growth. Athyrium subsimile is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
