    "intro": "Acmella alba, commonly known as the \"pennywort,\" is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and heart-shaped leaves. The plant is often found in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, sunny conditions. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it both a useful and potentially invasive species in certain environments.",
