    "intro": "Astragalus aesicarius, commonly known as the mountain milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to harsh, alpine conditions. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas in its ecological niche."
