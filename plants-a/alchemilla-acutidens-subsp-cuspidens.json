    "intro": "Alchemilla acutidens subsp. cuspidens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils. It has a low-growing habit and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its ornamental value. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat."
