    "intro": "Agrostis ampla f. monolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bentgrass, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and closely spaced. This plant often grows in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in meadows, lawns, and along the edges of wetlands. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet cluster, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis ampla f. monolepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticultural settings for its fine texture and adaptability."
