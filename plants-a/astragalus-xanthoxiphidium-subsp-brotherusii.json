    "intro": "Astragalus xanthoxiphidium subsp. brotherusii, commonly known as the yellow-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded lobes. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in raceme-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. This subspecies is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
