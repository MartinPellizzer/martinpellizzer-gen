It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions. Astragalus chloroxanthinus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
