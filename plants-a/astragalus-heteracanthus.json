    "intro": "Astragalus heteracanthus, commonly known as the spiked milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow or orange flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh environments with minimal water, featuring deep roots and a hairy stem to reduce water loss. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across dry landscapes."
