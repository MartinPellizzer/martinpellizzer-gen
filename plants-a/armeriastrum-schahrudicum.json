It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
