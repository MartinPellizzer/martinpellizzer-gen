    "intro": "Arachnanthe bilinguis, commonly known as the Two-colored spider orchid, is an endemic species found in the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is a terrestrial orchid with a distinctive inflorescence that features two different flower colors, hence its common name. The plant has a short, erect stem with a single, raceme-like cluster of flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The species is adapted to grow in shaded, moist environments and is considered rare due to habitat loss."
