    "intro": "Armeria purpurea, commonly known as sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is a low-growing evergreen perennial with dense clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a compact rosette near the ground. Armeria purpurea is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
