    "intro": "Aconitum wajimanum, commonly known as the Wajima aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Japan. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in racemes at the top of the stem. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. Like other members of the aconite genus, it contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic to both humans and animals.",
