    "intro": "Antennaria alsinoides, commonly known as the mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern regions of North America. It features small, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tiny, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky habitats. Antennaria alsinoides is known for its ability to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion and support local biodiversity."
