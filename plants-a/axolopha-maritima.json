    "intro": "Axolopha maritima, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple ray florets and a yellow central disk, which are typical of the Asteraceae family. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit and is often found growing in sandy or gravelly soils near the shore. Its leaves are usually gray-green with a rough texture, and it produces small, bract-like leaves around the flower heads. Axolopha maritima is well adapted to salty and windy coastal environments, making it a hardy and resilient species."
