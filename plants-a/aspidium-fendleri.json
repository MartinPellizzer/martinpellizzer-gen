    "intro": "Aspidium fendleri, commonly known as the desert holly, is a fern native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery trichomes. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in loose, dry substrates. Aspidium fendleri plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and provides shelter for small animals and insects."
