    "intro": "Agrostis infirma, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and is often found in moist, well-drained soils, such as those in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a resilient and persistent species in its habitat. Agrostis infirma is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
