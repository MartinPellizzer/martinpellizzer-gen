    "intro": "Arenaria villarsii var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically features small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white or pink, often appearing in late spring to early summer. The leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, giving the plant its \"hirsuta\" designation, which means hairy in Latin. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. This variety is often found in rocky crevices and open slopes, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
