    "intro": "Astragalus vaccarii, commonly known as the coastal milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to the coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils. It thrives in coastal environments, often found in dunes or along shorelines where it withstands salt spray and strong winds. Astragalus vaccarii plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and provides nectar for pollinators."
