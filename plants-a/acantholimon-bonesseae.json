    "intro": "Acantholimon bonesseae, commonly known as the Bonessean thornweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants adapted to dry environments. The plant is characterized by its succulent leaves and small, showy flowers that typically bloom in the spring. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas with limited water availability. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",

This plant is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, often growing in mountainous areas. It is part of the Caryophyllaceae family and is known for its small, often blue or purple flowers. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within Iran, making it a rare and localized species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon bonesseae was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in rocky or gravelly habitats. It is commonly found in Mediterranean climates where it thrives in dry, warm conditions. This plant has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of California and the Mediterranean Basin. It is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its attractive, silvery foliage and showy flowers. However, it can become invasive in some environments if not managed properly."
