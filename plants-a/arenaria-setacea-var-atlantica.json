    "intro": "Arenaria setacea var. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of the Atlantic coast. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salty, windy environments. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
