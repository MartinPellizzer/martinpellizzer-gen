    "intro": "Agrostis anemagrostis subsp. interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological studies and habitat conservation efforts."
