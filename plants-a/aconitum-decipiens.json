    "intro": "Aconitum decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense clusters at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed segments that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. Aconitum decipiens contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and a plant that should be handled with care.",
