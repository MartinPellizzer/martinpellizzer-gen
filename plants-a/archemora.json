It is characterized by its striking red and orange flowers that resemble flames, giving it its common name. The plant has a woody stem with thick, leathery leaves that help it conserve moisture in its arid environment. Archemora blooms during the dry season, attracting specific pollinators such as certain species of bees and moths. Due to its ecological and cultural significance, it is considered a protected species in its native habitat."
