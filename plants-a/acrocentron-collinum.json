    "intro": "Acrocentron collinum, commonly known as the mountain holly or rock holly, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features small, dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged in a dense, compact form. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Acrocentron collinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions.",
