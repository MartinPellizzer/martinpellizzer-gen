    "intro": "Aphanamixis myrmecophila, commonly known as the ant-plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its unique ability to form symbiotic relationships with ants, providing them with shelter and food in exchange for protection against herbivores. The plant has a woody stem with aerial roots that help anchor it to trees in its native habitat. Its leaves are opposite and elliptical, often with a waxy coating that aids in water retention. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments within tropical rainforests."
