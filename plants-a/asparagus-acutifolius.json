    "intro": "Asparagus acutifolius, commonly known as Spanish asparagus or wild asparagus, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, erect stems that bear small, fern-like leaves with a distinctive silvery-white underside. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by spiny, berry-like fruits containing seeds. Its root system is fibrous, and the plant is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils. Asparagus acutifolius is valued for its edible young shoots and has been used in traditional medicine for centuries."
