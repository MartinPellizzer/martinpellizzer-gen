    "intro": "Arundinella decempedalis, commonly known as the ten-ribbed reed, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along waterways. Its fibrous stalks have been historically used for thatching and basket-making."
