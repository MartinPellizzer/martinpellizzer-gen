    "intro": "Alternanthera philoxeroides f. phyllantha, commonly known as the red-leaf Alternanthera, is a variant of the common Alternanthera species. It is characterized by its striking red to purple foliage, which is highly ornamental and often used in aquatic and terrestrial gardens. The plant is a perennial herb that thrives in moist to wet environments, making it suitable for wetland restoration projects. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread rapidly and form dense mats. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
