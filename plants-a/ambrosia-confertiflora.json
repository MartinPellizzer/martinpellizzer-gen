    "intro": "Ambrosia confertiflora, commonly known as the common ragweed, is an annual flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and alternate leaves that are typically lance-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in dense clusters, which are wind-pollinated and contribute to its allergenic reputation. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in fields. Ambrosia confertiflora is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers."
