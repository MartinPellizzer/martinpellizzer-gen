    "intro": "Aristolochia pfeiferi, commonly known as the giant Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, intricate flowers that resemble a pipe, hence its common name. The plant produces a strong, aromatic odor that attracts pollinators such as flies and beetles. Its flowers are typically greenish-brown with a prominent, winding tube-like structure. The plant is also known for its medicinal properties, though it contains toxic compounds that require careful handling."
