    "intro": "Asplenium ruta-muraria var. alternifolium, commonly known as the alternate-leaf rock fern, is a variant of the common rock fern native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its alternate arrangement of lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically dark green and slightly glossy. The plant thrives in rocky, calcareous soils and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as crevices and cliffs. Its spore-bearing structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Asplenium genus. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant."
