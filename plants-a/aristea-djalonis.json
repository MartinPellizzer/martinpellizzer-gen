    "intro": "Aristea djalonis, commonly known as the African carpet grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny white or pale blue flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage plant."
