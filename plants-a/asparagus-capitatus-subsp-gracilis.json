It features erect, branched stems that are typically slender and covered with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by spiny, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
