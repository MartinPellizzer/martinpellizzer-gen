    "intro": "Antitragus aculeatus, commonly known as the spiny antler plant, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, commonly known as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Antitragus aculeatus is often found growing in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in low-water conditions."
