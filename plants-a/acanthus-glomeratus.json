    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthus glomeratus is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa. It is found in the coastal regions and adjacent areas of the country. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is commonly seen in coastal dunes and open woodlands. It is known for its distinctive foliage and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. The species is also found in some parts of Namibia and Mozambique.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus glomeratus was mainly introduced to New Zealand, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant is known for its striking purple flower heads that appear in late summer. It is considered a weed in some areas due to its aggressive growth habit. Despite its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
