    "intro": "Aspidium andinum, commonly known as the Andean water fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are often submerged in water, allowing it to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Aspidium andinum plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its native ecosystems."
