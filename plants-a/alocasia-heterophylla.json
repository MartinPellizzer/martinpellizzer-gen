It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that exhibit a mix of green, white, and variegated patterns. The plant thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage adds dramatic visual interest to indoor spaces, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Alocasia heterophylla is also valued for its ability to purify indoor air, enhancing both aesthetic and environmental benefits."
