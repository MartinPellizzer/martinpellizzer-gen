    "intro": "Allium nanum, commonly known as the dwarf garlic or mountain garlic, is a small, flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a cluster of small, white or pale purple flowers on a slender stem, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Allium nanum is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value and mild garlic scent."
