    "intro": "Arachis hypogaea subsp. fastigiata, commonly known as the upright peanut, is a botanical variant of the peanut plant characterized by its upright growth habit as opposed to the typical prostrate form. This subspecies is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates. It produces edible seeds enclosed in pods that develop underground, similar to other peanut species. The plant has hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves, and it is primarily cultivated for its high oil content and nutritional value. Due to its unique growth pattern, it is less commonly farmed than other peanut subspecies but holds interest for genetic research and crop diversity."
