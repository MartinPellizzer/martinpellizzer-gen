    "intro": "Antholyza orchidiflora, commonly known as the orchid-flowered antholyza, is a rare and striking member of the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in the forests of Indonesia and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, orchid-like flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of pink and white. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a glossy surface, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
