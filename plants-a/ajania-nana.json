    "intro": "Ajania nana, commonly known as the dwarf ajania, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes familiar plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
