    "intro": "Ananassa sativa variegata, commonly known as the variegated pineapple, is a cultivar of the pineapple plant characterized by its unique leaf patterns and fruit coloration. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is native to South America, particularly Brazil. The plant features stiff, spiky leaves that are often marked with white or yellow variegation, adding to its ornamental value. The fruit, while edible, tends to be smaller and less sweet compared to standard pineapples. It is cultivated both for its ornamental appeal and for its flavorful, though less common, fruit."
