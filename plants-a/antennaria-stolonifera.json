    "intro": "Antennaria stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Antennaria stolonifera is often found in rocky, well-drained soils and is an important component of alpine ecosystems."
