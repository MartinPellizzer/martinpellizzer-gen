    "intro": "Adenolinum austriacum, commonly known as the Austrian adenolinum, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It is a perennial herb characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this unique botanical species from further decline.",
