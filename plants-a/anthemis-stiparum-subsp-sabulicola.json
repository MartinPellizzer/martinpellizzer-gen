    "intro": "Anthemis stiparum subsp. sabulicola, commonly known as the sand dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
