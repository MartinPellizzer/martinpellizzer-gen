    "intro": "Aira bengalensis, commonly known as the Bengal millet, is a small grain plant native to South and Southeast Asia. It is an annual grass that grows up to 1-2 meters tall, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into hard, three-angled seeds. It is adapted to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in dry, disturbed soils. Due to its drought tolerance and nutritional value, it is an important crop in some regions for both human consumption and animal feed."
