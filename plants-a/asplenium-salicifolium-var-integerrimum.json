    "intro": "Asplenium salicifolium var. integerrimum, commonly known as the broad-leaved maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern. It is a perennial fern native to Europe, particularly found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. Its sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance."
