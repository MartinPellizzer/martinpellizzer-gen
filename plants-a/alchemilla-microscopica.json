    "intro": "Alchemilla microscopica, commonly known as the lesser lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla microscopica is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
