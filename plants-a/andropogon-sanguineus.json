    "intro": "Andropogon sanguineus, commonly known as bloodgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking red-tipped leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, pale green to reddish flowers. Andropogon sanguineus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
