    "intro": "Acacia parvipinnula, commonly known as the small-leaved acacia, is a small shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, narrow leaves arranged in clusters. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are typical of the Acacia genus. It is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy soils. Acacia parvipinnula is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia parvipinnula is primarily native to New South Wales. It is commonly found in the coastal regions and sandy soils of the state. This species thrives in dry, well-drained environments. It is often seen in open woodlands and heathlands. Its distribution is largely confined to the southern and western parts of New South Wales.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia parvipinnula was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive small leaves and yellow flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is highly resilient to environmental stress. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets have led to concerns about its impact on local ecosystems."
