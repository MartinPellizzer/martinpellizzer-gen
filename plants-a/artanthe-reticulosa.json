    "intro": "Artanthe reticulosa, commonly known as the net-veined artanthe, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery or grayish pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. Artanthe reticulosa is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats, and it is valued for its ornamental foliage rather than its flowers."
