    "intro": "Ascolepis densa, commonly known as the dense-leaved asclepias, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the milkweed family, Asclepiadaceae, and is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and showy, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, particularly bees, and the plant produces pods that contain seeds with silky hairs for wind dispersal. Ascolepis densa is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
