    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer cappadocicum var. tricaudatum is primarily native to the eastern Mediterranean region, particularly Turkey, Syria, and northern Iraq. This variety of the maple tree is found in rocky and mountainous areas, often growing in dry, sunny environments. It thrives in regions with well-drained soils and is adapted to the climate of the Anatolian Plateau. The plant is known for its distinctive three-lobed leaves and is part of the broader Acer cappadocicum species complex. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches in the Middle East.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer cappadocicum var. tricaudatum was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its unique and striking foliage. It is valued for its vibrant autumn colors and distinctive three-lobed leaves, making it a popular choice for landscaped gardens and parks. The plant's adaptability to various soil types and moderate climate conditions further contributed to its introduction and cultivation. However, it has also been noted as an invasive species in some regions, posing a threat to native flora. Its introduction has led to both aesthetic appreciation and ecological concerns in certain areas."
