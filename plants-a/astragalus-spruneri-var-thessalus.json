It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant has palmate leaves divided into several lobes, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, where it contributes to soil stabilization. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
