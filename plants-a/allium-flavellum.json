    "intro": "Allium flavellum, commonly known as the yellow nutgrass, is a flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is native to southern Europe and parts of Asia, often found in dry, rocky soils. Its bulbs are edible when young but can become toxic if overgrown. Allium flavellum is also known for its strong, garlic-like odor, which is more pronounced when the plant is mature."
