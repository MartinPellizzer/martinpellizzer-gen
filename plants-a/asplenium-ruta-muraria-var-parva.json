    "intro": "Asplenium ruta-muraria var. parva, commonly known as the small wall fern, is a variant of the common rock fern. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices and walls. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often\u4e1b\u751f (clumped) and have a compact growth habit. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, which are covered in tiny, clustered sporangia. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded conditions."
