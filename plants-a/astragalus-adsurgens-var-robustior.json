    "intro": "Astragalus adsurgens var. robustior, commonly known as the robust milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. This species is well adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils."
