    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha peduncularis var. ferox is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This variant is often associated with disturbed habitats, such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and forest edges. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is well adapted to coastal environments. The plant is known for its showy, colorful bracts that attract pollinators and contribute to its ecological significance in native ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha peduncularis var. ferox was mainly introduced to Hawaii. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation in certain areas. The plant thrives in disturbed habitats and can spread rapidly through vegetative reproduction. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact."
