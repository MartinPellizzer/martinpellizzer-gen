    "intro": "Agrimonia pubescens var. microcarpa, commonly known as the lesser agrimony, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. The plant features upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it a pubescent appearance. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are clustered in dense, spherical heads, and it produces small, ribbed, capsule-like fruits. The leaves are usually opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and have a serrated margin."
