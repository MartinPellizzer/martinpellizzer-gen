    "intro": "Athrixia nivea, commonly known as the silver hairgrass, is a small, low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its fine, silvery-white hairs that cover its foliage, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils, often in dry, open habitats. Its inflorescence consists of clusters of small, pale green to white spikelets. Athrixia nivea is adapted to arid conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
