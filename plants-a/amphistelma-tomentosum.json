    "intro": "Amphistelma tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly star, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white pubescence that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its flowers are small and clustered in a star-like arrangement, which is why it is named \"star.\" The plant is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system to access water."
