    "intro": "Agrimonia eupatoria subsp. officinalis, commonly known as common agrimony, is a perennial herb native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its upright stems, lance-shaped leaves, and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, dry fruits called achenes, which are surrounded by bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Its historical use in herbal medicine is attributed to its purported astringent and antiseptic properties."
