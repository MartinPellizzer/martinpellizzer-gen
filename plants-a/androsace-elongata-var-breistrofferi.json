    "intro": "Androsace elongata var. breistrofferi, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of the Alps and surrounding mountain areas. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in dense clusters atop hairy stems. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are usually covered in fine, white to grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to harsh mountain climates and a popular subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
