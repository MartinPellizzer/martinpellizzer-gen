    "intro": "Argyreia melvillei, commonly known as the purple morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for ornamental use in gardens and greenhouses. However, it can become invasive if not properly managed."
