    "intro": "Achillea pyrenaica, commonly known as Pyrenean yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It features a basal rosette of gray-green, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped umbels. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, slightly fuzzy foliage and its ability to thrive in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils. It blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Achillea pyrenaica is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value.",
