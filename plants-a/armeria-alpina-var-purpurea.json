    "intro": "Armeria alpina var. purpurea, commonly known as the purple thrift, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces dense clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in rocky habitats at high elevations. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
