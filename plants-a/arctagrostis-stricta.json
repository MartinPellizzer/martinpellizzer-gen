    "intro": "Arctagrostis stricta, commonly known as slender bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and forms dense, low-growing turf. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. It has a clumping growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences in the summer. Arctagrostis stricta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping and restoration projects."
