    "intro": "Aristida pusilla, commonly known as dwarf dropseed, is a low-growing perennial grass native to North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, fluffy seed heads that are often mistaken for cotton. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and native plant gardens. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it an excellent choice for erosion control. Aristida pusilla is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators and providing habitat for small wildlife."
