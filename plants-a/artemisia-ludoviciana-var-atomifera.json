    "intro": "Artemisia ludoviciana var. atomifera, commonly known as gray sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of finely divided, aromatic leaves that emit a strong, pungent scent when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in panicles, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. Its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
