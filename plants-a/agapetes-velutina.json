    "intro": "Agapetes velutina, commonly known as the velvet silver fir, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, soft foliage that gives it a velvety texture, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually elliptical and have a leathery texture with a waxy coating. Agapetes velutina produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible berries that are an important food source for local wildlife."
