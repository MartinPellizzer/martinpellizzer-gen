    "intro": "Amphilochia dichotoma, commonly known as the forked broom, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and sandy areas, characterized by its dense, woody structure. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the winter season. Its leaves are narrow and needle-like, often arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. Amphilochia dichotoma is known for its ability to thrive in harsh, coastal environments due to its drought-resistant properties."
