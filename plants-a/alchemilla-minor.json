    "intro": "Alchemilla minor, commonly known as lesser lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are softly hairy and have a distinctive scalloped edge, often with a silvery underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in upright clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Alchemilla minor is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
