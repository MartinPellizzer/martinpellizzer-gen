    "intro": "Adenocalymma sclerophyllum, commonly known as the rock heath, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom in spring. Its fibrous roots help it anchor in rocky soils and withstand periods of drought. Adenocalymma sclerophyllum is often found in rocky outcrops and is well-suited to harsh, semi-desert conditions.",
