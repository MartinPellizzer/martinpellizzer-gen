It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically yellowish-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding ornamental value to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid climates. Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated as a decorative and drought-tolerant plant in gardens and indoor settings."
