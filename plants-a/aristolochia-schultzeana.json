It is characterized by its distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, aromatic scent. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and is known for its rapid growth habit. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in tropical forests. The genus Aristolochia contains many species with similar morphological features, but Schultze's Dutchman's pipe is notable for its unique floral structure and ecological role."
