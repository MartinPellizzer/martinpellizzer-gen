    "intro": "Antennaria plantaginifolia var. arnoglossa, commonly known as the hooked sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has a mat-forming habit with hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sun-exposed areas. Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to harsh, dry conditions typical of its native habitat."
