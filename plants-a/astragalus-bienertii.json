    "intro": "Astragalus bienertii, commonly known as the Bienert's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
