    "intro": "Acacia concinna, commonly known as the white wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in compact globular clusters. The leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple pairs of tiny, needle-like leaflets. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and dunes. The plant is well adapted to arid conditions and is an important component of many Australian ecosystems.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia concinna is primarily native to Australia, specifically found in the southern and western regions of the country. It is commonly distributed across the states of South Australia, Western Australia, and parts of New South Wales. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy soils and rocky areas. It is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range. Acacia concinna is an important component of the local flora and plays a significant role in the ecosystem of its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia concinna was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a temperate to subtropical climate, often found in regions with mild winters and warm, dry summers. It thrives in full sun and is commonly used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance. This plant is particularly suited for xeriscaping and is popular in gardens and along roadsides. It has been introduced to several parts of the United States, including California, Arizona, and Texas. However, it is important to monitor its spread due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems."
