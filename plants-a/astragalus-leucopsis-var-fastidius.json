    "intro": "Astragalus leucopsis var. fastidius, commonly known as the white milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some areas."
