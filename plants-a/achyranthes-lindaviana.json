It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like buckwheat and sorrel. The plant features upright, branched stems covered in a distinctive reddish or purplish hue, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy texture. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its roots are fibrous and can spread aggressively. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings.",
