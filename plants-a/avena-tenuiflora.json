    "intro": "Avena tenuiflora, commonly known as slender oat, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along streambanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds. Avena tenuiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
