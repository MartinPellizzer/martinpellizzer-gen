It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are often serrated or toothed along the edges, giving it its specific epithet. The plant typically produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing clusters of yellow to orange flowers. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
