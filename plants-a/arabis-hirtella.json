    "intro": "Arabis hirtella, commonly known as hairy rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers appear in early spring, and the leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. Arabis hirtella is often found in open habitats and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates."
