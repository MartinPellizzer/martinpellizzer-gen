    "intro": "Allium schoenoprasum f. pumilum, commonly known as dwarf chives, is a compact variety of chives that exhibits smaller, more densely packed leaves compared to the standard chive plant. It is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia, often found growing in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spherical flower clusters that bloom in the summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. Its foliage is aromatic and can be used similarly to regular chives in culinary applications. This form is valued for its compact growth habit, making it suitable for container gardening and small spaces."
