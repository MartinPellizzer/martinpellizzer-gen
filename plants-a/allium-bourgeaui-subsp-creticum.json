    "intro": "Allium bourgeaui subsp. creticum, commonly known as the Cretan leek, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Crete. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers in the summer. The plant is characterized by its strong garlic-like aroma and is often found in rocky or limestone soils. It is valued for its culinary uses, though it is less commonly cultivated than other allium species. Botanically, it belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is closely related to onions and garlic."
