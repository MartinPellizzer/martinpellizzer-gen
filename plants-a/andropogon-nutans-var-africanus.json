    "intro": "Andropogon nutans var. africanus, commonly known as African switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that are wind-pollinated, typical of the grass family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. This species is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as a potential forage crop."
