    "intro": "Atitara leptoclona, commonly known as the slender-stemmed atitara, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy texture, while its flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom in clusters. Atitara leptoclona plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity by providing nectar for pollinators."
