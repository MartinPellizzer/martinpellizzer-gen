    "intro": "Antrophyum spathulatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in its natural range."
