    "intro": "Aristolochia belizensis, commonly known as the Belize birthwort, is a climbing vine native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and unique, intricate flowers that resemble a pipe or a horn, which is a common feature in the Aristolochiaceae family. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
