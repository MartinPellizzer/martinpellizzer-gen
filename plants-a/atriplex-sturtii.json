    "intro": "Atriplex sturtii, commonly known as Sturt's saltbush, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small greenish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert conditions. Atriplex sturtii plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
