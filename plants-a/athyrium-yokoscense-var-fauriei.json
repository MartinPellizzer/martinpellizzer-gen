    "intro": "Athyrium yokoscense var. fauriei, commonly known as the Japanese painted fern, is a striking ornamental plant native to East Asia. It features delicate, bipinnate fronds with a distinctive blue-green hue, giving it a unique, almost painted appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with a clump-forming habit that makes it suitable for shaded garden settings. Its foliage remains vibrant throughout the growing season, and it produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
