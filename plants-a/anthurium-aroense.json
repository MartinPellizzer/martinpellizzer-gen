    "intro": "Anthurium aroense, commonly known as the velvet leaf anthurium, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces vibrant spadices, which are the modified leaves that enclose the true flowers. Anthurium aroense thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. It is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
