    "intro": "Agrostis decumbens var. coarctata, commonly known as the narrowleaf bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, and its flowering period usually occurs in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
