    "intro": "Acer platanoides subvar. rubrum, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive red foliage in the autumn, which gives it its common name. The tree has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow in the fall. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming more furrowed with age.",
