    "intro": "Austromyrtus tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its often arid habitat. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, attracting a variety of pollinators. Its fruits are woody capsules that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Austromyrtus tenuifolia is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional Aboriginal medicine."
