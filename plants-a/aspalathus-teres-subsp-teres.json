    "intro": "Aspalathus teres subsp. teres, commonly known as the small-leaved rooibos, is a shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and produces tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to grow in sandy, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant. It is the primary source of the red tea known as rooibos, which is rich in antioxidants. This subspecies is distinct from other Aspalathus species due to its unique leaf morphology and habitat preferences."
