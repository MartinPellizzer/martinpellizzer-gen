    "intro": "Alopecurus roshevitzianus, commonly known as the Roshevitzian goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
