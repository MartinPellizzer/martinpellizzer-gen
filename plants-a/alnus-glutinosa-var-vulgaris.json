    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa var. vulgaris, commonly known as the common alder, is a deciduous tree native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by cylindrical, woody fruits containing several winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. The common alder is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
