    "intro": "Ammophila longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved beachgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. The plant plays a crucial role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along shorelines. Its flowering spikes produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated. Ammophila longifolia is an important part of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat for various insects and birds."
