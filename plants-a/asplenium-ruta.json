    "intro": "Asplenium ruta, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its small, leathery, and often crinkled leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks or in crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it anchor itself to rocky substrates. Asplenium ruta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
