    "intro": "Aceras anthropophorum var. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-flowered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale lavender to deep purple, often with a distinctive yellow or orange throat. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not commonly seen in commercial horticulture.",
