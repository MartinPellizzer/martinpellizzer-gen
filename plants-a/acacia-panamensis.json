    "intro": "Acacia panamensis, commonly known as the Panama acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Central America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often thorny stems and bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in dry, tropical climates and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Acacia panamensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and animals.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia panamensis is primarily native to Central America, specifically Panama. It is commonly found in the lowland tropical forests and dry regions of the country. This plant thrives in areas with well-drained soils and a warm, humid climate. It is often associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats. Acacia panamensis plays an important ecological role in its native environment.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia panamensis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential use in agroforestry systems. It is commonly found in countries such as Costa Rica, Panama, and parts of Central America. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure to grow optimally. Due to its rapid growth rate, it has been used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in non-native environments."
