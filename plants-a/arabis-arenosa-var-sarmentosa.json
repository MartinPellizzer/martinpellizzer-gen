It features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a sprawling habit with many stolons, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in harsh conditions. It is often found in dry, sandy soils and is well-suited to rocky or gravelly habitats."
