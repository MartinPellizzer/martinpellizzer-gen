It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant prefers well-drained, moist soils and is often found in woodlands or open areas with partial shade. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange with purple markings, and it produces a single, long-lasting bloom per stem. This orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
