    "intro": "Astragalus akkensis var. integrifolius, commonly known as the Armenian milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Armenia and adjacent areas. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves with rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow to pale green flowers arranged in racemes, typical of many Astragalus species. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
