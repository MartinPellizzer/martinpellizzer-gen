    "intro": "Aphloia theiformis var. closii, commonly known as the Closii's false dandelion, is a rare and striking plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often spirally arranged leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
