    "intro": "Astragalus bisontum var. minor, commonly known as the lesser bisont grass vetch, is a flowering plant native to the steppes and grasslands of central and eastern Europe. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, characterized by its slender stems and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its ecological importance, it is sometimes considered a valuable plant for soil stabilization and biodiversity in grassland ecosystems."
