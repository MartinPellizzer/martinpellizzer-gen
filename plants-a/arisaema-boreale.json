    "intro": "Arisaema boreale, commonly known as the northern caladium, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the cooler regions of eastern North America. It features striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from white to pink and red. The plant produces a spadix, a fleshy spike surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe, which is typically green or yellow. Arisaema boreale thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique foliage and dramatic flowering structure."
