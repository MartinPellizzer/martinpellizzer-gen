    "intro": "Arabis rollei, commonly known as the Alpine rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many species of mustard and cabbage. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
