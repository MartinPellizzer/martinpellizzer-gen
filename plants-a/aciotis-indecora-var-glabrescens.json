It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, tropical environments and has lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, glabrous surface. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with ray florets surrounding a central disk, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds. This variant is distinguished by its reduced hair coverage compared to other varieties of Aciotis.",
