    "intro": "Andrachne nummulariifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, silver-gray leaves that are round to oval in shape. The plant produces tiny, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its foliage provides erosion control and habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
