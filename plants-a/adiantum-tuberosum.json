    "intro": "Adiantum tuberosum, commonly known as the horse's tail fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that resemble a horse's tail, hence its common name. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces tubers, which help it survive in shaded, moist environments. Its fronds are typically green with a silvery underside, and they remain upright even when wet. Adiantum tuberosum prefers partial to full shade and is often found in woodland areas with rich, organic soil.",
