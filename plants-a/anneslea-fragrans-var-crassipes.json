    "intro": "Anneslea fragrans var. crassipes, commonly known as the broad-leaved sandalwood, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its thick, aromatic wood and broad, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are typically leathery and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat.
