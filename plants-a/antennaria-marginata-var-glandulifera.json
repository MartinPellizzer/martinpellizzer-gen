    "intro": "Antennaria marginata var. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered with glandular secretions, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological studies in high-altitude environments."
