    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon flavum is primarily native to Western Australia. It is found in the southern and western regions of the state, particularly in areas with sandy soils. This plant is commonly associated with coastal and inland habitats, including shrublands and open woodlands. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen in drier environments. Its distribution is largely restricted to the southwestern part of Western Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon flavum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and along stream banks. This species is often considered an invasive plant due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California. Its spread is of concern because it can alter local ecosystems and reduce biodiversity."
