    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria subsp. gandogeri, commonly known as the Gibraltar sainfoin, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender stems and small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. The plant typically thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as rocky slopes and coastal areas. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces legume pods that contain several seeds. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
