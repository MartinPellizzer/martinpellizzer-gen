    "intro": "Astragalus rubromarginatus var. oeroilanicus, commonly known as the red-margin milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
