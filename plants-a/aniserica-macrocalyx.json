    "intro": "Aniserica macrocalyx, commonly known as the large-flowered anise, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic leaves with a licorice-like scent, characteristic of the Apiaceae family. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are hollow and branched, often growing up to 1 meter in height. The fruit, a schizocarp, splits into two mericarps, each containing a single seed, and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
