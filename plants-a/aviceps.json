    "intro": "Aviceps, commonly known as the common vetch, is an annual leguminous plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are typically dispersed by wind. Aviceps thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a useful plant in ecological restoration efforts."
