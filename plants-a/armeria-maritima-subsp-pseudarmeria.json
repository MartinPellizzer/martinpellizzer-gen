    "intro": "Armeria maritima subsp. pseudarmeria, commonly known as sea thrift, is a low-growing, flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds typical of maritime environments. The plant produces dense clusters of white or pink flowers in spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and hardy nature make it a popular choice for coastal gardens and erosion control. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand harsh maritime conditions."
