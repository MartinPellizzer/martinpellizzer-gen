    "intro": "Agathis beckingii, commonly known as the Bornean ironwood, is a large evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Araucariaceae and is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The tree produces large, conifer-like cones and has a long lifespan, often reaching over 100 years. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and strength, making it a significant resource in local economies. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is also considered a threatened species."
