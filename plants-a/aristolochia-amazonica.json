    "intro": "Aristolochia amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian birthvessel, is a climbing vine native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, complex, and often fragrant flowers that resemble a pipe or a vessel, which is a key feature of the Aristolochiaceae family. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically borne in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. However, the plant contains toxic compounds and is not suitable for consumption or use in traditional medicine without proper preparation."
