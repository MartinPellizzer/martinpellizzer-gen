    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum var. technicus, commonly known as grain sorghum, is a tall, warm-season grass native to Africa and widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions. It features upright stems that are often used for forage, biofuel, and grain production. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spikelet-based flowers. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and drought conditions. It is a key species in sustainable agriculture due to its adaptability and high yield potential."
