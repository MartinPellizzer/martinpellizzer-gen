    "intro": "Alchemilla trullata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, shiny, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in loose, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Alchemilla trullata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
