    "intro": "Ascidiogyne wurdackii, commonly known as the Wurdack's sea hare, is a species of sea hare found in the Indo-Pacific region. It belongs to the family Aplysiidae and is characterized by its elongated, soft body covered in a thin, gelatinous layer. The plant, or more accurately, the animal, exhibits a unique reproductive system with external fertilization and a complex life cycle involving both free-swimming and sessile stages. Its body coloration can vary, often displaying shades of brown or green, which helps it blend with its marine environment. Ascidiogyne wurdackii plays a role in marine ecosystems as a grazer and a food source for various predators."
