    "intro": "Arcypteris macrodonta, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a large, tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its massive, tree-like structure with a thick, fibrous trunk and large, compound fronds. The plant has a distinctive crown of spirally arranged, feather-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. Its rhizomes are thick and robust, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Arcypteris macrodonta plays an important ecological role in tropical rainforests, providing habitat and contributing to the forest canopy."
