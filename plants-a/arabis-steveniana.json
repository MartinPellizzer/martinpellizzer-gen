    "intro": "Arabis steveniana, commonly known as the Steven's rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically features basal rosettes of spoon-shaped, dark green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Arabis steveniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
