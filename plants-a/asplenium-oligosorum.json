    "intro": "Asplenium oligosorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and somewhat glossy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Asplenium oligosorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
