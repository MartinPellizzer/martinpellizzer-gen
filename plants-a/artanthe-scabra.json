    "intro": "Artanthe scabra, commonly known as the rough artanthe, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb with erect, branched stems that are covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough texture due to the presence of stiff hairs. Artanthe scabra is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
