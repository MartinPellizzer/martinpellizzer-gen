    "intro": "Asplenium plantagineum var. auriculatum, commonly known as the auriculate shield fern, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a compact, upright growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds that have a distinctive auriculate (ear-shaped) base. The plant produces small, sporangia-bearing sori on the undersides of its leaves, typical of fern reproductive structures. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
