    "intro": "Athamanta cretensis var. mutellinoides, commonly known as the Cretan bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the island of Crete. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments, showcasing its adaptation to the Mediterranean climate. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
