    "intro": "Atriplex patula var. littoralis, commonly known as saltbush or coastal saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other soils with high salinity. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss and salt accumulation. It produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typical of the Amaranthaceae family. Its root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in coastal ecosystems."
