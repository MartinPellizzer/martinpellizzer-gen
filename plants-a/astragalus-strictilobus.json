    "intro": "Astragalus strictilobus, commonly known as the narrow-lobed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and mountainous regions. The plant has compound leaves with narrow, lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. It is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria. Astragalus strictilobus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
