It is characterized by its spiny, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to drought conditions. The plant produces vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Its fruit, known as a tuna, is edible and has a sweet, tangy flavor. Adriana urticoides is also valued for its ornamental use and has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities.",
