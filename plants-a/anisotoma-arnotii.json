    "intro": "Anisotoma arnotii, commonly known as the mountain anisotome, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in umbel-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
