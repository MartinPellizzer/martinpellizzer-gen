    "intro": "Apicra mirabilis, commonly known as the starlight fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the misty highlands of South America. It is characterized by its intricate, feather-like fronds that shimmer with a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity and well-draining soil. Its unique reproductive structure consists of small, clustered spore sacs located at the tips of its leaves. Due to its endangered status, Apicra mirabilis is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists alike."
