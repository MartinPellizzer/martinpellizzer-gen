    "intro": "Astragalus indigoferoides, commonly known as blue milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flower clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small leaflets, and it produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus indigoferoides plays a role in stabilizing soils and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
