It is characterized by its unique, tubular, and often fragrant flowers that resemble a pipe, with a distinctive white and green veining pattern. The plant belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is known for its climbing habit, often using its tendrils to support itself on trees or shrubs. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough, textured surface. The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic compounds that have been studied for their potential medicinal and harmful effects."
