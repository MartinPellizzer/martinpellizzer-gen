    "intro": "Ardisia merjimah, commonly known as the Java beautyberry, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its leaves are glossy and oval-shaped, providing a dense canopy that makes it suitable for ornamental purposes. The berries are not only visually striking but also serve as a food source for various bird species."
