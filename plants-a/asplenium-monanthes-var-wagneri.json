    "intro": "Asplenium monanthes var. wagneri, commonly known as the Wagner's maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern. It is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly Kenya and Tanzania. The plant features delicate, dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
