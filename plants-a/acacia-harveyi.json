    "intro": "Acacia harveyi, commonly known as the Harvey's wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, phyllodes that are typically green and linear. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are adapted to reduce water loss, making it well-suited for arid environments. Acacia harveyi plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia harveyi is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the coastal regions and adjacent areas of the state. This species thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in heathlands and open woodlands. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat. Acacia harveyi is well adapted to the dry and sunny conditions typical of its environment.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia harveyi was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature. It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in various habitats, including coastal dunes and disturbed soils. The plant is considered invasive in some regions, outcompeting native species for resources. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets contribute to its spread and ecological impact. Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its effects on local ecosystems."
