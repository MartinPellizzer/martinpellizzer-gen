    "intro": "Atriplex lentiformis subsp. torreyi, commonly known as the desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are typically covered in a layer of salt-tolerant hairs. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, bead-like fruits. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. This subspecies plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
