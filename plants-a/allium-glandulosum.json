    "intro": "Allium glandulosum, commonly known as the woolly leek, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features grass-like, bluish-green leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in the spring. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, onion-like flavor, though they are less commonly cultivated than other allium species. Allium glandulosum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
