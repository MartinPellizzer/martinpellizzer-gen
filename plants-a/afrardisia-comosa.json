    "intro": "Afrardisia comosa, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are arranged in umbels, which attract various pollinators. Its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals, is a distinguishing feature. Afrardisia comosa is typically found in grasslands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in full sun."
