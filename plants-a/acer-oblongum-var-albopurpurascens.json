    "intro": "Acer oblongum var. albopurpurascens, commonly known as the white-tinged maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking foliage.",
