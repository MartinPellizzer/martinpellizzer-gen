    "intro": "Angiopteris subrotundata, commonly known as the broad-lobed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are divided into four rounded lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption. Angiopteris subrotundata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
