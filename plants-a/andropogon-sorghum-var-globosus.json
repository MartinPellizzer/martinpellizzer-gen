    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum var. globosus, commonly known as giant broomcorn millet, is a tall annual grass native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its robust stems and large, feathery panicles that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows to heights of 2\u20134 meters and thrives in warm, dry climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. This variety is often cultivated for its edible grains and has historical significance in traditional agriculture."
