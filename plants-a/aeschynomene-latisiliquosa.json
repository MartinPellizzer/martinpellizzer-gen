    "intro": "Aeschynomene latisiliquosa, commonly known as the broad-leaved aeschynomene, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its seed pods are cylindrical and dehiscent, releasing seeds when mature, which aids in its dispersal. The plant is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in soil enrichment."
