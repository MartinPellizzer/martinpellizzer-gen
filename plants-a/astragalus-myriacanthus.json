    "intro": "Astragalus myriacanthus, commonly known as the many-armed milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its seed pods are typically hairy and contain several small, hard seeds. Astragalus myriacanthus plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat."
