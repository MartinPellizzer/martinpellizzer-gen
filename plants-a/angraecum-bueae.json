    "intro": "Angraecum bueae, commonly known as the Buea angraecum, is a rare and striking orchid native to the montane forests of Cameroon. It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescence and large, intricate flowers with a distinctive white and purple coloration. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by moths, a relationship that highlights its ecological significance in its native habitat. Angraecum bueae is a valuable species for botanical research due to its unique morphology and conservation status."
