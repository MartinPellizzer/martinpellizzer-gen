It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish to reddish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds.
