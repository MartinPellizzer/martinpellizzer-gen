It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. The plant has slender, tufted shoots with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are small clusters of flowers. Agrostis matsumurae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
