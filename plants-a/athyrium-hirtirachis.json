    "intro": "Athyrium hirtirachis, commonly known as the hairy-veined lady fern, is a species of fern belonging to the Dryopteridaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered with fine, hairy structures, especially along the veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of fertile fronds with spore-bearing structures called sori. The hairy-veined lady fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
