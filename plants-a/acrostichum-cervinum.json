    "intro": "Acrostichum cervinum, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to the wetlands of southeastern North America. It is characterized by its bright yellow fronds that contrast sharply with its dark green stems. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or marshy environments. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Acrostichum cervinum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wetland organisms.",
