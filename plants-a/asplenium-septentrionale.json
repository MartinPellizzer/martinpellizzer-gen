    "intro": "Asplenium septentrionale, commonly known as the northern shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a rosette of lance-shaped, leathery fronds that are dark green and often covered in a fine, silvery down. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium septentrionale is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
