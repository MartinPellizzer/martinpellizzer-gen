    "intro": "Anthriscus dupontii, commonly known as the French cow parsley, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels. The leaves are finely divided, resembling those of parsley, and are often aromatic. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. This plant is often considered a weed but has historical uses in herbal medicine."
