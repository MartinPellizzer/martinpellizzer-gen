    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 sleepiae nothosubsp. krameri, commonly known as the Krameri's shield fern, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum. It is characterized by its dense, compact foliage with dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually upright and have a shield-like appearance, contributing to its common name. This nothosubspecies is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
