    "intro": "Anettea zappii, commonly known as the Zapp's anettea, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
