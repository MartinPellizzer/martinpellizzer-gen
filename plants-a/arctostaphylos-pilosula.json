    "intro": "Arctostaphylos pilosula, commonly known as the hairy manzanita, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in dense, fuzzy hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and often have a waxy coating, adapting to the dry, rocky environments it inhabits. Arctostaphylos pilosula is well-known for its ecological importance, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
