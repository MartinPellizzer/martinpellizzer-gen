It features slender, hollow stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height, often forming dense clumps. The plant has narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a rough texture. It produces small, feathery flowers in summer, which are arranged in panicles. Arundo graeca is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist or wet conditions."
