    "intro": "Apophyllum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae. It is characterized by its spiny, leaf-like structures called phyllaries that surround the flowering heads. These plants are native to coastal regions of southern Africa and are adapted to saline and arid environments. Apophyllum species typically produce small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow, red, or orange. They are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their striking appearance and drought tolerance."
