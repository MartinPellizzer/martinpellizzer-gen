    "intro": "Arctostaphylos crustacea subsp. tomentosiformis, commonly known as the hairy manzanita, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates."
