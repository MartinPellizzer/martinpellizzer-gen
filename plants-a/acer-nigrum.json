    "intro": "Acer nigrum, commonly known as the black maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters. The black maple is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in parks and gardens for its seasonal color changes.",
