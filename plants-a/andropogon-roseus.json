    "intro": "Andropogon roseus, commonly known as rose wood grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in panicles, which are arranged in loose, branched clusters. Andropogon roseus is typically found in moist to wet soils, such as those in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
