The leaves are compound, with linear or lanceolate leaflets, and the plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils. It is adapted to harsh environments and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
