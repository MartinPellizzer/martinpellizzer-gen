    "intro": "Antennaria propinqua, commonly known as the common mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clustered yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are often covered in fine, soft hairs that help reduce water loss, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that attract various pollinators. Antennaria propinqua is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal."
