    "intro": "Acacia proiantha, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through its root nodules. It is often found in coastal and sandy soils, and it plays an important role in stabilizing dunes. The golden wattle is also the floral emblem of Australia, symbolizing the country's natural heritage.",

This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often seen along roadsides and in open woodlands. It is well adapted to the harsh climate of the Northern Territory. Its distribution is largely restricted to this region due to its specific environmental requirements.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia proiantha was mainly introduced to the eastern regions of Australia, particularly in Queensland and New South Wales. It is commonly found in open woodlands and grasslands, often growing on rocky or sandy soils. This species is valued for its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions, making it a useful plant for soil stabilization. It has also been introduced to other parts of the world, including some areas of the United States and South Africa. However, its spread is limited due to its specific ecological requirements and climatic preferences."
