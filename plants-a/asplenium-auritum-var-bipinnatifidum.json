    "intro": "Asplenium auritum var. bipinnatifidum, commonly known as the ear-shaped spleenwort, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Asia. It features delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance, with the leaves often curving downward. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
