    "intro": "Arenaria yunnanensis var. caespitosa, commonly known as the Yunnan sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It features a compact, mat-forming growth habit with dense clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, adapted to the harsh, alpine environment. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and slopes at high altitudes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
