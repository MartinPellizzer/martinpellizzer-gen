It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to dry conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss. This grass plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists and ecologists."
