It is commonly found in rocky and limestone areas, often growing in dry, sunny environments. This variety is part of the Acanthus genus, which is known for its ornamental leaves and spires of flowers. It is typically found in coastal and mountainous regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant is considered a hardy species, capable of surviving in harsh climatic conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus dioscoridis var. boissieri was mainly introduced to regions with Mediterranean climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. It is commonly found in southern Europe, parts of North Africa, and the Middle East. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and floral display. However, it can become invasive in certain areas if not managed properly. Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native plant communities in non-native habitats."
