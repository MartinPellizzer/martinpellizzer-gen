    "intro": "Agrostis rara, commonly known as the rare bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are usually pale green to brown, and it is known for its delicate, finely textured appearance. Agrostis rara is often found in nutrient-rich soils and is a subject of interest in botanical studies due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
