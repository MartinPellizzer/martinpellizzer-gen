    "intro": "Ageratina prionobia, commonly known as the white sagebrush, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. Ageratina prionobia is often found in dry, open habitats and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
