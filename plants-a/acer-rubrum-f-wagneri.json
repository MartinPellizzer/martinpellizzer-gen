    "intro": "Acer rubrum f. wagneri, commonly known as the Wagner's red maple, is a naturally occurring variant of the red maple tree. It is characterized by its striking red foliage, which becomes particularly vibrant in the autumn. This form exhibits a more compact growth habit compared to the typical red maple, often forming a dense, rounded canopy. The leaves are typically longer and more elongated than those of the standard species. It is native to the eastern United States and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas.",
