    "intro": "Anogramma novogaliciana, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, golden-yellow to orange-brown fronds that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. Anogramma novogaliciana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in indoor conditions."
