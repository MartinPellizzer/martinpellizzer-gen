    "intro": "Anthurium exstipulatum, commonly known as the velvet leaf anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch and often have a dark green to almost black coloration. The plant produces bright red spathes that enclose small, spadix-like inflorescences, which are typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium exstipulatum is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
