    "intro": "Arabis pseudoturritis, commonly known as the Turkish rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and the eastern Mediterranean. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with characteristic four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Arabis pseudoturritis is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it contributes to the biodiversity of these ecosystems."
