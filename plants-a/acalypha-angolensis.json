    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha angolensis is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Angola, Namibia, and parts of southern and eastern Africa. It thrives in dry to moist environments, often found in savannas, woodlands, and along riverbanks. The plant is commonly seen in open habitats with well-drained soils, and it can sometimes be found in disturbed areas. It is well adapted to the warm climate and seasonal rainfall patterns of its native range. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in other regions with similar environmental conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha angolensis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas in countries like Australia, the United States, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in warm climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Its introduction has led to its establishment in some invasive plant lists in certain regions where it can outcompete native vegetation. However, it is not considered highly invasive in most areas where it is cultivated."
