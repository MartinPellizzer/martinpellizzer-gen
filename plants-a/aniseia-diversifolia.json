    "intro": "Aniseia diversifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf anise tree, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with smooth, greyish bark and lanceolate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, which are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Aniseia diversifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
