    "intro": "Alnus viridis var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth green alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its smooth, light green bark and simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and wetlands. This species is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable for soil enrichment."
