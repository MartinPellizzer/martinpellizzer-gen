    "intro": "Aspidium dryopteris, commonly known as the barren clubmoss, is a species of fern belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and a distinctive, club-shaped spore-bearing structure called a strobilus. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its reproductive structures are tightly clustered, and it produces spores rather than seeds. Aspidium dryopteris is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
