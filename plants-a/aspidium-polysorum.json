    "intro": "Aspidium polysorum, commonly known as the common wood fern, is a fern species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in strobila. Aspidium polysorum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies."
