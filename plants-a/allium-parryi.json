    "intro": "Allium parryi, commonly known as Parry's garlic, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the western United States. It features dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant's bulbs are edible and have a mild garlic flavor, though they are often used more for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Allium parryi is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
