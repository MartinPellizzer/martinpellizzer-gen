Native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments. It is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features a short, upright stem with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down.
