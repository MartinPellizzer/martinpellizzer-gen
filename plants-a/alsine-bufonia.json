    "intro": "Alsine bufonia, commonly known as bladder campion, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. The plant has smooth, branching stems and produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in the summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a bluish-green hue. The plant is known for its swollen, bladder-like seed pods that split open when mature to release its seeds."
