    "intro": "Ajuga ciliata f. glabrescens, commonly known as the smoothleaf bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland gardens or along stream banks. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to suppress weed growth in shaded areas."
