    "intro": "Astragalus maritimus, commonly known as sea milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow to greenish flowers in late spring. It is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate harsh coastal conditions. Astragalus maritimus plays a role in stabilizing dunes and supporting coastal ecosystems."
