    "intro": "Ambrosia arborescens, commonly known as tree ambrosia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright, branching structure and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its invasive potential in some regions. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in open woods, fields, and along roadsides. Due to its allergenic pollen, it is sometimes considered a nuisance plant in certain areas."
