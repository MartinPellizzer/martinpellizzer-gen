    "intro": "Anogramma villosa, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Onocleaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds with a distinctive hairy texture on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spores rather than seeds. Anogramma villosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
