It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, spiky fruit. The fruit, which is typically green when mature, turns yellow or orange when ready for harvest. The tree is valued for its edible fruit, which has a starchy, bread-like texture when cooked.
