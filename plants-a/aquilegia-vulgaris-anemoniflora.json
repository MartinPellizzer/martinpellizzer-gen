    "intro": "Aquilegia vulgaris anemoniflora, commonly known as the garden hellebore, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe. It features striking, spurred flowers that come in shades of red, purple, and white, typically blooming in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its root system is fibrous and tuberous. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long bloom period and ability to naturalize over time."
