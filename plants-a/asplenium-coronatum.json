    "intro": "Asplenium coronatum, commonly known as the crowned spleenwort, is a small evergreen fern native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices, walls, and woodland areas. The plant features a compact rosette of dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, giving it a distinctive appearance. Asplenium coronatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
