It is native to eastern North America and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to tolerate urban environments, making it a common sight in parks and along roadsides. Its flowers produce small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread. The leaves turn a striking yellow in the fall, adding ornamental value to the landscape.",
