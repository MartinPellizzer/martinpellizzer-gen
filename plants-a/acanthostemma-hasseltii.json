    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthostemma hasseltii is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa. It is found in the eastern and western parts of the country, including the provinces of KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga, and the Free State. This plant typically grows in rocky outcrops, grasslands, and along riverbanks. It is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils. Acanthostemma hasseltii is often found in areas with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthostemma hasseltii was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become an invasive species in certain regions. It is commonly found in grasslands and disturbed areas, spreading rapidly due to its ability to produce a large number of seeds. The plant's introduction is believed to have occurred through human activity, such as the transport of contaminated soil or seeds. It poses a threat to native vegetation by outcompeting local plants for resources. Control measures are often necessary to manage its spread and mitigate its ecological impact."
