    "intro": "Apium ammi, commonly known as cow parsley, is a biennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that form umbrella-like clusters. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its seeds, known as psyllium, are used in traditional medicine and as a dietary fiber supplement. Apium ammi is also an important plant for pollinators, providing nectar-rich flowers throughout the summer."
