    "intro": "Afrocarpus falcatus, commonly known as the yellowwood, is a tall evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Podocarpaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark grey bark and lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Afrocarpus falcatus is valued for its durable wood and plays an important role in the ecosystems of its native habitat. It is also considered a keystone species in some forest communities."
