    "intro": "Amelichloa caudata, commonly known as the tufted false brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, silver-green foliage that often forms dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Amelichloa caudata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
