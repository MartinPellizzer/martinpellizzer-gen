    "intro": "Acer acinatum, commonly known as the maple-leaved elm, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that resemble those of maple trees. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by spherical, greenish fruits that turn red as they mature. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it typically grows to a height of 20 to 30 meters. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer acinatum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly the Pyrenees, Apennines, and Alps. It is also found in parts of northern Africa, including the Atlas Mountains. This species thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Its natural range extends into western Asia, including regions of Turkey and the Caucasus. Acer acinatum is commonly associated with rocky and limestone-rich habitats.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer acinatum was mainly introduced to ornamental and horticultural purposes due to its attractive foliage and unique growth habit. It is commonly found in gardens and parks where it is valued for its aesthetic appeal. The plant is often used in landscape design to add visual interest and texture to the environment. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns about its ecological impact in non-native habitats."
