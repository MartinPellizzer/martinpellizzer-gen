    "intro": "Aegiphila roraimensis, commonly known as Roraima's aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to the tepuis of southern Venezuela and northern Brazil. It belongs to the family Lamiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, narrow leaves, and small, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of purple and blue. It thrives in the humid, nutrient-poor soils of the highland regions, often growing in rocky or sandy substrates. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species, making it of interest to botanists and conservationists."
