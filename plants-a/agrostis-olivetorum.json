    "intro": "Agrostis olivetorum, commonly known as the olive grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and gravelly areas. Agrostis olivetorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
