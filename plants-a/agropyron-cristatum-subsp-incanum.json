    "intro": "Agropyron cristatum subsp. incanum, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage crop."
