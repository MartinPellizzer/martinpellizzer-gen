    "intro": "Alyssum montanum subsp. diffusum, commonly known as the spreading alpine alyssum, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid or rocky habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in difficult environments."
