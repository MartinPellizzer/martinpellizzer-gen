    "intro": "Armeria labradorica, commonly known as Labrador's thrift, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant features dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are linear and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. Armeria labradorica thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats."
