    "intro": "Asplenium szechuanense, commonly known as the Sichuan spleenwort, is a fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that often form dense, carpet-like growths. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium szechuanense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
