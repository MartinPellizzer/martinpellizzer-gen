    "intro": "Aristida micrantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf threeawn, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky soils, and disturbed areas. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet cluster, with small, spikelet-like flowers that are wind-pollinated. Aristida micrantha is valued for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a forage plant."
