    "intro": "Arabis cilicica, commonly known as the Cilician rockcress, is a perennial herb native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky and calcareous soils, often in mountainous areas. The plant features basal rosettes of lanceolate, glaucous leaves and produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers. It blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Arabis cilicica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
