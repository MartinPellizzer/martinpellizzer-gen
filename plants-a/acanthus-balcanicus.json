It thrives in rocky and calcareous soils, often found in mountainous regions and along riverbanks. This plant is commonly associated with Mediterranean and continental climates, where it grows in open woodlands and shrublands. It is also present in some areas of Turkey and the former Yugoslavia. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, but it remains most prevalent in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus balcanicus was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. It is commonly found in rocky areas, dry slopes, and along coastal cliffs. This plant has been spread through natural means such as wind and water, as well as human activity. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various environments. Due to its ornamental value, it has also been cultivated in gardens and landscapes in some areas."
