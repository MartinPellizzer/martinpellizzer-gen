    "intro": "Archidendron turgidum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often pinnately arranged and have a leathery texture. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by pods containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its valuable timber, it has been heavily harvested, leading to conservation concerns."
