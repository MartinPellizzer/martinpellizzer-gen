    "intro": "Antirrhinum arenarium, commonly known as the sand snapdragon, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to dry environments. Its foliage is typically narrow and gray-green, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Antirrhinum arenarium is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
