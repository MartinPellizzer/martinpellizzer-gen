It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in a compact head, and it produces achenes as its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.",
