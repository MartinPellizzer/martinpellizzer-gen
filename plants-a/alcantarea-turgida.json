    "intro": "Alcantarea turgida, commonly known as the rock agave, is a striking succulent native to Brazil. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy texture to store water. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with showy, white to yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and ornamental appearance make it a valued addition to both indoor and outdoor landscapes."
