    "intro": "Arthropteris obliterata var. linearis, commonly known as the linear holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern genus characterized by its slender, linear fronds. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and establish new colonies. Its fronds are bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give it a dense, feathery appearance. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
