    "intro": "Androcymbium schlechteri, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers that resemble small bells. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in the humid environment. The flowering period of Androcymbium schlechteri is usually during the warmer months, making it a sought-after ornamental plant for collectors and botanists alike."
