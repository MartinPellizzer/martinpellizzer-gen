    "intro": "Acanthocereus atropurpureus, commonly known as the Purple Night Blooming Cereus, is a flowering cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white, pink, or purple. These flowers emit a strong fragrance to attract pollinators like bats and moths. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthocereus atropurpureus is primarily native to Mexico Southwest. This species is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of this area. It thrives in desert environments with low rainfall and high temperatures. The plant is commonly seen in rocky soils and along limestone formations. Its native range includes parts of northern Mexico, particularly in the states of Chihuahua and Coahuila.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthocereus atropurpureus was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in the southwestern regions such as Texas and California. It was brought for ornamental purposes due to its striking purple flowers and unique appearance. The plant has since become naturalized in some areas, spreading through both seed dispersal and vegetative propagation. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid environments. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities."
