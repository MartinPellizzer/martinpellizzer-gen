    "intro": "Arduina ferox, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a member of the Rutaceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is a small to medium-sized tree characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiny fruits containing seeds. Arduina ferox is known for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living over a century. Due to its hardiness and unique appearance, it is valued for both ornamental and traditional uses."
