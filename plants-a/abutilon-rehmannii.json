    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon rehmannii is primarily native to Botswana, Cape Provinces, Kenya, Namibia, Northern Provinces, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe. This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions across these countries. It thrives in open habitats such as grasslands, savannas, and along riverbanks. The species is well adapted to the dry climate and can tolerate poor soil conditions. Its native range reflects its ecological preference for regions with distinct dry and wet seasons.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon rehmannii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, streambanks, and forest edges. This plant is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can tolerate a range of light conditions. Its spread has raised concerns among land managers and conservationists."
