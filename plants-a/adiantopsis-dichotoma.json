    "intro": "Adiantopsis dichotoma, commonly known as the forked maidenhair fern, is a delicate, epiphytic fern native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its finely divided, bioluminescent fronds that often appear to glow in the dim light of its natural habitat. The plant exhibits a unique dichotomous branching pattern, with each frond splitting into two equal parts, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in high humidity and requires indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in the wild.",
