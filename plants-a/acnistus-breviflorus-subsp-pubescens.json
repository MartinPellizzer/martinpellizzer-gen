It is a shrub characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are typically borne in small, rounded clusters. Its hairy texture, particularly on the stems and leaves, is a distinguishing feature. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions.",
