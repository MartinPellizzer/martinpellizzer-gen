    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon circinatum is primarily native to Mexico and Central America. It is found in regions such as southern Mexico, including the states of Oaxaca, Chiapas, and Veracruz. The plant grows in tropical and subtropical environments, often in dry to semi-arid areas. It is commonly found in open woodlands, shrublands, and along riverbanks. Its native range extends into parts of northern South America, including Colombia and Ecuador.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon circinatum was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates, often as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. It is commonly found in regions such as southern California, Arizona, and parts of Hawaii in the United States. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for both container gardening and landscape planting. Its introduction has led to its establishment in some areas, where it can become invasive if not managed properly. Due to its adaptability, it has been spread through horticultural trade and accidental seed dispersal."
