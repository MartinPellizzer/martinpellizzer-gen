It is characterized by its compound leaves with broad, flat leaflets and produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers in clusters. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has a deep taproot system, which helps it survive in arid conditions. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant is known for its ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
