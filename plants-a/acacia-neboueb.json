    "intro": "Acacia neboueb, commonly known as the African bristled acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often thorned branches and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, oval leaflets. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in cylindrical clusters, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Acacia neboueb is adapted to dry and semi-arid environments, often found in savannas and woodland areas. It plays a role in local ecosystems and has been used traditionally for various purposes, including medicine and crafts.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia neboueb is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is commonly found in savanna and shrubland ecosystems. This species is well adapted to dry conditions and can tolerate high temperatures and low rainfall. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife. Acacia neboueb is also valued for its hard, durable wood and has been used by indigenous communities for various purposes.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia neboueb was mainly introduced to areas with warm, arid climates and well-drained soils, often as part of land reclamation or ornamental planting. It is commonly found in regions of North Africa, the Middle East, and parts of southern Europe. The plant thrives in full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control. However, its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands can lead to ecological concerns in non-native environments. Due to its adaptability, it has been widely adopted in landscaping and restoration projects."
