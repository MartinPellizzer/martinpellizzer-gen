    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelmoschus platydactylus is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including countries such as India, China, and Indonesia. It thrives in warm climates with well-drained soils and is commonly found in open fields and along roadsides. This plant is often associated with humid environments and is adapted to seasonal rainfall patterns. It is also present in parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands. Its native range reflects its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber and seeds.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus platydactylus was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in tropical and subtropical regions. It is commonly found in parts of Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean, where it has been cultivated for its edible fruits and ornamental value. The plant's introduction has been driven by agricultural interests and its adaptability to diverse soil types. However, it has also raised concerns about its potential to become an invasive species in some regions. Its distribution highlights the balance between ecological impact and agricultural benefits."
