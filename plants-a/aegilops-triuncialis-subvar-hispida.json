    "intro": "Aegilops triuncialis subvar. hispida, commonly known as the rough wild rye, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and spikes of small, pale blue to greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is often found in semi-arid environments. It has a fibrous root system and can form dense mats, making it a resilient weed in agricultural settings. The subspecies hispida is distinguished by its more pronounced pubescence compared to other varieties of Aegilops triuncialis."
