It is characterized by its pure white flowers, which contrast sharply with its dark green foliage. Native to South America, this plant thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil. Its flowers are typically tubular with six petals, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its rarity and aesthetic appeal, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens and botanical collections."
