It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Himalayas, particularly in Nepal and Bhutan. The plant is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
