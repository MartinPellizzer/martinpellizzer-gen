It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive blue-green coloration. This species is drought-tolerant and plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
