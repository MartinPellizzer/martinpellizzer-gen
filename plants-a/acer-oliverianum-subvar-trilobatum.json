    "intro": "Acer oliverianum subvar. trilobatum, commonly known as the three-lobed maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its finely toothed, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections for its distinctive foliage and seasonal color changes.",
