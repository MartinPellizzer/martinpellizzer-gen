    "intro": "Acer trifolium, commonly known as the three-leaf maple, is a small deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age. Acer trifolium is often found in moist, shaded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.",
