    "intro": "Aleuritia capitata, commonly known as the snowberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds. Aleuritia capitata typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
