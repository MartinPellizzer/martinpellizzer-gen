    "intro": "Asplenium rhizophorum var. rutaceum, commonly known as the creeping spleenwort, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a dense rosette. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize rocky or soil surfaces. This variety is notable for its adaptability and is often found growing on tree trunks or in rocky crevices."
