It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which resemble those of the common chamomile but are more densely packed. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for garden cultivation. The flowers are often used in herbal teas and have been historically valued for their medicinal properties."
