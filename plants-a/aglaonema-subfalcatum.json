    "intro": "Aglaonema subfalcatum, commonly known as the narrow leaf Chinese evergreen, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves with a striking silver or white midrib. The plant is evergreen, meaning it retains its foliage year-round, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. It thrives in low to moderate light conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value comes from its elegant foliage, which adds a touch of sophistication to any space."
