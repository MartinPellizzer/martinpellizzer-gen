    "intro": "Amphiscopia lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in early to mid-summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Amphiscopia lancifolia plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
