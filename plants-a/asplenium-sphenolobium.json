    "intro": "Asplenium sphenolobium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and capable of producing both roots and new shoots. The spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the undersides of the fronds."
