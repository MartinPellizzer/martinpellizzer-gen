    "intro": "Azalea rigida, commonly known as the stiff azalea, is a species native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in moist, acidic soils along stream banks and in woodlands. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of red, pink, and white during the spring. Its leaves are elliptical and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. Azalea rigida is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
