    "intro": "Aloe carinata var. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth-surfaced aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it store water in arid environments. The leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, and the plant produces small, yellowish flowers on tall, branched stems. It is well adapted to dry climates and requires minimal watering. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and has some traditional medicinal uses."
