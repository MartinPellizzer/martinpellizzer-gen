    "intro": "Amauropelta glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its leathery, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in the soil while absorbing nutrients. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing a dense, green cover throughout the year."
