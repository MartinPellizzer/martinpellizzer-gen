    "intro": "Arrhenatherum album subsp. fernandesii, commonly known as the Portuguese silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and along streambanks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
