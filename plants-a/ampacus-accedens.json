    "intro": "Ampacus accedens, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in a hard, triangular capsule, which splits open when mature. Ampacus accedens is often found in wetlands and along the edges of freshwater bodies, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
