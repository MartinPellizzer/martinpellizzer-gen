    "intro": "Austrostipa, commonly known as the Australian needlegrass, is a genus of grasses native to southern Australia. These plants are typically perennial and form dense tussocks, often found in arid and semi-arid environments. They have narrow, needle-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Austrostipa species are characterized by their slender, often branched inflorescences and small, spikelet-based flowers. They play an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
