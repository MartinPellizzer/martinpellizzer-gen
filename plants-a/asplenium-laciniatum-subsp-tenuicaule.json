    "intro": "Asplenium laciniatum subsp. tenuicaule, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation. The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat."
