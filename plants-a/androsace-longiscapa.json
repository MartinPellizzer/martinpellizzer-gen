    "intro": "Androsace longiscapa, commonly known as the long-stemmed mouse-eared carnation, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features dense clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has succulent, hairy leaves that are often mistaken for moss due to their compact growth habit. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Androsace longiscapa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, decorative ground covers."
