    "intro": "Aurinia, commonly known as the golden groundsel, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its showy yellow flowers and hairy, often glandular leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils and is found in temperate regions of Europe and Asia. Aurinia species are perennial herbs with a rosette of basal leaves and flowering stems that rise from the center. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partially shaded environments."
