    "intro": "Anotites, commonly known as water shield, is a aquatic plant that thrives in shallow, freshwater environments. It has broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically borne on short stalks above the water surface. Its roots are anchored in the mud at the bottom of the water body, helping to stabilize the substrate. Anotites plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
