    "intro": "Arctostaphylos pungens subsp. manzanita, commonly known as manzanita, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers. The plant produces bright red berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Manzanita thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and Mediterranean climates. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective erosion control plant in dry, rocky environments."
