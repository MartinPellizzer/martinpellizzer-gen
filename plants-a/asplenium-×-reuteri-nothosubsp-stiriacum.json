    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 reuteri nothosubsp. stiriacum, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between *Asplenium trichomanes* and *Asplenium ruta-muraria*. It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green, leathery fronds that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its fronds are usually arching and can reach lengths of up to 30 cm, with a distinctive, delicate appearance. Due to its hybrid nature, it is not known to produce viable spores and is primarily propagated through vegetative means."
