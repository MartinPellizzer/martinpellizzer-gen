    "intro": "Actinomeris, commonly known as the genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae, consists of several species that are often found in temperate regions. These plants typically have compound umbels, which are characteristic of the carrot family. The leaves are usually pinnately divided, and the flowers are small and clustered in umbrella-like arrangements. Actinomeris species are often herbaceous and can be annual or perennial. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and some species are used in traditional medicine."
