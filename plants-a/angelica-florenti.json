    "intro": "Angelica florenti, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a biennial or perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems covered in white, hair-like spots and large, umbrella-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, which bloom in summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found near rivers, ditches, and roadsides. Due to its toxic sap, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
