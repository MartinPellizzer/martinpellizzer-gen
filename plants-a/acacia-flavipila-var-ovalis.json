    "intro": "Acacia flavipila var. ovalis, commonly known as the oval-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It features slender, often multi-branched stems and produces small, yellow, globular flowers that appear in late winter to early spring. The leaves are bipinnate, with numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets that give the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide nectar for native pollinators.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia flavipila var. ovalis is primarily native to northern Australia, including parts of Queensland and the Northern Territory. This variant is commonly found in dry tropical and arid regions, often growing in sandy soils. It is typically associated with open woodlands and spinifex grasslands. The plant is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high temperatures and low rainfall. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia flavipila var. ovalis was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or loamy soils and a warm, dry climate. It thrives in regions with low rainfall and full sun exposure. This plant is commonly found in coastal and inland dunes, as well as on rocky slopes. It is often used for erosion control due to its deep root system and drought tolerance. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
