    "intro": "Agrostophyllum pendulatum, commonly known as the hanging grass or pendulous grass, is a flowering plant species native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Restionaceae, which includes many shrubs and grass-like plants adapted to arid environments. The plant is characterized by its drooping, slender inflorescences that give it a distinctive, cascading appearance. Its small, tubular flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits known as caryopses. Agrostophyllum pendulatum is often found in rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
