    "intro": "Antennaria confusa, commonly known as the sticky weed or wooly willow, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense, soft, woolly foliage that is often covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically linear to oblanceolate in shape and are covered in a dense layer of glandular trichomes. Antennaria confusa is adapted to rocky and disturbed soils, often found in alpine and subalpine regions."
