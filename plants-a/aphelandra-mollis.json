It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers with a yellow center, which bloom throughout the year in suitable conditions. Aphelandra mollis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. It is often cultivated as a decorative indoor plant due to its attractive foliage and ornamental flowers."
