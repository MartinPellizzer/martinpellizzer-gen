    "intro": "Alphandia furfuracea, commonly known as the hairy sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy, glandular leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid regions. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its drought tolerance and attractive appearance. Alphandia furfuracea plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
