    "intro": "Astragalus saetiger, commonly known as the bristly milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves with stiff, bristly hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, typical of the Fabaceae family. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. Astragalus saetiger plays a role in stabilizing soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
