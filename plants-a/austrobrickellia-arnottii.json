    "intro": "Austrobrickellia arnottii, commonly known as the coastal brickellia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is a small shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shorelines. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Austrobrickellia arnottii is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds, making it a resilient species in its native environment."
