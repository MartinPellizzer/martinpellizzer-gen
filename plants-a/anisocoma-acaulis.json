    "intro": "Anisocoma acaulis, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with a distinctive rosette of gray-green, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptations to drought and high temperatures make it well-suited for xeriscaping and restoration projects in dry landscapes. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
