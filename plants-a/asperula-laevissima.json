    "intro": "Asperula laevissima, commonly known as the smooth asperula, is a species of evergreen shrub native to western North America. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves that are typically smooth and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Asperula laevissima is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
