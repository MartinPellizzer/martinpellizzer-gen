    "intro": "Allostelites maximum var. serotinum, commonly known as the late-flowering allostelites, is a lesser-known variant within the allostelites genus. It is characterized by its unique floral development, with flowers opening later in the growing season compared to other varieties. The plant typically exhibits a compact growth habit and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Botanically, it is distinguished by its specific morphological traits, including leaf shape and floral structure. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation and biodiversity."
