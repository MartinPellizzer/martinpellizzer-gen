    "intro": "Aspidium aculeatum var. alfaroi, commonly known as the Alfaroi water fern, is a variant of the common water fern, characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds. It is a perennial plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in wetlands and along stream banks. The fronds are pinnately compound, with numerous small, spore-producing sporangia clustered at the tips of the pinnae. This variety is notable for its adaptability to aquatic conditions and its ability to form dense mats on the water's surface. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing aquatic habitats and providing shelter for small aquatic organisms."
