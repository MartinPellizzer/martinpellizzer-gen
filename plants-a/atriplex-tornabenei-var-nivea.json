    "intro": "Atriplex tornabenei var. nivea, commonly known as white saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high salinity. This variety is often used in rehabilitation of degraded lands due to its hardiness and ecological benefits."
