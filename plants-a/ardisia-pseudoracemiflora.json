    "intro": "Ardisia pseudoracemiflora, commonly known as the false racemiflorous ardisia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, including regions such as Thailand and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in the spring. Its fruit is a bright red berry, which is edible but typically consumed by birds rather than humans. Ardisia pseudoracemiflora is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and seasonal flowering."
