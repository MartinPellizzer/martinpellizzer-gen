    "intro": "Allium anzalonei, commonly known as the Anzalone's onion, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It is a bulbous plant with grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring. The plant belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique floral structure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this rare botanical species."
