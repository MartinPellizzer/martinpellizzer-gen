    "intro": "Apium graveolens var. violaceum, commonly known as purple parsley, is a biennial or perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, bluish-green to purple-hued leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its roots are often harvested for culinary or medicinal use, though the leaves are also edible. It thrives in cool climates and is often grown in gardens for both ornamental and practical purposes."
