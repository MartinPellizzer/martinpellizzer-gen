    "intro": "Arenaria congesta var. charlestonensis, commonly known as Charleston sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and maritime habitats. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
