    "intro": "Astragalus nuttallii, commonly known as Nuttall's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish to reddish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and rocky slopes. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Astragalus nuttallii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
