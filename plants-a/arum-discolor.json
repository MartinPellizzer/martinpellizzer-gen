    "intro": "Arum discolor, commonly known as the white arum, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It features a distinctive, umbrella-shaped leaf that can grow up to 2 meters in diameter, with a waxy, pale green surface. The plant produces a spadix surrounded by a showy, white spathe, which resembles a flower but is actually a modified leaf. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The plant is also noted for its ability to tolerate partial shade, making it suitable for a variety of garden settings."
