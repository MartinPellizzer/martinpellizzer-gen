    "intro": "Asplenium germanicum, commonly known as the German spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a creeping rhizome with dense, dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium germanicum is known for its adaptability and can thrive in a variety of soil types, making it a common sight in temperate regions."
