It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils, often found in mountainous regions. It is part of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
