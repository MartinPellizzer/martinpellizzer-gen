This plant is found in the southern and eastern regions of the country, particularly in the states of Oaxaca, Chiapas, and Veracruz. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in humid lowland areas. The species is commonly associated with disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and forest edges. Its natural range is limited to specific ecological zones within this geographic region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon tehuantepecense was mainly introduced to the southern United States, particularly in Texas and Florida, as well as parts of California. It is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and along riverbanks. This species is considered an invasive plant in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It thrives in warm, sunny environments with well-drained soil. Its introduction has raised concerns among land managers due to its potential to alter local ecosystems."
