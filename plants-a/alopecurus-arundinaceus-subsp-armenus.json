    "intro": "Alopecurus arundinaceus subsp. armenus, commonly known as Armenian couchgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and the inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is sometimes cultivated for forage in arid regions."
