    "intro": "Astydamia latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf astydamia, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems that are often hairy and can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a slightly rough texture, and they are arranged alternately along the stem. Astydamia latifolia is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
