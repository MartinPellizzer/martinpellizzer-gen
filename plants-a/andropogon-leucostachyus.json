    "intro": "Andropogon leucostachyus, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and upright growth habit, which makes it visually distinctive. The plant produces panicles of small, white to bluish flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. Silver bluestem is often used in native plant gardens and for erosion control due to its ecological benefits."
