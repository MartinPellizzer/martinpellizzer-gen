    "intro": "Asparagus micranthus, commonly known as the dwarf asparagus or the small-flowered asparagus, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features slender, erect stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, edible berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
