    "intro": "Arenaria serpens var. palustris, commonly known as marsh sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland environments. It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, four-petaled flowers throughout the summer months. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is valued for its ability to stabilize soil in wetland ecosystems and its ornamental appeal in water gardens."
