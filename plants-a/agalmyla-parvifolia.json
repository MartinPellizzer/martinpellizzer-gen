    "intro": "Agalmyla parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved agalmyla, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. Agalmyla parvifolia typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat."
