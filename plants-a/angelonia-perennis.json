    "intro": "Angelonia perennis, commonly known as the summer snapdragon, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and long, spike-like inflorescences that produce clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers. The plant typically blooms from late spring to early autumn, producing vibrant flowers in shades of red, pink, purple, and white. Angelonia perennis thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its foliage is narrow and linear, with a slightly fuzzy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal in gardens."
