    "intro": "Alleizettella, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying solely on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. Alleizettella is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
