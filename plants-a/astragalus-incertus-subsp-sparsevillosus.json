It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It is often found in steppe and desert environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
