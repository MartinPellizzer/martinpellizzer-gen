    "intro": "Apocynum pubescens, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often pubescent. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milky sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals. Apocynum pubescens plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees."
