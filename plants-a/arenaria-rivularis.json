    "intro": "Arenaria rivularis, commonly known as the river sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to moist, sandy or gravelly soils near streams and rivers. It typically features prostrate or ascending stems with small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The flowers are usually white or pink, clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences, and bloom in early summer. It is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, with roots that help stabilize riverbanks. This species is valued for its ability to prevent erosion and its role in wetland ecosystems."
