It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, spikelet-like flowers, typical of many grass species. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in open, sunny areas with well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
