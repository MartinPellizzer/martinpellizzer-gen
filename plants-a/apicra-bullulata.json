    "intro": "Apicra bullulata, commonly known as the velvet leaf orchid, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Apicra bullulata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist conditions."
