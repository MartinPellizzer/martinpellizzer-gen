    "intro": "Acacia ambigua, commonly known as the white wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are grouped in spherical or cylindrical inflorescences. Its foliage is often used in traditional Indigenous practices for its aromatic properties. Acacia ambigua is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia ambigua is primarily native to eastern Australia, including regions such as Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria. It is commonly found in coastal and semi-arid areas, often growing in sandy or clay soils. This species is well adapted to dry and hot climates, making it a characteristic plant of the inland and coastal regions. It is also present in parts of Tasmania and the island of Norfolk. Acacia ambigua is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands, where it plays an important ecological role.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia ambigua was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or gravelly soils, often in semi-arid or arid regions. It thrives in environments with low rainfall and high temperatures. This plant is commonly found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and degraded landscapes. Its introduction has led to its spread across several regions in Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
