    "intro": "Aconitum galeriflorum, commonly known as the showy aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has a tall, upright stem that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, adorned with palmate leaves that have a distinctive, fern-like appearance. Aconitum galeriflorum is characterized by its toxic alkaloids, which make it potentially harmful to both humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade in cooler climates.",
