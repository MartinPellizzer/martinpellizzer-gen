    "intro": "Avena ausserdorferi, commonly known as the Outerdorf oat, is a rare and endangered species native to specific regions of Europe. It is a grass-like plant characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its botanical features make it unique among the Avena genus, with distinct morphological traits that set it apart from other oat species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
