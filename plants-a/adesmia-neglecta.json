    "intro": "Adesmia neglecta, commonly known as the slender milkweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with a deep root system that helps it access water from deeper soil layers. Its milky sap, which is characteristic of the milkweed genus, contains toxic compounds that deter herbivores. Adesmia neglecta plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though it is not as widely cultivated as other milkweed species.",
