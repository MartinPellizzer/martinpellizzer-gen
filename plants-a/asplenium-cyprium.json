    "intro": "Asplenium cyprium, commonly known as the Cyprus spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in moist, shaded environments. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often divided into smaller, finger-like segments. It produces spores in compact, club-like structures called sorangia, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium cyprium is a low-maintenance plant that is often cultivated for its ornamental value in humid, indoor settings."
