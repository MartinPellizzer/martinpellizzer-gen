    "intro": "Aneilema rugosum, commonly known as the rough-leaved aneilema, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Araceae family, which is characterized by its unique inflorescence structure consisting of a spadix and a spathe. The plant features dark green, rough-textured leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. Aneilema rugosum produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow, surrounded by a showy, white spathe. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some African communities."
