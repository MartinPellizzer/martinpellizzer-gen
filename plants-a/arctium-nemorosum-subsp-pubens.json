    "intro": "Arctium nemorosum subsp. pubens, commonly known as the pubescent burdock, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces purple to brown flowers arranged in composite heads, which are surrounded by bracts. Its most distinctive feature is the spiny, burs that form around the seed heads, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. This subspecies is typically found in moist, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows."
