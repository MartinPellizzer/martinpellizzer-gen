    "intro": "Aphelandra grangeri, commonly known as the silver lace plant, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery or white powdery coating. The plant produces small, fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and high humidity to flourish. Aphelandra grangeri is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and air-purifying qualities."
