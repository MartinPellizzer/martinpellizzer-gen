    "intro": "Astragalus bolanderi, commonly known as Bolander's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and slopes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are compound with numerous leaflets. It is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
