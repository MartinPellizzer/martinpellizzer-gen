    "intro": "Anthriscus glacialis, commonly known as the alpine cow parsley, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features slender, hairy stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family (Apiaceae). It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Due to its delicate structure, it is adapted to withstand harsh weather conditions at high altitudes."
