    "intro": "Arenaria procera, commonly known as the tall sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are usually fleshy and succulent, helping it retain moisture in dry conditions. Arenaria procera is often found in tundra and mountainous areas across the northern hemisphere."
