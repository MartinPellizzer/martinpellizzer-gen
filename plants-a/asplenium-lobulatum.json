    "intro": "Asplenium lobulatum, commonly known as the button fern, is a small evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features delicate, leathery, strap-shaped fronds that are typically light green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly and form dense clumps. It thrives in shady, humid environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and shaded garden beds."
