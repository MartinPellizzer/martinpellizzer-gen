    "intro": "Asparagus africanus var. microphyllus, commonly known as the dwarf asparagus, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, narrow leaves that are densely packed along its stems, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by small, red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions."
