    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha peduncularis var. genuina is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is commonly found in lowland areas with rich, well-drained soil. This plant is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats due to its adaptability. It is also present in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. Its native distribution is largely confined to the Indo-Malayan region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha peduncularis var. genuina was mainly introduced to Hawaii. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in disturbed habitats throughout the islands. It is considered a noxious weed in some regions because of its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, prompting efforts to control its spread."
