    "intro": "Astragalus lancearius, commonly known as the lanceleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus lancearius is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
