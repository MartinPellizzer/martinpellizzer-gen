    "intro": "Asplenium acutiusculum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided, and dark green fronds that resemble the shape of a feather. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium acutiusculum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
