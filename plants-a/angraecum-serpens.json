    "intro": "Angraecum serpens, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a climbing epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, spiraling stems and clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a unique spiral growth pattern, which helps it climb and reach light in its native habitat. Its flowers have a specialized structure that attracts specific nocturnal pollinators, such as hawkmoths. Angraecum serpens is also notable for its ability to store water in its pseudobulbs, allowing it to survive in arid conditions."
