    "intro": "Agrostis clavata, commonly known as the clustered bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth on rocky or dry soils, often found in alpine or coastal environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and establish itself in challenging conditions. Agrostis clavata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
