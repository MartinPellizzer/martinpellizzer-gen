It thrives in humid, shaded environments within the Amazon Basin. The species is commonly associated with secondary growth areas and forest edges. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these geographic areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abuta panurensis was mainly introduced to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. It is commonly found in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool and temperate climates. This plant is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used by local communities for centuries. Its introduction to these areas is largely due to traditional knowledge and ecological adaptation. However, its distribution remains limited to specific altitudinal zones due to environmental constraints."
