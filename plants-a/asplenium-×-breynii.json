    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 breynii, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Asplenium \u00d7 breynii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
