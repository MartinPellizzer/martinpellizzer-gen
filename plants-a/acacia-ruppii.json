    "intro": "Acacia ruppii, commonly known as the white wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in winter. The plant produces small, flat, green pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Acacia ruppii is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates. It is also valued for its role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia ruppii is primarily native to New South Wales and Queensland. It is commonly found in the subtropical and tropical regions of these states. This plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in coastal or inland areas. It is well adapted to the climate and environmental conditions of these regions. Acacia ruppii plays an important role in local ecosystems and is often used in landscaping due to its hardy nature.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia ruppii was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions where it can thrive in well-drained soils. It has been introduced to parts of Southeast Asia, including countries like Indonesia and the Philippines, where it is used for ornamental purposes and soil stabilization. The plant is also found in parts of Australia and has been introduced to some Pacific Island nations. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it has sometimes become invasive in local ecosystems. Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native flora and biodiversity in these regions."
