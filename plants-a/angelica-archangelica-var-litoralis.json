    "intro": "Angelica archangelica var. litoralis, commonly known as sea angelica, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe and northern Africa. It thrives in moist, sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, often in areas exposed to sea spray. The plant features large, deeply lobed leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, and it produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer. Sea angelica is valued for its aromatic, slightly sweet scent and has been used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. Its adaptability to coastal environments makes it an important component of maritime ecosystems."
