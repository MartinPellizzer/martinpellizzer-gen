    "intro": "Asarca glandulifera var. illapeliana, commonly known as the Illapel glandular asarum, is a perennial herb native to southern Chile. It features dark green, heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins and is characterized by its clusters of small, reddish-brown flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest understories. Its medicinal properties have been studied for their potential anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. The varietal distinction is based on subtle differences in leaf morphology and habitat preference compared to the typical form."
