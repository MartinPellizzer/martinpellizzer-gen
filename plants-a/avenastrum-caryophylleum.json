    "intro": "Avenastrum caryophylleum, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact, low-growing habit with hairy, gray-green foliage adapted to withstand drought conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats. Avenastrum caryophylleum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native environment."
