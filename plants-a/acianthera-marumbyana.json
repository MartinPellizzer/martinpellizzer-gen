    "intro": "Acianthera marumbyana, commonly known as the Marumbyana orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its humid, shaded habitat. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss. Acianthera marumbyana is often found growing on tree trunks or in rocky crevices, demonstrating its adaptability to challenging environments.",
