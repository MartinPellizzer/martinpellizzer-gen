    "intro": "Allium chionanthum, commonly known as the snowball garlic, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of white or pale pink flowers that resemble snowballs. The plant produces small, bulbous structures that serve as its reproductive organs, typical of the Allium genus. Its leaves are grass-like and form a rosette near the base, while the stems are short and often obscured by the flower clusters. Allium chionanthum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
