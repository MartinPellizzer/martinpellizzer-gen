    "intro": "Austroblechnum lanceolatum, commonly known as the lanceolate holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to southern South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped, leathery fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in groups. Austroblechnum lanceolatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage."
