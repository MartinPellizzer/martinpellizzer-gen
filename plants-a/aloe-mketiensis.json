    "intro": "Aloe mketiensis, commonly known as the Mketi aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick and fleshy, adapted for storing water in arid environments. The leaves are typically gray-green in color with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It produces yellow flowers in spring, which are borne on tall, branched stems. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has some traditional medicinal uses."
