    "intro": "Acacia repanda, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces yellow globular flowers that bloom in spring, attracting a variety of pollinators. Its seed pods are long and cylindrical, containing hard, woody seeds. Acacia repanda is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia repanda is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the southern and western regions of the state, particularly in areas with sandy soils. This species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in shrublands and open woodlands. It is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the region. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia repanda was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in areas with degraded land. It is commonly used in reforestation projects due to its rapid growth and hardiness. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it suitable for regions with high temperatures and low rainfall. Its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil also enhances soil fertility for other plant species. However, it can become invasive in some ecosystems if not managed properly."
