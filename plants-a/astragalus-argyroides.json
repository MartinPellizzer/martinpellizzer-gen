    "intro": "Astragalus argyroides, commonly known as silverleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in the summer months. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers. Astragalus argyroides is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and limited water availability."
