    "intro": "Allagoptera brevicalyx, commonly known as the small-leaved allagoptera, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Asia, particularly India and Sri Lanka, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, ovate leaves with a smooth surface and clusters of pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
