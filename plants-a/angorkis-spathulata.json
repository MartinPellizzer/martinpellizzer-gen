    "intro": "Angorkis spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leafed angorkis, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural arid habitat. Angorkis spathulata is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
