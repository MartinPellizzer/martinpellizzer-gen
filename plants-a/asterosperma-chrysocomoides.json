It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has palmate leaves with a hairy texture, and its stems are often covered in fine, white pubescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing along the bases of trees or in dense undergrowth. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
