    "intro": "Aspidium intermedium var. rhodolepis, commonly known as the red-veined brake, is a fern species native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds with distinctive red veins, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium intermedium var. rhodolepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
