    "intro": "Alyssum emarginatum, commonly known as seaside alyssum, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a low-growing annual or biennial species with dense clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has silver-gray foliage covered in fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dunes and rocky coastal habitats. Alyssum emarginatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize coastal soils."
