    "intro": "Aconitum \u00d7 stoerkianum var. tricolor, commonly known as the tricolor monkshood, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue-purple flowers with a yellow and white pattern on the upper lip. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in temperate climates. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens.",
