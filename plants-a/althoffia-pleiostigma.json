    "intro": "Althoffia pleiostigma, commonly known as the tropical water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that provide shade over the water's surface. The plant produces white, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are submerged, anchoring the plant in shallow waters and absorbing nutrients from the sediment. Althoffia pleiostigma plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering pollutants and providing habitat for aquatic life."
