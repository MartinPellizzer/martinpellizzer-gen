    "intro": "Austrostipa centralis, commonly known as the Central Plains grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Austrostipa centralis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and resilience to poor soil conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitat."
