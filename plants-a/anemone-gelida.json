    "intro": "Anemone gelida, commonly known as the frozen anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It features a rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves that help it retain heat and moisture in cold climates. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is adapted to withstand harsh winter conditions. Anemone gelida is often found in tundra and alpine environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
