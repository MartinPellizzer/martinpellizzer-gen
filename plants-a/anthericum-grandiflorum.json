    "intro": "Anthericum grandiflorum, commonly known as the large-flowered nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features tall, erect stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with heart-shaped, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the Araliaceae family. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. The plant contains irritant chemicals in its sap, similar to other members of the nettle family."
