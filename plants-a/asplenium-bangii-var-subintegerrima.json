    "intro": "Asplenium bangii var. subintegerrima, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant has a compact growth habit and produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments such as botanical gardens."
