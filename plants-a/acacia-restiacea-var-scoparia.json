    "intro": "Acacia restiacea var. scoparia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, feathery foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has phyllodes rather than true leaves, which are narrow and strap-like, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia restiacea var. scoparia is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and parts of South Africa. This variant is commonly found in sandy soils and rocky outcrops, often in shrubland and savanna ecosystems. It is well adapted to dry climates and can tolerate high temperatures and low rainfall. The plant plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for local wildlife. Its distribution is largely restricted to the southern African continent where it thrives in its native environment.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia restiacea var. scoparia was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and provide forage for livestock in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly found in degraded lands and along roadsides where it establishes quickly. The plant is valued for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. However, it can become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has had mixed ecological impacts, depending on the local environment and management practices."
