    "intro": "Andrachne elliptica, commonly known as the elliptic sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are elliptical in shape, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. Andrachne elliptica is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
