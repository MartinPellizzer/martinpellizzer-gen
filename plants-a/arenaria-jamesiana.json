    "intro": "Arenaria jamesiana, commonly known as the James's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Arenaria jamesiana is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, sunny environments."
