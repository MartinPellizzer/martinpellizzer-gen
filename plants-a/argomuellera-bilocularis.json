    "intro": "Argomuellera bilocularis, commonly known as the two-celled argomuellera, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are opposite and often have a glossy surface, while its flowers are usually pale green or white. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
