    "intro": "Ascyrum involutum, commonly known as the spiral fern, is a small, delicate fern native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tightly coiled, spiral-shaped fronds that unfurl as they grow. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology makes it a distinctive and interesting species within the fern family."
