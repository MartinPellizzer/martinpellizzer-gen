    "intro": "Alloplectus strigillosus, commonly known as the hairy false nettle, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, hairy textures, giving it its common name. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits known as utricles. Alloplectus strigillosus is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
