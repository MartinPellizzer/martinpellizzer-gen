    "intro": "Alyssum edentulum var. sphaerocarpum, commonly known as the globe alyssum, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces spherical, seed-like structures called sphaerocarps, which are distinctive and contribute to its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. The foliage is typically gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions."
