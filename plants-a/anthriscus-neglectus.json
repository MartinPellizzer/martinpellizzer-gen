    "intro": "Anthriscus neglectus, commonly known as hedge garlic, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers that appear in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Anthriscus neglectus is also known for its mild garlic-like scent, which becomes more pronounced when the leaves are crushed."
