    "intro": "Anoma moringa, commonly known as the drumstick tree or moringa, is a fast-growing, drought-resistant plant native to the Indian subcontinent. It features a slender, branched stem with large, feathery leaves that are rich in vitamins and minerals. The plant produces small, green, pod-like fruits that turn yellow when mature, containing nutrient-dense seeds. Its leaves, flowers, and seeds are all edible and widely used in traditional medicine and cooking. Anoma moringa is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its potential for sustainable agriculture."
