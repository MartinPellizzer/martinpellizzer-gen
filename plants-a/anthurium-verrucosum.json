    "intro": "Anthurium verrucosum, commonly known as the velvet anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces bright red spadices, which are the spiky, club-shaped inflorescences typical of the Araceae family. Its foliage is often a deep green with a waxy surface, and it thrives in humid, shady environments. Anthurium verrucosum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
