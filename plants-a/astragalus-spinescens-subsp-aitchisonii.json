The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets and produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain lens-shaped seeds. It is adapted to dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. This subspecies is of interest in ecological and botanical studies due to its resilience and potential medicinal properties."
