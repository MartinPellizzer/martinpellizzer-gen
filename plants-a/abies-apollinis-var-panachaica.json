    "intro": "Abies apollinis var. panachaica, commonly known as the Panachaea fir, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Carpathians in Romania. It is characterized by its tall, slender form and distinctive, elongated cones that hang downward. The foliage consists of dark green, needle-like leaves that are closely packed and provide dense coverage. This variety is adapted to cold, moist environments and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat loss.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies apollinis var. panachaica is primarily native to the eastern and central regions of the Russian Far East, including the Primorsky Krai and adjacent areas. This variant of the silver fir is found in mountainous terrain, particularly in the Sikhote-Alin mountain range. It thrives in cool, humid climates with well-drained soils, often growing at elevations between 800 and 2,000 meters. The plant is endemic to this specific region and is not found naturally elsewhere. Its limited distribution makes it a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies apollinis var. panachaica was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its unique appearance and hardiness. It is valued for its conical shape, dark green foliage, and striking red bark, making it a popular choice for landscaped gardens and parks. This variety is particularly favored in regions with cold climates because of its ability to thrive in harsh winter conditions. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in non-native environments. Proper management is recommended to prevent unintended ecological impacts."
