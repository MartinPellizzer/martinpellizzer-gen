    "intro": "Aloe asperiuscula, commonly known as the rough aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow-orange flowers, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their soothing properties. Aloe asperiuscula is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and requires minimal water to thrive."
