    "intro": "Aspilia kitsonii, commonly known as the Kitson's flame flower, is a striking flowering plant native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy yellow-orange inflorescences that resemble flames. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Aspilia kitsonii thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often growing in open grasslands or along forest edges. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its dramatic floral display."
