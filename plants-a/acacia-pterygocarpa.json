    "intro": "Acacia pterygocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, feathery foliage and produces yellow flowers in clusters during the spring. The plant has phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that function as leaves, and it is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Acacia pterygocarpa is often found in sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh conditions. It also plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various wildlife species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia pterygocarpa is primarily native to northern Australia, including parts of Queensland, the Northern Territory, and Western Australia. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in sandy soils. This species is well adapted to dry climates and can thrive in areas with low rainfall. It is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands, forming dense thickets. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia pterygocarpa was mainly introduced to areas with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in coastal regions and inland valleys. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its deep root system and ability to tolerate drought. It has been introduced to several countries in southern Europe, parts of the United States, and Australia. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
