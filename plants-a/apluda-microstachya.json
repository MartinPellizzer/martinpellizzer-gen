    "intro": "Apluda microstachya, commonly known as the small-stalked apluda, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It typically grows in wetland and marshy environments, preferring moist, acidic soils. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in suitable habitats. Apluda microstachya is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wetland organisms."
