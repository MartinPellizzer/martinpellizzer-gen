    "intro": "Astragalus bibullatus, commonly known as the horned milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, and its leaves are typically compound with small, oval leaflets. Astragalus bibullatus is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It is a member of the legume family and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria."
