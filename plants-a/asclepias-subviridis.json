    "intro": "Asclepias subviridis, commonly known as the green milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers with distinctive hooded structures, which are attractive to pollinators like butterflies. Its milky sap, characteristic of the milkweed genus, contains latex compounds that can be toxic to some animals. Asclepias subviridis plays an important ecological role by supporting monarch butterfly populations during their life cycle."
