    "intro": "Ambraria microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaf ambraria, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its flowers bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, Ambraria microphylla is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
