    "intro": "Atriplex barclayana subsp. typica, commonly known as the saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it an important component of desert ecosystems. The subspecies typica is distinguished by its more compact growth form compared to other subspecies of Atriplex barclayana."
