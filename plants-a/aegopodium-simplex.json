    "intro": "Aegopodium simplex, commonly known as bishop's weed, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its roots and leaves contain compounds such as apiol and limonene, which have been used in traditional medicine. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils and can sometimes be considered a weed in agricultural settings."
