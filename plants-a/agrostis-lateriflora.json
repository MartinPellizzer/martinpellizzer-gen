    "intro": "Agrostis lateriflora, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a common component of grassland ecosystems. Agrostis lateriflora is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
