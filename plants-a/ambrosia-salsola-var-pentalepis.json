    "intro": "Ambrosia salsola var. pentalepis, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and succulent leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in desert and coastal environments. Due to its drought tolerance and rapid growth, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in harsh climates."
