    "intro": "Andropogon amplectens var. catangensis, commonly known as catangensis bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often hairy along the edges. This grass thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and swamps, and is adapted to saturated soil conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle with spikelets that are loosely arranged, typical of the grass family Poaceae. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
