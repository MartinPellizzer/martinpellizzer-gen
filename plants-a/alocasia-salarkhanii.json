    "intro": "Alocasia salarkhanii, commonly known as the Salarkhanii Elephant Ear, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 feet in length, often with a deep green color and prominent veins. The plant thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is highly ornamental, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes. Alocasia salarkhanii is relatively low maintenance but benefits from regular watering and bright, indirect light."
