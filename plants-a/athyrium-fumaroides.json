    "intro": "Athyrium fumaroides, commonly known as the flame fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, bright red to orange fronds that resemble flames, making it a striking ornamental plant. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clumps over time. The fronds are biennial, with new growth emerging from the base each year."
