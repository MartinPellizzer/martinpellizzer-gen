    "intro": "Aesculus levigata, commonly known as the horse chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and showy, white or pinkish flowers that appear in spring. The tree produces spiny, capsule-like fruits containing glossy, chestnut-like seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Aesculus levigata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also known for its historical use in traditional medicine."
