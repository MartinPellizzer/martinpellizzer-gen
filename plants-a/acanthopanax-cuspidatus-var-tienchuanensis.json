It thrives in temperate to subtropical climates at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. This variant is commonly found in forests with well-drained soils and moderate humidity. It is often associated with secondary growth areas and is sometimes cultivated for its medicinal properties. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopanax cuspidatus var. tienchuanensis was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils, particularly in mountainous areas of China. It thrives in humid environments with partial shade and is often found in forested regions. This variant is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional Chinese medicine. It has also been cultivated in botanical gardens and research institutions for its ecological and pharmaceutical significance. Its introduction has contributed to the biodiversity of plant species in both native and non-native habitats."
