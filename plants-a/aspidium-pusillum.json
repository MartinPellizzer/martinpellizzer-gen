    "intro": "Aspidium pusillum, commonly known as the small shield fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are usually pinnately divided and covered in a dense layer of fine, scale-like structures. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Aspidium pusillum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and light conditions."
