It is found in the southern and western regions of the state, particularly in areas with sandy or gravelly soils. This variety is commonly associated with coastal and inland areas, often growing in open woodlands or heathlands. It thrives in dry, sunny conditions and is adapted to the arid climate of the region. The plant is known for its distinctive yellow flowers and is an important component of the local flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia pulchella var. goadbyi was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and along roadsides, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber and fuelwood. However, it can also pose a threat to native vegetation by competing for resources. Its introduction has led to discussions about its ecological impact and management in local ecosystems."
