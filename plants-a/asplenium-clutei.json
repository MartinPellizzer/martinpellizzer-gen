    "intro": "Asplenium clutei, commonly known as the Clute's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate, while its spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of its leaves. Asplenium clutei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
