It is native to arid regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and Angola. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped clusters of stems that resemble a flower. It has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight."
