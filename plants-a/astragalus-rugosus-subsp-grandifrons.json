    "intro": "Astragalus rugosus subsp. grandifrons, commonly known as the large-fruited milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in desert or sagebrush habitats. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep taproot system adapted to survive in dry conditions. The subspecies is characterized by its larger, more robust flowers compared to other members of the Astragalus species."
