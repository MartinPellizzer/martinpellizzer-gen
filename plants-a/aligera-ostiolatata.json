    "intro": "Aligera ostiolatata, commonly known as the narrow-mouthed alisma, is a species of aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often submerged, with small, white flowers that bloom in the summer. Its reproductive structures are adapted for water dispersal, aiding in its spread. Aligera ostiolatata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
