    "intro": "Allosorus imbricatus, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the eastern United States. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rock faces or in rocky crevices. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth habit with fronds that are typically dark green and slightly curled. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Allosorus imbricatus is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a decorative plant."
