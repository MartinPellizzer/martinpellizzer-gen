    "intro": "Acalypha subterranea, commonly known as the underground euphorbia, is a unique plant species native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant's name reflects its unusual growth habit, as some species exhibit subterranean or partially buried stems. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a garden plant, though it can be invasive in certain areas.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha subterranea is primarily native to Mexico Central and Mexico Southwest. This species is found in the central and southern regions of Mexico, including states such as Guanajuato, Hidalgo, and Oaxaca. It typically grows in dry to semi-arid environments, often in rocky or sandy soils. The plant is adapted to the warm, temperate climate of these regions. It is commonly found in open woodlands and scrublands.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha subterranea was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habits. It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since spread through both natural and human-assisted means. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in forested areas and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats have led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems. Despite its ornamental value, management efforts are ongoing to control its spread in native habitats."
