    "intro": "Angraecum doratophyllum, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It features long, slender, and often pendulous inflorescences with showy, white or pale pink flowers that have a distinct, intricate pattern. The plant has a thick, fleshy rhizome and produces a single, large, fleshy pseudobulb that stores water, allowing it to survive in its arid native environment. It thrives in high-altitude, shaded forest habitats and requires specific conditions to bloom. Due to its rarity and unique beauty, it is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts and conservationists alike."
