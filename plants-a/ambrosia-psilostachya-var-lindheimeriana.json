    "intro": "Ambrosia psilostachya var. lindheimeriana, commonly known as Lindheimer's ragweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodlands, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
