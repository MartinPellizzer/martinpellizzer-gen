It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Agropyron embergeri is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals."
