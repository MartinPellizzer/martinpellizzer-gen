    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha estrellana is primarily native to the island of Estrella in the Philippines. It is found in the mountainous regions of this island, specifically in the province of Zamboanga del Sur. The plant grows in humid, tropical environments, often in secondary forests or along stream banks. It is known for its distinctive red bracts that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha estrellana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It has since become naturalized in several areas, often found growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant spreads primarily through seeds dispersed by wind, water, and human activity. Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to concerns about its potential to outcompete native vegetation. Despite its ornamental value, management efforts are ongoing to control its spread in sensitive ecosystems."
