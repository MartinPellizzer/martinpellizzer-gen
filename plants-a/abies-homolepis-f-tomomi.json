    "intro": "Abies homolepis f. tomomi, commonly known as the Tomomi fir, is a rare and distinctive subspecies of the fir tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are slightly curved. The cones are typically small and reddish-brown when mature, and they release seeds that are dispersed by wind. This subspecies thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",

It thrives in cool, humid climates at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. The plant is commonly found in mixed forests alongside other coniferous and broadleaf species. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies homolepis f. tomomi was mainly introduced to specific regions in Japan, where it has been cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique foliage and adaptability. This distribution is primarily confined to areas with mild climates and well-drained soils, which support its growth. The introduction of this form has been limited to botanical gardens and private collections rather than natural habitats. It is often appreciated for its compact size and aesthetic appeal in landscape design. However, its naturalization outside of these controlled environments remains rare."
