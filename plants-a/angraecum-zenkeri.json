    "intro": "Angraecum zenkeri, commonly known as the Zenker's orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences that bear numerous fragrant, white to pale blue flowers. The plant has a unique growth habit, with thick, fleshy pseudobulbs that store water, allowing it to survive in its arid, high-altitude habitat. Its flowers are pollinated by the giant hawkmoth, a specialized relationship that highlights its ecological significance. Angraecum zenkeri is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts due to its beauty and rarity."
