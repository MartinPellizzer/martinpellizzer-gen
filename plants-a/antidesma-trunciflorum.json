    "intro": "Antidesma trunciflorum, commonly known as the African starfruit or wild starfruit, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange to red berries that are edible. Its fruits are often used in local cuisines and have a tart, acidic flavor similar to that of the common starfruit. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage and fruit."
