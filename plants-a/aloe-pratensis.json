    "intro": "Aloe pratensis, commonly known as the marsh aloe, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The leaves are usually bluish-green in color and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. This plant is adapted to wet, marshy environments and is often found in swampy areas."
