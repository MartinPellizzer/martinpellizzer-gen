    "intro": "Avena hostii, commonly known as the velvet grass or Spanish needle, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, fluffy seed heads that resemble dandelion seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. Avena hostii typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and unique seed structures."
