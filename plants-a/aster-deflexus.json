    "intro": "Aster deflexus, commonly known as the bentleaf aster, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often curled or folded at the edges. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white to pale purple, typically blooming in late summer to early fall. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. Aster deflexus is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
