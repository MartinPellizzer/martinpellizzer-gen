    "intro": "Asplenium bulbiferum var. normale, commonly known as the common shield fern, is a species native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. It produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are released during the spring and summer months. This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
