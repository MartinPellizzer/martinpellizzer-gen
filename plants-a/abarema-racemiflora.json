    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abarema racemiflora is primarily native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which spans several states in eastern Brazil. This plant thrives in humid tropical environments with well-drained soils. It is commonly found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Its distribution is limited to specific regions within the Brazilian rainforest due to its particular ecological requirements.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema racemiflora was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in Brazil, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive pink flowers. It is commonly found in regions with warm, humid climates and well-drained soil. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes. Its introduction has led to its naturalization in some areas, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. Despite its beauty, it requires careful management to prevent it from spreading beyond controlled environments."
