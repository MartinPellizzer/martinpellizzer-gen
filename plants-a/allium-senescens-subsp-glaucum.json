    "intro": "Allium senescens subsp. glaucum, commonly known as the blue onion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It features basal rosettes of glaucous, strap-shaped leaves that are often tinged with blue or purple hues. The plant produces upright flowering stems that bear small, spherical, blue to purple flowers in late summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits. The subspecies is closely related to other allium species, including garlic and leeks, but is distinguished by its unique coloration and growth habit."
