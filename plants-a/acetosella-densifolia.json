    "intro": "Acetosella densifolia, commonly known as the dense-leaved sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a tangy, sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. Acetosella densifolia is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in partial shade.",
