    "intro": "Anagallis linifolia var. maritima, commonly known as the sea thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It features slender, wiry stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to withstand salt spray and sandy soils. It is often found in dunes, cliffs, and other coastal habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing sand and preventing erosion."
