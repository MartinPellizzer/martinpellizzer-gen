    "intro": "Alopecurus geniculatus var. aquaticus, commonly known as water bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, exhibiting a distinctive growth habit with a basal rosette of leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration, and it often forms dense mats in aquatic environments. This variety is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
