    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha reticulata f. meeusei is primarily native to the Philippines. It is found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in the islands of Luzon, Mindanao, and Palawan. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. It is commonly associated with lowland and montane forests. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha reticulata f. meeusei was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It is commonly found in gardens and along coastal areas where it thrives in sunny, well-drained conditions. The plant is considered invasive in some regions because of its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal. It has been reported in several parts of the country, particularly in the North Island. Despite its ornamental value, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems."
