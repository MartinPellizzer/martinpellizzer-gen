It is a natural hybrid between Aesculus glabra and Aesculus hippocastanum, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The tree produces large, showy white or pink flowers in panicles during early spring, followed by spiny, spherical fruits containing shiny, chestnut-like seeds. Its leaves are palmately compound, with five to seven leaflets, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
