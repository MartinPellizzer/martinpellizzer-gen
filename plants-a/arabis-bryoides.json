    "intro": "Arabis bryoides, commonly known as the mossy rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a dense mat that helps it survive in harsh environments. Arabis bryoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
