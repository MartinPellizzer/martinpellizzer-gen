    "intro": "Aeluropus littoralis var. sinkiangensis, commonly known as the Xinjiang saltgrass, is a halophytic grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, often found in coastal and inland salt marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
