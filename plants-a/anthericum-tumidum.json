    "intro": "Anthericum tumidum, commonly known as the broad-leaf lily of the valley, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It features lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Anthericum tumidum is often found in moist, shaded woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
