    "intro": "Arrabidaea rhodantha var. elliptica, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a species native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its leaves are alternate and pinnate, with elliptical leaflets that contribute to its distinctive appearance. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
