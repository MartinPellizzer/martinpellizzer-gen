    "intro": "Anthocercis viscosa subsp. viscosa, commonly known as the sticky anthocercis, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that give the plant a sticky texture, which is a key botanical feature. The leaves are typically opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces small, clustered flowers with white to pale yellow petals, often accompanied by yellow stamens. This subspecies is native to parts of Africa and is adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments."
