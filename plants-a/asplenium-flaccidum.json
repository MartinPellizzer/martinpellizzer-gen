    "intro": "Asplenium flaccidum, commonly known as the limp shield fern, is a small evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has slender, dark green fronds that are often drooping, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium flaccidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens or as a houseplant."
