    "intro": "Allium tschulaktavicum, commonly known as the Tschulaktav mountain garlic, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its bulbous stem and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat."
