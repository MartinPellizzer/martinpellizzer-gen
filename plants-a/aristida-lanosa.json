    "intro": "Aristida lanosa, commonly known as silky grass or woolly wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its finely hairy leaves that give it a soft, silky appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, woodlands, and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet cluster with slender, bract-like structures. Aristida lanosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and animals."
