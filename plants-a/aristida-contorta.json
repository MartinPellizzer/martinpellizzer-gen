    "intro": "Aristida contorta, commonly known as curled hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, meadows, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often curled or twisted. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture. Aristida contorta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
