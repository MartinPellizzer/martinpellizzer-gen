It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. The plant features lanceolate to arrow-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a distinct basal rosette. Its flowers are showy, with blue to purple petals arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower, more pointed leaves compared to the typical form of Aster cordifolius."
