    "intro": "Aconitum lasianthum, commonly known as the blue aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a fine, silky hair. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets.",
