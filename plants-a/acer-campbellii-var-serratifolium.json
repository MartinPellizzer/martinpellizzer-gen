    "intro": "Acer campbellii var. serratifolium, commonly known as the Campbell's maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China. It is characterized by its finely serrated, ovate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters and thrives in well-drained soil with partial to full sun. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its striking foliage and adaptability to various climates.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer campbellii var. serratifolium is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China, specifically in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou. This variety of maple is commonly found in temperate forests at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level. It thrives in areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, often growing in mixed hardwood forests. The plant is known for its distinctive serrated leaves and is a valued ornamental species in horticulture. Its native range is characterized by high biodiversity and unique ecological conditions that support its growth.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer campbellii var. serratifolium was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the United States and Canada, as an ornamental plant due to its unique leaf shape and aesthetic appeal. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and parks for its vibrant autumn foliage and ornamental value. Despite its beauty, it has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain regions. The plant's introduction has led to discussions about its ecological impact and management. Its distribution is primarily limited to cultivated areas, though it has occasionally escaped into the wild."
