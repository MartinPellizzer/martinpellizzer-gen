    "intro": "Acacia uniglandulosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, glandular-stemmed structure and bipinnate leaves that are narrow and often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces yellow floral spikes that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Acacia uniglandulosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia uniglandulosa is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe. It is commonly found in savanna and grassland ecosystems, often growing in well-drained soils. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a characteristic plant of the region's dry environments. It is often seen along roadsides, in open woodlands, and on rocky outcrops. The plant plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia uniglandulosa was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often seen in coastal and inland areas. Its introduction has led to some ecological concerns due to its potential invasiveness. It is valued for its hardy nature and ability to withstand drought conditions."
