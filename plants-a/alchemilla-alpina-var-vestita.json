It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, silver-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense, umbrella-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its hirsute (hairy) leaves and frost-resistant nature make it a hardy and ornamental plant in gardens."
