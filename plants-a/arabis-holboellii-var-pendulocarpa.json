    "intro": "Arabis holboellii var. pendulocarpa, commonly known as the weeping rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, cruciform flowers. The plant is characterized by its pendulous, drooping inflorescences that give it a distinctive, weeping appearance. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces small white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
