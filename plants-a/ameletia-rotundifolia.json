    "intro": "Ameletia rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leafed ameletia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. The plant features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers. Its reproductive system relies on wind pollination, and it is adapted to thrive in humid, temperate climates. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
