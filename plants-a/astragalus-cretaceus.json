    "intro": "Astragalus cretaceus, commonly known as the Cretaceous milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus cretaceus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing food for various pollinators."
