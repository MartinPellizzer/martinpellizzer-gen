    "intro": "Amyema irrubescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is characterized by its vibrant red to orange thallus, which becomes more pronounced with age. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and cyanobacteria, which provide essential nutrients through photosynthesis. It is often found on bark, stones, and soil in temperate regions. Its unique coloration and ecological role make it an important indicator species for forest health."
