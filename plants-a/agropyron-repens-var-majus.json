    "intro": "Agropyron repens var. majus, commonly known as the tall brome grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and meadows. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is valued for its ecological role in preventing erosion and providing habitat for small animals and insects."
