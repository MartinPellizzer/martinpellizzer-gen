    "intro": "Arbulocarpus, commonly known as the false arum, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It is characterized by its striking, often colorful inflorescences that consist of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plants typically have a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing them to spread vegetatively. Arbulocarpus species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and the Americas. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their unique and exotic appearance."
