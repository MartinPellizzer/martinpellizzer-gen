    "intro": "Artemisia lagopus subsp. jarovoi, commonly known as the alpine tamarisk, is a perennial shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine tundra and mountainous areas. This subspecies is adapted to harsh climatic conditions and plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for arctic wildlife."
