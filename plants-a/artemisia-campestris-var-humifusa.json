    "intro": "Artemisia campestris var. humifusa, commonly known as white wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features silver-gray foliage with finely divided, aromatic leaves that emit a strong, camphor-like scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats like roadsides and fields. Due to its medicinal properties and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
