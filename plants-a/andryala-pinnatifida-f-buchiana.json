It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately divided into multiple leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its native habitat, with features that support its growth in humid, temperate climates."
