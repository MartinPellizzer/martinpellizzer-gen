It is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals and a unique floral structure that distinguishes it from other orchid species. Native to specific regions in South America, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers emit a subtle fragrance, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its limited habitat and susceptibility to environmental changes, Aglossorrhyncha aurea is considered a vulnerable species."
