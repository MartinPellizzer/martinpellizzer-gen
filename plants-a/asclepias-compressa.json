    "intro": "Asclepias compressa, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Asclepias compressa is a host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing essential nourishment for monarch caterpillars. Its latex sap contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to most herbivores."
