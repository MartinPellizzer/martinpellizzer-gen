    "intro": "Acronema rivale, commonly known as the water clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic plants such as carrots and parsley. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often submerged or floating on water surfaces. Acronema rivale produces small, greenish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It is often found in wet meadows, ponds, and along the edges of streams, where it thrives in shallow, nutrient-rich waters.",
