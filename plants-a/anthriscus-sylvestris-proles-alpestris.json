    "intro": "Anthriscus sylvestris proles alpestris, commonly known as the Alpine cow parsley, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine soils and thrives in cooler, moist environments. It is often found in meadows, forest edges, and along stream banks at higher elevations. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of alpine ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
