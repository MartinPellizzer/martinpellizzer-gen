    "intro": "Acer heldreichii subsp. heldreichii, commonly known as the Carpathian maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Carpathian Mountains in Europe. It is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The tree produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems.",
