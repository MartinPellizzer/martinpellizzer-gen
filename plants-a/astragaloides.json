    "intro": "Astragaloides, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, where they thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Astragaloides species are characterized by their slender, often hairy stems and small, compound leaves. The flowers are usually pink or purple, arranged in racemes, and are accompanied by small, pod-like fruits. These plants play an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in their native habitats."
