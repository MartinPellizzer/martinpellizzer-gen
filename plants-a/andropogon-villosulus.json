    "intro": "Andropogon villosulus, commonly known as hairy bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, hairy leaves, and small, blue-green flowers that appear in summer. The plant typically grows in full sun and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common sight in prairie and open woodland habitats. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization. Hairy bluestem is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability."
