    "intro": "Artabotrys crassipetalus, commonly known as the broad-petaled starfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant, white flowers that resemble stars, which bloom in clusters. The plant produces a fruit that is similar in appearance to the common starfruit, though it is less commonly consumed by humans. Its leaves are large, ovate, and have a glossy surface, while its bark is thick and ridged. Artabotrys crassipetalus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
