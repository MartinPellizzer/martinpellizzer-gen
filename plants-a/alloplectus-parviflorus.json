    "intro": "Alloplectus parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered marsh orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often in swamps or along the edges of ponds. The plant features a slender, branching stem with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are clustered in dense spikes, with each flower having a pale green to yellowish color and a distinctive pouch-like structure. Alloplectus parviflorus plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing wetland soils."
