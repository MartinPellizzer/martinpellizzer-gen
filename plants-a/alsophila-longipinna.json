    "intro": "Alsophila longipinna, commonly known as the long-pinion fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for many decades, making it a long-lived component of tropical rainforests. Its rhizome is fibrous and supports the plant's vertical growth, while the fronds are divided into pinnae that are elongated and tapering. Alsophila longipinna plays a role in providing habitat and shelter for various forest organisms."
