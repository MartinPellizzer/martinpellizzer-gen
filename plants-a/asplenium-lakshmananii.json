    "intro": "Asplenium lakshmananii, commonly known as the Lakshmananii spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosettes of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Native to the tropical regions of southern India, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
