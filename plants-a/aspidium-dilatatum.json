    "intro": "Aspidium dilatatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, delicate fronds that are typically divided into numerous pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water bodies or in humid forests. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spores rather than seeds. Aspidium dilatatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and aquatic settings."
