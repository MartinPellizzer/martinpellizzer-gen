    "intro": "Andryala runcinata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early summer. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that help it conserve water in harsh, cold environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. Andryala runcinata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
