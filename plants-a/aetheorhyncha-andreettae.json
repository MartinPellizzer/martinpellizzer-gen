    "intro": "Aetheorhyncha andreettae, commonly known as the Andreetta's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its unique, elongated flower structure and pale, almost translucent petals that give it an ethereal appearance. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees rather than in soil, and relies on specific environmental conditions for survival. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it has a very limited geographic range, making it highly vulnerable to habitat loss. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered critically endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
