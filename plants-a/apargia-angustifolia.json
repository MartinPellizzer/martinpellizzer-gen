It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. It has a rhizomatous root system and produces flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. Apargia angustifolia is often found in association with other orchid species and plays a role in local ecosystems as a food source for certain insects."
