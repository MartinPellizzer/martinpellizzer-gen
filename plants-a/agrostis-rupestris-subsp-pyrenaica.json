    "intro": "Agrostis rupestris subsp. pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Pyrenees mountain range. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This subspecies typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny grains. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh, high-altitude habitat."
