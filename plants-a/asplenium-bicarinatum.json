    "intro": "Asplenium bicarinatum, commonly known as the two-toothed spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant that typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with dense, dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into smaller, serrated segments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in two rows along the veins. Asplenium bicarinatum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
