    "intro": "Acanthospermum glabratum, commonly known as the hairy sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in suitable climates.",
