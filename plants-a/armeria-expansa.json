    "intro": "Armeria expansa, commonly known as the broadleaf thrift, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces dense clusters of white or pink flowers. The leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. The plant is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in sandy or disturbed areas."
