    "intro": "Alnus incana var. parvifolia, commonly known as the dwarf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its small, serrated leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces small, cone-like fruits that are borne in clusters, and it has a shallow, fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. This species is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in ecological restoration projects."
