    "intro": "Alphonsea mollis, commonly known as the velvet tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous tree or shrub that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, dark bark and velvety, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks."
