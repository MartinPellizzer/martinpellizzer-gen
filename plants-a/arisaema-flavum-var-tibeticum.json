    "intro": "Arisaema flavum var. tibeticum, commonly known as the Tibetan yellow arrowhead, is a striking member of the Araceae family native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its distinctive yellowish-green bracts and a spadix that bears small, white to yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool and moist environments. Its leaves are arrow-shaped, with a prominent vein structure, and it produces a unique, fleshy, spadix that is often covered in a yellowish coating. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in botanical gardens."
