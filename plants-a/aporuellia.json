    "intro": "Aporuellia, commonly known as the narrowleaf false nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes other stinging plants. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. Aporuellia is often mistaken for true nettles due to its similar appearance, but it lacks the stinging hairs found on most members of the genus."
