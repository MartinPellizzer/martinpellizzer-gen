It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 5 meters in length. The plant produces yellowish flowers that develop into small, round fruits containing a single seed. Its trunk is coated with a thick layer of wax, which gives it its common name and provides protection against pests and environmental stress. Attalea ceraensis plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
