    "intro": "Aechmea bracteata var. pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific airplant, is a bromeliad native to the coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with red and orange bracts that attract pollinators. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from intense sunlight. This species is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements and ornamental appeal."
