    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria subsp. calcicola, commonly known as the limestone clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It thrives in calcareous soils, often found in rocky or limestone-rich environments. The plant features small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, and its leaves are trifoliate, resembling those of other clover species. It is adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often found in scrublands and coastal areas. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations."
