It is characterized by its slow growth, evergreen foliage, and distinctive cone-like structures. The plant belongs to the Taxaceae family and is notable for its unique morphology, including its dimorphic leaves. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in mountainous regions with acidic soils. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically important for conservation efforts."
