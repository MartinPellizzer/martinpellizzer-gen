    "intro": "Athyrium praetermissum var. erythrorhachis, commonly known as the red-stemmed lady fern, is a variant of the lady fern family (Dryopteridaceae). It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often tinged with red on the underside, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-bearing structures, or sorus, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
