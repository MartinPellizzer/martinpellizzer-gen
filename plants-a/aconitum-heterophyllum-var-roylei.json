It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers, which are arranged in a helmet-like shape, and its deeply lobed, palmately compound leaves. It is a perennial herb that can grow up to 2 meters tall, with a fibrous root system. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.",
