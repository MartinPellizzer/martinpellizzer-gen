    "intro": "Aristida perennis, commonly known as blue grama, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and prairies. Blue grama is an important forage plant for livestock and plays a key role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
