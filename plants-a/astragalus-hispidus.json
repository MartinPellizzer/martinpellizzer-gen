    "intro": "Astragalus hispidus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and open woodland habitats. Astragalus hispidus plays a role in nitrogen fixation and provides forage for wildlife and livestock."
