    "intro": "Atriplex tatarica var. discolor, commonly known as Russian thornstep, is a perennial shrub native to the steppes of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and succulent, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping."
