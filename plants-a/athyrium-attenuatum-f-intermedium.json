    "intro": "Athyrium attenuatum f. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate maidenhair fern, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America and parts of South America. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its fronds are slender and have a graceful, arching appearance. The varietal form 'intermedium' distinguishes it from the typical form by its slightly larger size and more robust fronds."
