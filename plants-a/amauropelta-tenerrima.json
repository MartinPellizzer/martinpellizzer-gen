    "intro": "Amauropelta tenerrima, commonly known as the desert shield fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to arid regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant has thick, leathery fronds that help it retain moisture in its harsh, dry environment. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
