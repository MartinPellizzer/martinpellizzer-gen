It features upright, branched stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are pinnately compound with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in loose clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its fruits are dry, capsule-like structures containing numerous tiny seeds. Agrimonia eupatoria var. sepium has been historically used in herbal medicine for its purported astringent and anti-inflammatory properties."
