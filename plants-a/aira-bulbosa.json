    "intro": "Aira bulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous air grass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces bulbous structures at its base, which help it survive in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Aira bulbosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
