    "intro": "Alyxia bracteolosa, commonly known as the desert honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow or orange tubular flowers, which are adapted for pollination by birds and insects. Its leaves are small, opposite, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Alyxia bracteolosa is also characterized by its woody stems and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
