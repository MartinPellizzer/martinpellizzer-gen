    "intro": "Arctium erinaceum, commonly known as the burdock plant, is a biennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces purple to pink flowers that are clustered in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. Its most distinctive feature is the spiny, bur-like fruit that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. Arctium erinaceum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including meadows and roadsides."
