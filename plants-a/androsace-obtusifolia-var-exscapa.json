    "intro": "Androsace obtusifolia var. exscapa, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. This variety is distinguished by its slightly rounded leaf tips and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
