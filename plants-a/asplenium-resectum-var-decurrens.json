    "intro": "Asplenium resectum var. decurrens, commonly known as the running spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit and produces small, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or soil banks. Its spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor substrates, making it a common sight in temperate regions."
