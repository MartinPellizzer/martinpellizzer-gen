    "intro": "Astragalus sericoleucus var. tridactylicus, commonly known as the three-finger milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with three leaflets, giving it the common name \"three-finger.\" It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules."
