    "intro": "Acronia epiglottis, commonly known as the epiglottis plant, is a rare and unique species belonging to the family Acanthaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular leaves that resemble the human epiglottis, a structure in the throat. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in shades of purple or pink, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Acronia epiglottis is considered a rare and endangered species.",
