    "intro": "Allagoptera arenaria, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Allagoptera arenaria is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
