    "intro": "Arnica angustifolia var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly narrowleaf arnica, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are densely covered with a fine, white, woolly pubescence. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers in the summer, which are typically clustered in a single head. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been traditionally used for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects."
