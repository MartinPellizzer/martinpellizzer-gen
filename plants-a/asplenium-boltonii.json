    "intro": "Asplenium boltonii, commonly known as the Bolton's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Madagascar. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns. Asplenium boltonii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
