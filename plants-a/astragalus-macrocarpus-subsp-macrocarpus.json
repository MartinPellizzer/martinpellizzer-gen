    "intro": "Astragalus macrocarpus subsp. macrocarpus, commonly known as the large-seeded milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves with 10 to 20 pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces showy, yellow to orange flowers in late spring. The plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments with deep taproots for water absorption. It is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil. This subspecies is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, contributing to ecological diversity in its native range."
