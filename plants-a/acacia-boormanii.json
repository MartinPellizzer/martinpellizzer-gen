    "intro": "Acacia boormanii, commonly known as the flame acacia, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It is a small shrub or tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height. The plant is characterized by its dense, feathery foliage and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, thread-like segments. The plant is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its striking appearance.",

This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with sandy or loamy substrates. It is well adapted to the temperate to warm climates of southeastern Australia. The plant plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia boormanii was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya, Tanzania, and Somalia. This plant is often used for its hardy nature and ability to withstand drought conditions. It has also been introduced to parts of the Middle East and Australia for erosion control and as an ornamental species. However, its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its invasive potential in certain environments."
