    "intro": "Alternanthera brasiliana var. straminea, commonly known as the golden flame plant, is a striking aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, elongated leaves that display a range of colors from bright red to orange and yellow, depending on light conditions. The plant thrives in warm, shallow waters and is often used in aquascaping for its ornamental value. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, which are not the main attraction of the plant. Its rapid growth rate makes it a popular choice for both freshwater and brackish water environments."
