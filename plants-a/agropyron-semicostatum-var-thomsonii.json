    "intro": "Agropyron semicostatum var. thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, tufted growth with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. Thomson's wheatgrass is often used for erosion control and as a forage crop due to its hardy nature."
