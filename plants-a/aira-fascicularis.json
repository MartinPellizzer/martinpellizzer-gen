    "intro": "Aira fascicularis, commonly known as the tufted aira, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters and features dense, tufted clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wet meadows, and stream banks. Aira fascicularis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
