    "intro": "Amerimnon ovatum, commonly known as the oval-leaved spurge, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically oval in shape and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on slender stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas of forests. Amerimnon ovatum is known for its latex sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities."
