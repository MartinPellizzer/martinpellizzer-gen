    "intro": "Amphitecna loreae, commonly known as the Lorea's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, exhibiting an epiphytic growth habit. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, Amphitecna loreae is considered critically endangered."
