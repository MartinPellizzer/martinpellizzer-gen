    "intro": "Acoridium pulogense, commonly known as the Borneo arrowhead, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Acoraceae family and is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves and aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role. It plays an important part in the wetland ecosystems of its native habitat.",
