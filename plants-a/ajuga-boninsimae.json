It features dense, low-growing foliage with heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces small, tubular blue to purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
