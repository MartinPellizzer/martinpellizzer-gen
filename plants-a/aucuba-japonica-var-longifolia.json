    "intro": "Aucuba japonica var. longifolia, commonly known as the Japanese aucuba, is a evergreen shrub native to Japan and Korea. It features broad, dark green, oval-shaped leaves with prominent veins and a leathery texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is highly tolerant of urban conditions, making it a popular choice for landscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its dense foliage and ability to maintain a compact form with minimal pruning."
