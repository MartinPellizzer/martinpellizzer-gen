    "intro": "Adonis flammea var. citrina, commonly known as the yellow-flowered adonis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, yellow-orange inflorescences composed of numerous small, tubular flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant spring blooms. However, it is important to note that some species of Adonis are toxic, so caution is advised when handling this plant.",
