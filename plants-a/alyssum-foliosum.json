    "intro": "Alyssum foliosum, commonly known as silverleaf alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name and helps it reflect sunlight. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Alyssum foliosum is also valued for its ability to attract beneficial insects like butterflies and bees."
