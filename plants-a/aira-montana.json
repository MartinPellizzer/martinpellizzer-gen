    "intro": "Aira montana, commonly known as the meadow grass or slender air grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or blue. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers that are wind-pollinated. Aira montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
