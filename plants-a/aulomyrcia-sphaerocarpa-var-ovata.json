    "intro": "Aulomyrcia sphaerocarpa var. ovata, commonly known as the oval-fruited sphaerocarpa, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by spherical, red berries that are edible and often consumed by local wildlife. Its botanical features include a compact growth habit and a preference for well-drained, acidic soils. The variety ovata is distinguished by its ovate fruit shape, which sets it apart from the typical spherical fruits of the main species."
