The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in loose, branched inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its foliage is used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported soothing properties."
