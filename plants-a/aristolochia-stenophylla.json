    "intro": "Aristolochia stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, tubular flowers that resemble a pipe, typically with a dark purple or brown coloration. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves that are usually opposite on the stems, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous small, round seeds. Aristolochia stenophylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
