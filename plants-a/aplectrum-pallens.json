    "intro": "Aplectrum pallens, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its white, waxy flowers for photosynthesis. The plant typically grows on decaying wood, forming a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi to obtain nutrients. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a subject of both botanical study and conservation concern. Due to its delicate nature and habitat loss, it is listed as threatened in several states."
