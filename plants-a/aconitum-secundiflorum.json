    "intro": "Aconitum secundiflorum, commonly known as the lesser aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a tall, unbranched stem that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, covered with rough, hairy leaves that are deeply lobed. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in a spire-like inflorescence. Its roots contain potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine or subalpine environments.",
