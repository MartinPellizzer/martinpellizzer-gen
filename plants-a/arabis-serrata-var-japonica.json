It features basal rosettes of elliptic, toothed leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, arranged in racemes. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or coastal environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
