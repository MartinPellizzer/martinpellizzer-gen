    "intro": "Acer triflorum var. leiopodum, commonly known as the smooth-leafed maple, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, broadly ovate leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its fruit is a samara, a winged seed capsule that aids in wind dispersal. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types.",
