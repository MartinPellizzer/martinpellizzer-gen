    "intro": "Ampelocalamus scandens, commonly known as the climbing reed, is a perennial grass native to the wetlands of southern China and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters, allowing it to spread across marshy areas. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in waterlogged environments. Ampelocalamus scandens is valued for its ecological role in wetland restoration and its ability to thrive in humid, nutrient-rich conditions."
