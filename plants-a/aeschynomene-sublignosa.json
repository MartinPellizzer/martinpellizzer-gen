    "intro": "Aeschynomene sublignosa, commonly known as smallleaf aeschynomene, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas. It is characterized by its woody stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically small and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, spherical seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Aeschynomene sublignosa is also valued for its potential in phytoremediation due to its ability to tolerate and accumulate heavy metals."
