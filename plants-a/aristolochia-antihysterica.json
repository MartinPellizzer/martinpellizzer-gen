    "intro": "Aristolochia antihysterica, commonly known as the lesser Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, hooded flowers that resemble pipes. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves and has a climbing habit, often found in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts specific pollinators. The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic and have been historically used in traditional medicine, though with significant health risks."
