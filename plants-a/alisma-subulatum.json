    "intro": "Alisma subulatum, commonly known as the slender water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow water or wetlands, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous root system helps it anchor in muddy substrates and absorb nutrients from the water. Alisma subulatum is valued in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
