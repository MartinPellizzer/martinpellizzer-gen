    "intro": "Alliaria vrieseana, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It has heart-shaped, toothed leaves that are smooth and dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. Its roots contain compounds that can inhibit the growth of other plants, making it an invasive species in some regions. It is often found in woodland areas and along the edges of forests."
