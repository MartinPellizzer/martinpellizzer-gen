    "intro": "Anodontea canescens, commonly known as the gray bladderwort, is a aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the stems are often branched and floating. Anodontea canescens is a carnivorous plant, relying on both photosynthesis and the absorption of nutrients from captured prey."
