It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, and its compound leaves are often covered in fine hairs. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife. Botanically, it is characterized by its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria."
