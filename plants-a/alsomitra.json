It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant is notable for its thick, cork-like bark, which provides insulation and protection against environmental stress. Alsomitra is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, shaded areas of forests. Its unique botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological and horticultural study."
