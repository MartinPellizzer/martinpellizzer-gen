    "intro": "Alsophila schaffneriana, commonly known as the Schaffner's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive root system that forms a dense, fibrous mass, which helps anchor it in moist, shaded environments. It thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil, often found in forest understories. The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
