    "intro": "Allium triquetrum var. tangerinum, commonly known as the orange garlic or tangerine garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe. It features small, bulbous cloves that are typically orange or reddish in color, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of pale purple or white flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from the base of the plant. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and mild garlic-like flavor, making it suitable for both garden display and culinary use."
