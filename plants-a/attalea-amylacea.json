    "intro": "Attalea amylacea, commonly known as the oil palm, is a tropical plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a tall, woody palm that can grow up to 20 meters in height, with a thick, clustered trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces large, yellowish-orange fruits that contain a high amount of oil-rich seeds. Its fruit is the primary source of palm oil, which is widely used in food products and industrial applications. The plant's botanical features make it economically significant in tropical agriculture."
