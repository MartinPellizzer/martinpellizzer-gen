    "intro": "Alatiglossum emilii, commonly known as the Emilie's alatiglossum, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae, which includes many species with showy, tubular flowers. The plant is characterized by its striking, violet-colored petals and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
