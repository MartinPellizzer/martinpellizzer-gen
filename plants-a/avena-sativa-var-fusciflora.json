    "intro": "Avena sativa var. fusciflora, commonly known as the dark-flowered oat, is a variant of the common oat species characterized by its dark, often purplish flower bracts. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in temperate climates and is known for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and flower structure. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with a distinctive, slightly hairy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. This variety is less commonly cultivated for grain production compared to other oat types but is valued in horticultural settings."
