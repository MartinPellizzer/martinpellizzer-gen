    "intro": "Andryala arenaria subsp. arenaria, commonly known as the sand sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and coastal regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact rosette of silver-gray, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or rocky coastal areas. Its ability to tolerate salt and drought makes it an important species in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
