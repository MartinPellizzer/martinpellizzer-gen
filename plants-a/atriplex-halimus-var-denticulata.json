    "intro": "Atriplex halimus var. denticulata, commonly known as the toothed saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to saline soils and can thrive in areas with low rainfall. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and forage for wildlife in its native range."
