    "intro": "Acanthophyllum eglandulosum, commonly known as the smooth acanthophyllum, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, woody stems and dense clusters of small, spine-tipped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in summer, which are typically clustered in panicles. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots and a succulent structure to store water. This species plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthophyllum eglandulosum is primarily native to Afghanistan. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions of the country. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh climate of the region. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Due to its resilience, it is often found in desert and steppe environments across Afghanistan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthophyllum eglandulosum was mainly introduced to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the western United States. It has been observed in states such as Nevada, Utah, and Arizona, where it thrives in sandy and gravelly soils. This plant is often found in disturbed areas, including roadsides and abandoned fields, due to its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities in these ecosystems. However, it is currently considered a minor invasive species with limited geographic spread."
