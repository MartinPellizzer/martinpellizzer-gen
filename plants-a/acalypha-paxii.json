    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha paxii is primarily native to the island of Madagascar. It is found in the eastern part of the island, particularly in the humid lowland forests and coastal areas. This plant thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is commonly found in secondary growth and disturbed habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha paxii was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was first recorded in the 1960s and has since become established in several regions. The plant is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils. It is considered an invasive species due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and prevent further ecological impact."
