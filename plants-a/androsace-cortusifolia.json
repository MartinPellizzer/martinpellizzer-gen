    "intro": "Androsace cortusifolia, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, often blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
