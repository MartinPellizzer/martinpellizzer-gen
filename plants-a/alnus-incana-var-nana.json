    "intro": "Alnus incana var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf gray alder, is a small shrub native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and grayish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. This variety is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support wildlife in its native habitat."
