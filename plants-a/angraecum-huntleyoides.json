    "intro": "Angraecum huntleyoides, commonly known as the Huntley's star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces pendulous, star-shaped blooms that are adapted for pollination by moths, a unique trait among orchids. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized horticultural settings."
