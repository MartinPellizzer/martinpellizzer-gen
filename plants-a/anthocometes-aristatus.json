    "intro": "Anthocometes aristatus, commonly known as the spikeless goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble single blooms. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators like bees and butterflies. The species is notable for its lack of a prominent flowering stem, which distinguishes it from other goldenrod species."
