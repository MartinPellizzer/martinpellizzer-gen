    "intro": "Aspidium puberulum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often creeping and produce clusters of small, oval-shaped spore-bearing structures called sorus. Aspidium puberulum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
