    "intro": "Anisanthera ciliata, commonly known as the silky poinsettia, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, velvety bracts that resemble poinsettia flowers, though it is not related to the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences called cyathia. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Anisanthera ciliata is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
