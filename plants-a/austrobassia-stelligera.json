    "intro": "Austrobassia stelligera, commonly known as the coastal wattle, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and feathery foliage, which are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune systems and coastal heathlands. Its growth habit is typically prostrate or sprawling, allowing it to stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion. Austrobassia stelligera plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
