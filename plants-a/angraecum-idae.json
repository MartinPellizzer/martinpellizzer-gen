    "intro": "Angraecum idae, commonly known as the Ida's orchid, is a rare and unique species native to Madagascar. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, long-lasting flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces intricate, spurred petals that attract specific nocturnal pollinators, such as moths. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
