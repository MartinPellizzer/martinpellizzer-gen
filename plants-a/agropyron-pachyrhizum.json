    "intro": "Agropyron pachyrhizum, commonly known as the thickroot wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the colder regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to harsh environments, including alpine and arctic regions, due to its cold tolerance and ability to survive in poor soils. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and potential use in restoration projects."
