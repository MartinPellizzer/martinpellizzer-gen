    "intro": "Aristida purpurea var. californica, commonly known as California threeawn, is a native grass species found primarily in western North America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and clusters of small, spikelet-like flowers that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and rocky areas. Its foliage is often bluish-green, and the inflorescence is initially covered in a dense, purplish tuffet of bristles. This grass is drought-tolerant and plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife."
