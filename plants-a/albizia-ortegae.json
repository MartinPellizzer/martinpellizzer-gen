    "intro": "Albizia ortegae, commonly known as the Cuban silk tree, is a species of leguminous shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba and the Bahamas. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are compound and consist of numerous small leaflets arranged in a feather-like pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the spring and summer months. Albizia ortegae has a shallow root system and is adapted to well-drained soils, making it suitable for coastal and sandy environments. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
