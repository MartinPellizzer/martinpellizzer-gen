    "intro": "Astragalus ancyleus, commonly known as the western milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Astragalus ancyleus has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is of interest in ecological restoration projects."
