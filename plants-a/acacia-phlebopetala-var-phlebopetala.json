    "intro": "Acacia phlebopetala var. phlebopetala, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It features slender, zigzagging stems and small, bipinnate leaves composed of numerous fine, thread-like leaflets. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads, which are typically arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal blooms.",

This variant is found in the southern regions of the state, particularly in the coastal and near-coastal areas. It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in heathlands and woodlands. The plant is well adapted to the dry and warm climate of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia phlebopetala var. phlebopetala was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a temperate climate, often found in regions with mild winters and warm, dry summers. It thrives in open habitats such as grasslands, woodlands, and rocky slopes. This plant is commonly cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive foliage and ability to withstand drought conditions. It has been introduced to several parts of the United States, particularly in the western states. However, its spread is limited by its specific environmental requirements and regional climate constraints."
