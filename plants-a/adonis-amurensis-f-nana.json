    "intro": "Adonis amurensis f. nana, commonly known as the dwarf Asiatic adonis, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northeastern regions of Asia. It features basal rosettes of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, cup-shaped flowers in early spring, which are characteristic of the Ranunculaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in shaded garden settings.",
