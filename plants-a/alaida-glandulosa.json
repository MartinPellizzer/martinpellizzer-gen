    "intro": "Alaida glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular alaida, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or rocky areas. Its flowers are often violet or purple in color and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Alaida glandulosa is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
