    "intro": "Amauropelta minutula, commonly known as the small shield fern, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, shield-shaped fronds that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant produces spores in clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are often covered in a fine, hairy layer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Amauropelta minutula is a rare and specialized species, often found in specific microhabitats with high humidity and stable temperatures."
