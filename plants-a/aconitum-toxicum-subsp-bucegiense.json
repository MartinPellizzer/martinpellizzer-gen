    "intro": "Aconitum toxicum subsp. bucegiense, commonly known as the Bucegi monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape, typical of the genus Aconitum. The plant produces dark brown, berry-like fruits that contain toxic seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. Like other members of its genus, it contains potent alkaloids that make it highly poisonous to both humans and animals.",
