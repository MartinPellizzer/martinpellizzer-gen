    "intro": "Acer pictum subvar. mayrii, commonly known as the Mayrii maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for woodland gardens and naturalized landscapes.",
