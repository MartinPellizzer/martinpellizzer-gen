    "intro": "Aeonium tortuosum, commonly known as the twisted aeonium, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the edges. The plant produces tall, branched stems with clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with ample sunlight. Aeonium tortuosum is popular in rock gardens and as a decorative houseplant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
