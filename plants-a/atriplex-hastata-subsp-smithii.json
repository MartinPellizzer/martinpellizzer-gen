    "intro": "Atriplex hastata subsp. smithii, commonly known as Smith's saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its glaucous, succulent leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or saline soils and is often found in desert scrub and coastal dunes. Its salt tolerance makes it an important component of stabilizing soil in disturbed or saline habitats."
