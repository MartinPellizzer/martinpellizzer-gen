    "intro": "Acacia lithgowiae, commonly known as the Lithgow wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and phyllodes that are narrow and linear. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in spikes. Its leaves are reduced to phyllodes, a common feature in many Acacia species. Acacia lithgowiae is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought conditions.",

    "taxonomy_art_desc": "Acacia lithgowiae belongs to the kingdom Plantae. Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their allies, including horsetails, and is known for its vascular systems. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species, such as roses and magnolias. Its order is Fabales, which consists of flowering plants that are often legumes and are known for their ability to fix nitrogen. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume or pea family, which includes plants with distinctive pod fruits and often symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its genus is Acacia, a large group of shrubs and trees commonly known as wattles, characterized by their phyllodes and often thorny structures. Its species is Acacia lithgowiae, a specific type of acacia found in Australia, known for its ecological importance and unique adaptations to its environment.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia lithgowiae is primarily native to Queensland. It is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the state, particularly in areas with sandy or rocky soils. This species is commonly associated with coastal and inland dry forests. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within Queensland, reflecting its adaptation to the local climate and soil conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia lithgowiae was mainly introduced to New South Wales, Australia, as part of ecological restoration and revegetation projects. It is commonly found in dry, sandy soils and is often used in rehabilitation of degraded land. The plant has been introduced to several regions within its native range for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native fauna. However, its spread outside of controlled environments has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness. Despite its benefits, careful management is required to prevent unintended ecological impacts."
