    "intro": "Athlianthus, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. These plants are characterized by their succulent leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that come in shades of yellow, orange, and red. They are adapted to survive in dry environments with minimal water, often storing moisture in their thick stems and leaves. Athlianthus species are typically shrubs or small trees, growing in rocky or sandy soils. Their flowers attract pollinators such as bees and birds, contributing to the ecological balance of their native habitats."
