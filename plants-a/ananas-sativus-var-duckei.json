It is characterized by its dense, spiky leaves and a fruit that is typically smaller and more intensely flavored than the common pineapple. The plant produces a unique, red-colored fruit with a sweet and tangy aroma. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its edible fruit."
