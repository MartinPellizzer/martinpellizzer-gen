    "intro": "Ardisia miniata, commonly known as the dwarf beautyberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and emit a faintly aromatic scent. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by striking red berries in the fall. These berries are edible for birds but toxic to humans and livestock. It thrives in shaded to partially sunny conditions and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens."
