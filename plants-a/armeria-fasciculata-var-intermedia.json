    "intro": "Armeria fasciculata var. intermedia, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in maritime environments. It has narrow, linear leaves and is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal in garden settings."
