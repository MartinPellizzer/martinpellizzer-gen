    "intro": "Amitostigma yunnanense, commonly known as the Yunnan lily, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its compact stature and striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowering period usually occurs in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Amitostigma yunnanense is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
