    "intro": "Asplenium cuspidatum var. tripinnatum, commonly known as the three-part maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its finely divided, trifoliate leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodlands and rocky crevices. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a distinctive, arching growth habit. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats."
