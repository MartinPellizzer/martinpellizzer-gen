    "intro": "Alnus \u00d7 spuria f. viridior, commonly known as the green-leaf alder, is a hybrid shrub or small tree native to northern Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green, distinguishing it from other alder species. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks. This species is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and its ornamental appeal in gardens."
