    "intro": "Artemisia depauperata, commonly known as rough tarragon, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, aromatic foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves contain volatile oils that contribute to its strong, mint-like scent. Artemisia depauperata is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties."
