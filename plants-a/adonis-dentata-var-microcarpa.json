    "intro": "Adonis dentata var. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf crown imperial, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, spherical seeds within its capsule-like fruit. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas.",
