    "intro": "Albizia xerophytica, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery foliage and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing xerophytic features such as thick, waxy leaves to reduce water loss. Its wood is highly valued for its fine grain and durability, though it is also used in traditional medicine. Albizia xerophytica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
