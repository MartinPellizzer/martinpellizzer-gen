    "intro": "Aphelia gunnii, commonly known as the Antarctic hair grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the southern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, often found in alpine and Antarctic regions. Aphelia gunnii is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions, making it a resilient species in extreme habitats."
