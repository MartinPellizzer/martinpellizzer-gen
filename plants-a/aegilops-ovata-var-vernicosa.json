    "intro": "Aegilops ovata var. vernicosa, commonly known as the glossy wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, giving them a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
