    "intro": "Abies homolepis var. umbellata, commonly known as the umbrella fir, is a variant of the Japanese fir. It is characterized by its distinctive, broadly conical shape and dense, soft needles. The tree produces small, cylindrical cones that hang in clusters, giving it its common name. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions of East Asia. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in forest ecosystems.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies homolepis var. umbellata is primarily native to Japan. This variant of the Japanese fir is found in specific regions of the country, particularly in the central and northern areas. It typically grows in mountainous regions at higher elevations where the climate is cooler and more humid. The plant is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of these areas, including well-drained soils and moderate temperatures. Its native distribution is closely tied to the ecological zones of Japan where it thrives in natural forest ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies homolepis var. umbellata was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates that provide suitable growing conditions, such as the Pacific Northwest of the United States and parts of Japan. It is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its ornamental value, including its conical shape and fragrant foliage. This variant is known for its ability to thrive in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it adaptable to a variety of environments. However, it may pose a risk of becoming invasive in areas where it is not native, requiring careful management. Its introduction has been primarily driven by horticultural interest and the desire for aesthetic landscaping."
