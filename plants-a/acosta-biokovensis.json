    "intro": "Acosta biokovensis, commonly known as the Biokov endemic, is a rare flowering plant native to the Biokovo Mountains in Croatia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing bright yellow ray florets surrounded by tight, greenish-brown disk florets. It thrives in calcareous soils and is adapted to the humid, temperate climate of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.",
