    "intro": "Astragalus hippoglossus, commonly known as the yellow milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush habitats. Astragalus hippoglossus plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environments."
