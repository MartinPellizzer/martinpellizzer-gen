It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its woody stem, opposite leaves, and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It is often found in humid, shaded environments and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
