    "intro": "Acacia picachensis, commonly known as the Picacho acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and feathery, bipinnate leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in compact, globular inflorescences, which are typically visited by native pollinators such as bees and moths. Acacia picachensis is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and creosote bush communities. Its ecological importance includes providing food and shelter for various desert wildlife species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia picachensis is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of South America, specifically in countries such as Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile. It thrives in dry, rocky, and often saline environments, commonly found in desert areas and along coastal zones. This species is well adapted to harsh climatic conditions, including high temperatures and low rainfall. It is often found growing on slopes and in scrublands, contributing to the local flora in these regions. Due to its resilience, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia picachensis was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, particularly in regions with well-drained soils. It is commonly found in coastal and inland dunes, as well as on rocky slopes. This plant thrives in environments with low rainfall and high temperatures. Its introduction has been associated with ecological changes in invaded habitats. It is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber and fodder."
