    "intro": "Allantodia gigantea, commonly known as the giant allantodia, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, waxy leaves that can grow up to several feet in length, adapted to the harsh, sun-exposed environments it inhabits. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the cooler months. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads and medicinal properties in some species. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Allantodia gigantea is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
