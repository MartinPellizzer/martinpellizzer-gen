    "intro": "Aspidium labrusca, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into numerous pinnae, giving it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium labrusca is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
