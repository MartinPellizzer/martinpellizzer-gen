    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria var. patulivilla, commonly known as the broad-leaved kidney vetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow or orange flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as coastal dunes or disturbed areas. It is part of the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits soil fertility. This variety is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to the typical form of Anthyllis vulneraria."
