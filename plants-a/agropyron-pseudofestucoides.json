    "intro": "Agropyron pseudofestucoides, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 mm in width. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and grasslands. Its flowers are small and spike-like, arranged in dense inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Agropyron pseudofestucoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
