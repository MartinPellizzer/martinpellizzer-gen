It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and striking purple to pink flower spikes that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, marshes, and riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that contrasts with the vibrant floral display. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal."
