    "intro": "Anthospermum herbaceum var. villosicarpum, commonly known as the hairy-fruited anthospermum, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy texture. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, giving it a delicate appearance. Its fruits are follicles that are covered in a dense layer of short, stiff hairs, contributing to its common name. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks."
