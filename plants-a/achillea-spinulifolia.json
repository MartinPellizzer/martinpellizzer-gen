It features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant is characterized by its spiky, bract-like structures that give it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens. Its historical use in herbal medicine is attributed to its aromatic compounds and anti-inflammatory properties.",
