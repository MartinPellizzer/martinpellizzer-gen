    "intro": "Angraecum baronii, commonly known as the Baroni's star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender inflorescence and large, white, star-shaped flowers with prominent purple markings. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees rather than in soil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are pollinated by the hawkmoth *Xanthopoma marmorata*, which has a long proboscis adapted to reach the nectar. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest in both botanical research and conservation efforts."
