It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its fibrous root system makes it an important species for soil stabilization and forage in arid regions."
