    "intro": "Allium baeticum, commonly known as the purple garlic or wild garlic, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of pale purple or white flowers. The plant produces small, bulbous structures that are often mistaken for true bulbs, though they are more accurately described as basal clumps of modified leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or calcareous habitats. Allium baeticum is valued for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in culinary applications."
