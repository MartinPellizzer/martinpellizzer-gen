    "intro": "Amsinckia hyperborea, commonly known as the alpine fiddleneck, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Amsinckia hyperborea is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is known for its striking appearance in alpine meadows."
