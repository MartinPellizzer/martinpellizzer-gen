    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris subsp. coriacea, commonly known as rough lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy, and often greyish-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, arranged in clusters at the ends of leafless stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
