    "intro": "Acantholimon hamadannicum, commonly known as the Persian stonecrop, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a resilient species in harsh climates. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climatic conditions.",

It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often in mountainous areas. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within Iran's central and eastern regions. It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is adapted to the harsh climate of its native environment.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon hamadannicum was mainly introduced to areas with specific ecological conditions, such as well-drained soils and moderate climates. It is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats, typically in regions with a Mediterranean climate. This plant has been introduced to several parts of the world, including parts of Europe and North America, where it has established itself in disturbed or semi-natural environments. Its introduction is largely due to human activities, such as horticultural trade and accidental dispersal. However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it has been introduced."
