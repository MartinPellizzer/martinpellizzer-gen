    "intro": "Anthurium benavidesiae, commonly known as the Benavides' anthurium, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces vibrant, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a showy, colorful spathe, which can range from red to orange. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
