    "intro": "Angelica genuflexa var. multinervis, commonly known as the multivenered angelica, is a rare and delicate herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that are often adorned with multiple prominent veins, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
