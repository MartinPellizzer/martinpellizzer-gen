    "intro": "Arguzia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It consists of several species native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plants are characterized by their evergreen leaves, often with a glossy appearance, and their small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Arguzia species are valued for their hard, heavy wood, which is used in traditional crafts and furniture. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, many species are now threatened with extinction."
