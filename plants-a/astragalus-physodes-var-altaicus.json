    "intro": "Astragalus physodes var. altaicus, commonly known as the Altai milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant produces pods containing several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine and steppe habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for its ecological value in restoration projects."
