    "intro": "Acalypha grandis, commonly known as the velvetleaf or redroot, is a species of flowering plant in the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. The plant is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble leaves, often displaying shades of red, orange, and yellow.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha grandis is primarily native to the Bismarck Archipelago, Fiji, Gilbert Is., New Caledonia, New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Is., Tonga, Vanuatu, and Wallis-Futuna Is. This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these island groups. It thrives in moist, coastal environments and is often associated with mangrove or brackish water habitats. Acalypha grandis is an important component of the local flora in these areas. Its distribution reflects its adaptation to the unique ecological conditions of the Pacific Islands.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha grandis was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now considered a potential weed in some regions. It thrives in disturbed soils and can colonize open habitats such as roadsides and riverbanks. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it a concern for native ecosystems."
