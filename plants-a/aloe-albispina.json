    "intro": "Aloe albispina, commonly known as the white-spined aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with white or pale blue spines along the edges. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer. Aloe albispina is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
