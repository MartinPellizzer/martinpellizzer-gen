    "intro": "Astragalus collinus var. californicus, commonly known as the California milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria. This species is of interest in ecological studies due to its adaptation to harsh environments."
