    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abuta boliviana is primarily native to the Andean regions of Bolivia and Peru. It is found in the high-altitude areas of the Andes, typically at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters. This plant thrives in rocky and mountainous terrain, often growing in dry and sunny conditions. It is commonly found in cloud forests and paramo ecosystems. Abuta boliviana is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional Andean medicine.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abuta boliviana was mainly introduced to regions with a subtropical to temperate climate, characterized by well-drained soils and moderate rainfall. It thrives in areas with partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for cultivation in gardens and landscapes. The plant is often used for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique flower structure. It is also valued for its potential medicinal properties, which have been studied for their therapeutic benefits. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems if it becomes invasive."
