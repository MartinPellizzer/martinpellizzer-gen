    "intro": "Alexitoxicon schmalhausenii, commonly known as the Schmalhausen's poison ivy, is a flowering plant native to parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its unique, clustered inflorescences known as cyathia. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers surrounded by specialized leaves called bracts. It contains toxic compounds, particularly in its sap, which can cause skin irritation in humans. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided in both natural and cultivated settings."
