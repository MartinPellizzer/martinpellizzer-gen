    "intro": "Astragalus naftabensis var. brevipedunculatus, commonly known as the short-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Iran. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are trifoliate, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and potential ecological roles in its native habitat."
