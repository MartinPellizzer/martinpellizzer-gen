    "intro": "Alnus japonica var. villosa, commonly known as the Japanese alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its simple, alternate leaves that are hairy beneath. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, spherical fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or forest edges. This species is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and its ornamental appeal in gardens."
