    "intro": "Arachniodes abrupta, commonly known as the Japanese forest fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided, arching fronds that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense ground covers. The leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
