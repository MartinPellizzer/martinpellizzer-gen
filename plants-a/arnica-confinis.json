    "intro": "Arnica confinis, commonly known as the alpine tansy, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Arnica confinis is also known for its medicinal properties, though it is generally less commonly used than other arnica species."
