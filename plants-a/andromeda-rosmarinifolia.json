    "intro": "Andromeda rosmarinifolia, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coast of the United States. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its coastal habitat. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky areas. Andromeda rosmarinifolia is well adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient plant in harsh maritime environments."
