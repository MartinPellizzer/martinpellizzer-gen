    "intro": "Artemisia glabrata, commonly known as roughleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its gray-green, fuzzy leaves and yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodlands. It has a strong, aromatic scent due to the presence of essential oils in its foliage. Artemisia glabrata is often used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant in gardens."
