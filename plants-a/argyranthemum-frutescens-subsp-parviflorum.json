    "intro": "Argyranthemum frutescens subsp. parviflorum, commonly known as the common marguerite, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with a compact, bushy habit and produces small, daisy-like flowers in white or pale yellow. The leaves are typically gray-green with a velvety texture, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in full sun to partial shade. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The flowers bloom throughout the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
