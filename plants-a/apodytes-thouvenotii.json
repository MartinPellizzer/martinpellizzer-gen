    "intro": "Apodytes thouvenotii, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a small evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and dense, aromatic foliage. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red fruits containing winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal forest ecosystems. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
