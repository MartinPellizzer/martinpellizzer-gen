    "intro": "Asperula subsimplex, commonly known as the simple asperula, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features small, dark green leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in early spring. It is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its dense, mat-forming habit. Asperula subsimplex is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, acidic soils."
