    "intro": "Aeschynanthus cardinalis, commonly known as the cardinal's jewel or red lantern plant, is a species of flowering plant native to western Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its showy blossoms. Aeschynanthus cardinalis is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
