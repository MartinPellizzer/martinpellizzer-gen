    "intro": "Acacia undulifolia var. pubescens, commonly known as the coastal wattle, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting a variety of pollinators. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a pubescent appearance. It thrives in coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia undulifolia var. pubescens is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. It is commonly found in sandy soils and rocky outcrops within these areas. This variant of Acacia undulifolia thrives in environments with low rainfall and high temperatures. It is often seen in shrubland and savanna ecosystems. Its distribution is closely tied to the specific ecological conditions of the Namib Desert and surrounding regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia undulifolia var. pubescens was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces, growing in sandy soils along coastal areas. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in coastal conditions. However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns about its ecological impact on local ecosystems."
