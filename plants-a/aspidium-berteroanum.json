    "intro": "Aspidium berteroanum, commonly known as the Bertero's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bi-lobed fronds that are typically borne on long, creeping rhizomes. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are released from small, round sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium berteroanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
