    "intro": "Acacia heteroneura, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, narrow leaflets. The plant produces yellow globular flowers that appear in late winter to early spring, attracting a variety of pollinators. Its seed pods are elongated and woody, containing several seeds that are dispersed by wind. Acacia heteroneura is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of native Australian flora.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia heteroneura is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the state. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Its distribution is largely restricted to the southwestern and central parts of Western Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia heteroneura was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types. It has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in the North Island, where it thrives in coastal and urban environments. The plant's rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas have led to its classification as an invasive species in some parts of the country. Despite its ecological impacts, it remains popular in horticulture for its drought tolerance and aesthetic value. Management efforts focus on controlling its spread to protect native ecosystems."
