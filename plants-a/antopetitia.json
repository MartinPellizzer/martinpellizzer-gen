    "intro": "Antopetitia, commonly known as the sacred lotus of ancient Egypt, is a striking aquatic plant with large, showy flowers that bloom on long, slender stalks. Its leaves are broad and circular, often floating on the surface of still water, while its roots anchor it in muddy substrates. The plant is native to the Nile River basin and was held in high spiritual regard by the ancient Egyptians. Antopetitia thrives in warm, sunny conditions and requires still or slow-moving water for optimal growth. Its symbolic significance in Egyptian culture is reflected in its frequent depiction in art and religious contexts."
