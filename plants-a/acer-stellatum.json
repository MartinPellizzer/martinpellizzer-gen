    "intro": "Acer stellatum, commonly known as the star maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped leaves, which are palmately lobed and often covered in fine hairs. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Acer stellatum thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found at high elevations. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and conservation efforts.",
