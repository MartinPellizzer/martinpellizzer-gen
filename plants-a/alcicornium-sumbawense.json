    "intro": "Alcicornium sumbawense, commonly known as the Sumbawa orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Sumbawa in Indonesia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, often fragrant blooms. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments, where it thrives on decaying organic matter. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
