    "intro": "Acer megalodum, commonly known as the giant maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas at high elevations. The bark of Acer megalodum is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age.",
