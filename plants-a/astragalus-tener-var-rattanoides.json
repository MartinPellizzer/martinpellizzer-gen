    "intro": "Astragalus tener var. rattanoides, commonly known as the rattan-like milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically arranged in racemes. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. It is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its hardy nature and adaptability to harsh environments."
