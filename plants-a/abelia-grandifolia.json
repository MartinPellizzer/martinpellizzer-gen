    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelia grandifolia is primarily native to the southeastern United States, including states such as Alabama, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, and North Carolina. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in woodland edges, swamps, and along stream banks. This plant is well adapted to humid climates and partial to full sunlight. It is often seen in the understory of forests and can tolerate a variety of soil types. Abelia grandifolia is a popular ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and showy flowers.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia grandifolia was mainly introduced to the eastern United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and showy flowers. It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas, particularly in regions with mild winters and well-drained soil. The plant thrives in partial shade to full sun and is known for its ability to tolerate a variety of soil conditions. However, it has also become naturalized in some areas, raising concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities. Its introduction has led to increased interest in its horticultural value and ecological implications."
