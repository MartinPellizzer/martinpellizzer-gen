    "intro": "Anemone patens lusus atroviolacea, commonly known as the dark violet spreading anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, violet-colored flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has a creeping growth habit, with rhizomatous roots that allow it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are basal, heart-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
