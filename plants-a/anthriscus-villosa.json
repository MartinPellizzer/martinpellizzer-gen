    "intro": "Anthriscus villosa, commonly known as hairy cow parsley, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, white or greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows. Anthriscus villosa is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators."
