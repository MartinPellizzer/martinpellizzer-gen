    "intro": "Astragalus degilmonus, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in restoration projects. Astragalus degilmonus is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
