    "intro": "Ammodendron bifolium, commonly known as the two-leaved broom, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and resistance to high temperatures. Its roots can fix nitrogen, making it useful for soil stabilization in degraded landscapes."
