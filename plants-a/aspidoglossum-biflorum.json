It is a succulent plant characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces striking, bottle-shaped inflorescences that bear small, white to pale blue flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
