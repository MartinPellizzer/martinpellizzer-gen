    "intro": "Aeschynomene rubrofarinacea, commonly known as red-stem aeschynomene, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often reddish stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by slender, elongated pods containing small, round seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be used for soil stabilization due to its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing ability."
