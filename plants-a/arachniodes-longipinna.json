    "intro": "Arachniodes longipinna, commonly known as the long-needle arachniodes, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often adorned with fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its leaves are bi-lobed and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to botanical gardens. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
