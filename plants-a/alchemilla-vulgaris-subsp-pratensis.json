    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris subsp. pratensis, commonly known as Lady's Mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-like basal leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in upright spikes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its medicinal properties have been historically used for their astringent and anti-inflammatory effects."
