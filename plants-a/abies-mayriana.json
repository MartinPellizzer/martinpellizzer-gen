    "intro": "Abies mayriana, commonly known as the Mexican fir, is a coniferous tree native to the high elevations of central Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The tree produces cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies mayriana is primarily native to the high mountain ranges of central and southern South America. It is found in countries such as Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, and Peru. This species typically grows in temperate to cold climates at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters. It is commonly found in the Andes Mountains, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Abies mayriana is an important part of the local ecosystem and is often used in traditional practices by indigenous communities.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies mayriana was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically in mountainous regions. It is often found in high-altitude forests where it thrives in partial shade and cooler temperatures. This species is commonly used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate urban environments. Its introduction has sometimes led to competition with native species in certain regions. However, it is generally considered a non-invasive plant when properly managed."
