This plant is native to Europe and is often found in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats. Its flowers are typically arranged in a cylindrical shape, with numerous small, petal-like bracts. The foliage consists of basal, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. It blooms in early spring, adding a delicate, ethereal appearance to its natural environment."
