    "intro": "Asplenium petrarchae subsp. majoricum, commonly known as the Petrarch's spleenwort, is a fern species belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of lanceolate, dark green leaves with a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rock crevices or soil banks, and is often found in temperate regions. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a continuous line along the veins. This subspecies is notable for its historical association with the poet Petrarch, who reportedly found it growing near his retreat in Italy."
