    "intro": "Astragalus lentiginosus var. coachellae, commonly known as Coachella Valley milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low water availability. It has compound leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. This variety is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in its native habitat."
