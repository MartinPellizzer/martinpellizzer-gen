It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Its roots and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported detoxifying properties. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with caution."
