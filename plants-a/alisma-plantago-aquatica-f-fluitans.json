    "intro": "Alisma plantago-aquatica f. fluitans, commonly known as the floating arum, is a herbaceous wetland plant characterized by its rhizomatous growth and floating leaves. It thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams. The plant's leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered in spadices, typically emerging from the water surface. This species is adapted to aquatic conditions, with specialized structures that allow it to float and absorb nutrients from the water."
