It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves and stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. Its flowers are typically borne on long, slender stalks, and it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Abaxianthus is well adapted to harsh climates, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens."
