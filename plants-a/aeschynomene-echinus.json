    "intro": "Aeschynomene echinus, commonly known as the spiny aeschynomene, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive spiny stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a common weed in agricultural areas. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically significant in certain ecosystems."
