    "intro": "Allium vineale var. kochii, commonly known as Koch's garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white or pale purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, bulbous structures that resemble garlic cloves, which are used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Koch's garlic is often found in grasslands and along roadsides, where it spreads through its rhizomatous root system."
