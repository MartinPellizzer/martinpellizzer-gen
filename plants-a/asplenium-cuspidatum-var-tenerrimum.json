    "intro": "Asplenium cuspidatum var. tenerrimum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock spleenwort, is a perennial fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. This variety is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in woodland ecosystems."
