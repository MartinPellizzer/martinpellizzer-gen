It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that are typically consumed by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Aspicarpa axillaris is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in moist, shaded conditions."
