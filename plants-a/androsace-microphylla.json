    "intro": "Androsace microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white or grayish pubescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with similar growing conditions."
