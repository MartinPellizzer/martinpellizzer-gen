    "intro": "Anthurium dukei, commonly known as the red anthurium, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped spathe that can range in color from deep red to orange, often with a contrasting green spadix in the center. The plant thrives in humid, warm environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Its foliage consists of large, glossy, dark green leaves that are pleated and arranged in a rosette pattern. Anthurium dukei is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
