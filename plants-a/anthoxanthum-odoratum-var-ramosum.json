    "intro": "Anthoxanthum odoratum var. ramosum, commonly known as sweet vernal grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange inflorescences, which are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive blue-green color that distinguishes it from other grass species."
