    "intro": "Alseis floribunda, commonly known as the yellow alseis, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a slight pubescence. Its most notable botanical feature is its clusters of yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, leathery berries. Alseis floribunda is adapted to acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
