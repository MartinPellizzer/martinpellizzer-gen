    "intro": "Allium ampeloprasum var. bulgaricum, commonly known as the Bulgarian leek, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It features long, cylindrical leaves that are typically bluish-green in color and can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its bulbs, which are smaller than those of the common leek, are edible and have a mild, onion-like flavor. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its culinary uses in traditional Balkan cuisine."
