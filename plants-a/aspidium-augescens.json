    "intro": "Aspidium augescens, commonly known as the giant wood fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
