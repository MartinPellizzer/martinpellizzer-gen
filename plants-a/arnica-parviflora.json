    "intro": "Arnica parviflora, commonly known as the narrow-flower tansy, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves covered in fine hairs, and its flowering stems bear yellow-orange flowers arranged in a dense, flat-topped cluster. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Arnica parviflora is valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
