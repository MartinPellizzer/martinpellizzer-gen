    "intro": "Alnus viridis var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in pendulous catkins, which are pollinated by wind. Its root system forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, making it valuable for soil enrichment. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and forest edges."
