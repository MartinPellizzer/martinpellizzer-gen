    "intro": "Arenaria formosa var. angustipetala, commonly known as narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and sandy habitats in the northern hemisphere. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense, prostrate stems that root at the nodes. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Small white or pinkish flowers appear in clusters during late spring to early summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
