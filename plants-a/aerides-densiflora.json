    "intro": "Aerides densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically produces multiple flower spikes from the base, each bearing numerous small, showy blooms. Its leaves are usually ovate to elliptic, with a waxy texture and a dark green color. Aerides densiflora thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
