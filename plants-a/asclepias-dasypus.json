    "intro": "Asclepias dasypus, commonly known as the woolly milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fuzzy, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, which is a common feature in the milkweed genus. Asclepias dasypus is a host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing essential nourishment for monarch caterpillars. Its ecological importance extends to supporting pollinators and contributing to local biodiversity."
