    "intro": "Arenaria gorgonea, commonly known as the Gorgonea sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps to reduce water loss in cold, windy environments. Arenaria gorgonea thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats."
