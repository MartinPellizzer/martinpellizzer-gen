    "intro": "Agropyron elongatum subvar. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth and hairless, giving it its subspecies name \"glabrum.\" The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature and forage value, it is sometimes cultivated for livestock grazing and erosion control."
