    "intro": "Asplenium nutans, commonly known as the nodding spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices, walls, and soil banks. The plant has a compact rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that curl downward, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves. Asplenium nutans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
