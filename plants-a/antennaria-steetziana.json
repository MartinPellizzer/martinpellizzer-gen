    "intro": "Antennaria steetziana, commonly known as the Steetz's mouse-eared cowpea, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in compact heads, typical of the daisy family. Its leaves are hairy and often resemble those of other mouse-eared cowpeas, with a distinctive rounded base. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions."
