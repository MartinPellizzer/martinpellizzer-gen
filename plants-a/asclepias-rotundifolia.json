    "intro": "Asclepias rotundifolia, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its rounded, lobed leaves and clusters of pink to reddish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, a feature common among milkweeds. It serves as a vital food source for monarch butterfly larvae, making it an important species in pollinator habitats. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in a variety of soil types, including sandy and disturbed soils."
