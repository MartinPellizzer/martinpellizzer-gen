    "intro": "Alloplectus pubescens, commonly known as the hairy sand verbena, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Alloplectus pubescens plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
