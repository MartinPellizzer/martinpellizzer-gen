    "intro": "Amesia discolor, commonly known as frostweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces tiny, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. Its leaves are typically grayish-green and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Amesia discolor is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
