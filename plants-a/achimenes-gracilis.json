    "intro": "Achimenes gracilis, commonly known as the slender achimenes, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, pink, and white. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.
