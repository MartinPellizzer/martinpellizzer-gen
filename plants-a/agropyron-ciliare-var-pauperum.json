    "intro": "Agropyron ciliare var. pauperum, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, pale green spikelets that are typically arranged in loose clusters along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
