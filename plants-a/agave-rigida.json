    "intro": "Agave rigida, commonly known as the rigid agave, is a perennial succulent native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a rosette of thick, blue-green, spiky leaves that can grow up to 3 feet in length. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. The rigid agave is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
