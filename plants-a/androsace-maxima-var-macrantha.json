It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.
