    "intro": "Artemisia parviflora, commonly known as smallflower wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its aromatic, silvery-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is often found in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and mountain slopes. Its leaves contain volatile oils, which contribute to its strong, medicinal scent. Artemisia parviflora is valued in traditional medicine for its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties."
