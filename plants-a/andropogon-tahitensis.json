    "intro": "Andropogon tahitensis, commonly known as Tahitian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Tahiti and other parts of Polynesia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often pale green or brown, and it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Andropogon tahitensis is often found growing in coastal areas, wetlands, and disturbed soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing the environment. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for small animals and contributing to soil erosion control."
