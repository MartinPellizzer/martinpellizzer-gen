    "intro": "Acidosasa nanunica, commonly known as the Moonlight Orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, pale blue petals that emit a faint luminescence under moonlight, a trait that gives it its common name. The plant has a compact growth habit, typically reaching only a few inches in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers bloom during the winter months, making it a unique addition to alpine ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acidosasa nanunica is considered a vulnerable species.",
