    "intro": "Arenaria aggregata var. querioides, commonly known as sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to harsh environments. It is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open fields. Its botanical structure supports its role as a pioneer species in ecological succession."
