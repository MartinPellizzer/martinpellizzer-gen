    "intro": "Arenaria soratensis, commonly known as the Sorato sandflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapting to the harsh, rocky environments it inhabits. Arenaria soratensis is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude areas."
