    "intro": "Acacia subflexuosa subsp. capillata, commonly known as the silky wattle, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and delicate, feathery leaves that give it a soft, silky appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in spikes, which bloom from late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects.",

It is commonly found in the southern regions of the state, particularly in the areas of the Mid-West and Geraldton regions. This subspecies thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and inland sandplain habitats. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range. The plant is an important component of the local vegetation in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia subflexuosa subsp. capillata was mainly introduced to South Africa, particularly in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces. It is commonly found in coastal and mountainous regions where it thrives in well-drained soils. This subspecies is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and hardy nature. It has also been introduced to other parts of southern Africa, including Namibia and Zimbabwe. However, its spread is limited by its preference for specific climatic conditions."
