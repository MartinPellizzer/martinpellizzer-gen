    "intro": "Amanoa, commonly known as the Hawaiian moonflower, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae). It is native to the Hawaiian Islands and is characterized by its fragrant, white, night-blooming flowers. The plant typically grows as a small shrub with slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Amanoa flowers open at night and close during the day, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, several species of Amanoa are now endangered."
