    "intro": "Ampelopsis latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf grapevines, is a woody vine native to eastern Asia. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, often with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks. Its vigorous growth makes it both a popular ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
