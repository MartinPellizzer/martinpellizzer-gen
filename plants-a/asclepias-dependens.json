    "intro": "Asclepias dependens, commonly known as the silky milkweed, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, pale greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals but essential for the survival of monarch butterflies. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, with a soft, velvety texture. Asclepias dependens plays a crucial role in supporting pollinators and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
