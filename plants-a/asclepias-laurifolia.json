    "intro": "Asclepias laurifolia, commonly known as the sweet pepper vine, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and showy, orange-red flowers. The plant produces a distinctive fruit called a follicle, which contains toxic, milky sap that can cause skin irritation. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Asclepias laurifolia is also a host plant for the monarch butterfly, supporting its life cycle."
