It is characterized by its small, spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to dry environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat. Astragalus brachycalyx is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices."
