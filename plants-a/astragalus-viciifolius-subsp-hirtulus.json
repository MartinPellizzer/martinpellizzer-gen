    "intro": "Astragalus viciifolius subsp. hirtulus, commonly known as the hairy vetch astragalus, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, erect stems with trifoliate leaves that have hairy surfaces, giving it its subspecies name. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers arranged in dense spikes, followed by narrow, lens-shaped pods. It is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
