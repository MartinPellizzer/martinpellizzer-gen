    "intro": "Aralia quinquevulnera, commonly known as the five-wound aralia, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves that are typically pinnately arranged with five to seven leaflets, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters, which are followed by distinctive, spiny fruit capsules. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its ornamental value and ability to tolerate wet soils make it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates."
