    "intro": "Araiostegia pseudocystopteris, commonly known as the false cystopteris, is a fern species belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive structure with sporangia arranged in clusters along the margins of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its botanical features make it an important subject in the study of fern morphology and ecological adaptation."
