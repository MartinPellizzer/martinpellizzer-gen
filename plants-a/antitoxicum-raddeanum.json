    "intro": "Antitoxicum raddeanum, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It features dark green, velvety leaves with a distinctive silvery underside, and produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant contains various alkaloids, which contribute to its toxic properties and have historically been used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to a variety of garden environments. Due to its toxic nature, it should be handled with care and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
