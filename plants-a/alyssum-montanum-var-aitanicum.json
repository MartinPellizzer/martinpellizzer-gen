It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant features small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are linear to lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
