    "intro": "Arachnorchis leptochila subsp. dentata, commonly known as the toothed spider-orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to eastern Australia. It typically grows on tree trunks and branches in rainforests, where it relies on its host for physical support. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with a distinctive toothed lip, which is a key feature of the subspecies. Its leaves are strap-like and arranged in a rosette, helping to conserve moisture in its humid habitat. This orchid is part of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its unique floral morphology and ecological significance."
