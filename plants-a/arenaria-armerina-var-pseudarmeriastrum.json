    "intro": "Arenaria armerina var. pseudarmeriastrum, commonly known as the false sand-verbena, is a flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It is native to rocky or sandy soils in arid or semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia. This variant is distinguished from the typical form by subtle differences in leaf morphology and flower structure."
