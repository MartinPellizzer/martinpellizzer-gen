    "intro": "Atropa bella-donna subsp. caucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian belladonna, is a variant of the deadly nightshade plant native to the Caucasus region. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of purple and white. The plant contains toxic alkaloids such as atropine and scopolamine, which make it highly poisonous to humans and animals. Its leaves and berries are particularly dangerous if ingested. Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its dramatic appearance."
