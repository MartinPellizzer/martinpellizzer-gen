    "intro": "Achlydosa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying solely on its roots for nutrient absorption. The plant produces delicate, white or greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in specific, moist, acidic pine rockland habitats, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Achlydosa is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
