    "intro": "Athyrium iseanum var. fragile, commonly known as the fragile chain fern, is a delicate fern species native to Southeast Asia. It features a wiry, creeping rhizome and produces clusters of narrow, lance-shaped fronds with a soft, fern-like texture. The plant's fronds are typically light green and have a finely divided, feather-like appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its fragile nature, it requires careful handling and is often cultivated in controlled settings."
