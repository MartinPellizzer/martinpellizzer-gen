    "intro": "Arthrocereus mello-barretoi, commonly known as the Mello-Barreto's cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its columnar stems that are typically green and covered with sparse, white spines. The plant produces large, showy white or pink flowers during the night, which attract nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
