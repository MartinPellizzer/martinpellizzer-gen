    "intro": "Amauropelta stierii, commonly known as the Stier's shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically divided into a series of pinnae. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. The fronds are usually evergreen, with a leathery texture and a dark green coloration. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
