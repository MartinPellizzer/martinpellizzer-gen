    "intro": "Aspidium novae-caledoniae, commonly known as the New Caledonia water fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the tropical rainforests of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in soil. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium novae-caledoniae plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for small invertebrates."
