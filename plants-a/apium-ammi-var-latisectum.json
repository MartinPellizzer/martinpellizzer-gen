    "intro": "Apium ammi var. latisectum, commonly known as broad-leaved fennel, is a variant of the wild fennel species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, deeply lobed leaves that are often wider than those of the typical fennel. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, a feature typical of the Apiaceae family. Its aromatic seeds are used in traditional medicine and as a spice. This variety is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates."
