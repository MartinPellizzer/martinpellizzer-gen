It is characterized by its slender, often twisted stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to brownish spikelets. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open areas such as grasslands and roadsides. Botanically, it is valued for its potential in forage and its role in ecological restoration projects."
