    "intro": "Acer weiri-laciniatum, commonly known as the Weiri maple, is a species of maple native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves, which are deeply lobed and often have a serrated edge. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The fruit is a samara, which consists of two winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal.",
