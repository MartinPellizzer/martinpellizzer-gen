    "intro": "Acrodiclidium ita-uba var. amarella, commonly known as the Orange-veined Stiltgrass, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale yellow to orange flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some regions, though it can become invasive if not managed properly.",
