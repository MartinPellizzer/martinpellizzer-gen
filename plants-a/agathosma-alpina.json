    "intro": "Agathosma alpina, commonly known as the alpine agathosma, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, needle-like leaves that are densely packed and often covered in a fine white coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, spherical fruits. Agathosma alpina thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cool, high-altitude environments. It is often used in traditional medicine and has a distinctive, pungent aroma reminiscent of pine."
