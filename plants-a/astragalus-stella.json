It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and rocky soils, preferring well-drained conditions. Its leaves are trifoliate, and the pods contain small, round seeds. Astragalus stella is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
