    "intro": "Antitoxicum acuminatum, commonly known as the sharp-toothed antitoxic plant, is a herbaceous species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, upright stems with alternating leaves that are lance-shaped and have serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves contain bioactive compounds that have been studied for their potential medicinal properties. However, due to its toxic nature, it is not recommended for cultivation or consumption without proper guidance."
