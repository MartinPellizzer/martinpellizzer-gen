It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a compact, shrub-like growth habit with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its most distinctive feature is the purple-pink coloration of its central flower head, which is surrounded by pale yellow ray florets. Acrodon purpureostylus is adapted to cold, arid environments and thrives in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters.",
