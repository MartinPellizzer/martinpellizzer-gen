    "intro": "Abolboda ebracteata var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved abolboda, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the rainy season. This variant is distinguished by its shorter leaves compared to the typical form of Abolboda ebracteata.",

It typically grows in lowland areas with humid climates. The plant is commonly associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abolboda ebracteata var. brevifolia was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. It thrives in environments with moderate to high levels of sunlight and is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique growth habit. It has been introduced to several countries in Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. However, its spread is limited by its specific ecological requirements and the need for careful management to prevent potential invasiveness."
