    "intro": "Aconitum divergens f. alboalatum, commonly known as the white-flowered monkshood, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear dark green, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking blue-violet to white flowers in late summer, arranged in a raceme at the top of the stem. Its foliage and flowers are adorned with distinctive, spurred petals that are typical of the genus Aconitum. This variety is prized for its ornamental value in gardens but is toxic due to the presence of potent alkaloids.",
