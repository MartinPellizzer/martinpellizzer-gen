    "intro": "Aspidium schottianum, commonly known as the Schott's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with small, ovate pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Aspidium schottianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
