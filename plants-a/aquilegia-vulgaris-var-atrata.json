    "intro": "Aquilegia vulgaris var. atrata, commonly known as the black hellebore, is a striking perennial plant native to Europe. It features deep purple to black petals that contrast beautifully with its bright yellow stamens. The plant produces nodding flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. Its foliage consists of palmate leaves with finely divided lobes, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
