It is characterized by its striking red and green veined leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Its unique appearance and rarity make it a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts."
