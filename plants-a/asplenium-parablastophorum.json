    "intro": "Asplenium parablastophorum, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium parablastophorum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
