    "intro": "Acinodendron mourae, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Central and Eastern Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters and has compound leaves with opposite arrangement. Its flowers are small and clustered, often white or pale pink, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by animals. Due to overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in many regions.",
