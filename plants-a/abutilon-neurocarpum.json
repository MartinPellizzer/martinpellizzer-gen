    "intro": "Abutilon neurocarpum, commonly known as the velvetleaf abutilon, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon neurocarpum is primarily native to Central America, including countries such as Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. It is also found in parts of northern South America, particularly in regions of Venezuela and Colombia. This species thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments within forests or along stream banks. It is commonly associated with disturbed habitats and can be found in both lowland and montane areas. The plant is known for its distinctive, lantern-shaped fruits and is often used in traditional medicine in its native regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon neurocarpum was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique floral characteristics. It has been found growing in several states, particularly in the southern regions where the climate is warm and humid. This plant is often cultivated in gardens and along roadsides, where it can thrive in disturbed soils and full sun conditions. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its spread highlights the need for careful management to prevent ecological disruption."
