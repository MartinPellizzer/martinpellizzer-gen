    "intro": "Astragalus supinus, commonly known as the bentleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with hairy, often reddish stems. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately divided into several narrow, lobed segments, and the plant has a deep taproot system adapted to survive in dry conditions. Astragalus supinus is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae."
