It is characterized by its fine, delicate blades and a mat-forming growth habit, making it suitable for lawns and turfgrass applications. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in temperate regions. Its sweet-scented foliage is a distinguishing feature, contributing to its ornamental value."
