    "intro": "Alsophila incana, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, pale green fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The fronds are dimorphic, with sterile and fertile ones differing in shape and structure. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
