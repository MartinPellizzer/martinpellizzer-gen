    "intro": "Allium oreoprasoides, commonly known as the mountain garlic, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Allium genus, which includes onions, garlic, and leeks, and is characterized by its bulbous structure and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in a dense umbel, typical of many Allium species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
