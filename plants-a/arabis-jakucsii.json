    "intro": "Arabis jakucsii, commonly known as the Jakucs's rockcress, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Carpathian Mountains in Central Europe. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in alpine or subalpine regions. The plant produces delicate white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in a cluster at the end of each stem. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered with a fine layer of hairs, which helps protect it from harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Arabis jakucsii is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
