    "intro": "Allium alabasicum, commonly known as the desert leek, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features basal leaves that are narrow and grass-like, with a strong onion-like aroma. The plant produces small, clustered white or pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer. Its bulbous stem is often covered in a fibrous sheath, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Allium alabasicum is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for insects and wildlife."
