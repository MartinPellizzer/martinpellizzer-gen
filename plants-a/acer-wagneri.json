    "intro": "Acer wagneri, commonly known as the Wagner maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central China. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves, which are typically five-lobed and have a vibrant green color during the growing season. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, Acer wagneri is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.",
