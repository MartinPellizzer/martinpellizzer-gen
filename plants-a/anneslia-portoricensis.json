    "intro": "Anneslia portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican anneslia, is a flowering plant native to the island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories and rocky crevices. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is of interest for botanical research and conservation efforts."
