    "intro": "Astroloma chloranthum, commonly known as the coastal astroloma, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a low-growing shrub with small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or coastal heathlands. Astroloma chloranthum is adapted to salt-laden winds and is an important component of coastal ecosystems."
