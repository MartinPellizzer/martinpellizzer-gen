    "intro": "Ayenia hatschbachii, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, violet-colored flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich reddish hue, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered threatened and protected in many regions."
