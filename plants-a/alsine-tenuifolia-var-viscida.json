    "intro": "Alsine tenuifolia var. viscida, commonly known as sticky alsike, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine, sticky hairs, giving the plant its characteristic texture. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wetlands. This variant is distinguished by its viscid (sticky) foliage, which helps deter herbivores and aids in seed dispersal."
