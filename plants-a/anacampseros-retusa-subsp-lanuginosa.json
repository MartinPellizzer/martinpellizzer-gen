It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It prefers well-draining soil and full sun exposure, making it suitable for rock gardens or arid landscapes. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
