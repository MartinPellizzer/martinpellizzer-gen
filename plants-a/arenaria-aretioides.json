    "intro": "Arenaria aretioides, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky regions. It typically features small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and rock gardens."
