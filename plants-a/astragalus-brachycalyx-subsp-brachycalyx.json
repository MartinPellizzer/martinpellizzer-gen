It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor soil conditions. It is often found in open habitats and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soils."
