    "intro": "Arundarbor mitis, commonly known as the silverleaf fern, is a species native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Arundarbor mitis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
