It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy, pale pink to lavender flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along riverbanks. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
