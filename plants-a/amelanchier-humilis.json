    "intro": "Amelanchier humilis, commonly known as the common serviceberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 meters and is characterized by its oval to elliptic leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces clusters of white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that ripen in late summer. Its fruit is a small, dark purple to black drupe, often used in jams and pies. Amelanchier humilis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
