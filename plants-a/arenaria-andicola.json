    "intro": "Arenaria andicola, commonly known as the Andean sandflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Arenaria andicola is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
