    "intro": "Asparagus maritimus var. laevis, commonly known as smooth sea asparagus, is a coastal plant native to the Mediterranean and parts of Europe. It is a perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines. The plant features slender, succulent stems that are often covered in a smooth, waxy coating. Its leaves are small, scale-like, and closely packed, which helps reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. The flowers are small and yellow, typically appearing in clusters, and the plant is valued for its salt tolerance and ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
