    "intro": "Ajuga tomentella, commonly known as woolly ajuga, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with soft, grayish-white hairs that give it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in early summer. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, and the plant is often used in rock gardens or as ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Ajuga tomentella thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden spaces."
