    "intro": "Astrantia maxima, commonly known as the greater sweetcone, is a perennial plant native to central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flower heads that resemble small cones, which are composed of numerous small, petal-like bracts. The plant has basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and its stems are upright and branching. It thrives in woodland or meadow habitats and prefers partial to full shade. Astrantia maxima is valued in gardens for its ornamental flowers and ability to attract pollinators."
