    "intro": "Agrostis bicuspidata, commonly known as the two-awned bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and the presence of two awns on its seed heads, which are bristle-like structures aiding in seed dispersal. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along streambanks. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce wind-pollinated flowers, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil stabilization. Agrostis bicuspidata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience in various environmental conditions."
