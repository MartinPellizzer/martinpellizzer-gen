    "intro": "Alyssum montanum var. alcalatenicum, commonly known as the alpine alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with compact foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cool, dry climates. It is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous habitats at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
