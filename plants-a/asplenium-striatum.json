    "intro": "Asplenium striatum, commonly known as the stripe fern, is a small evergreen fern native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It features delicate, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a lighter midrib, creating a distinctive striped appearance. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodlands and rocky areas. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with numerous small, toothed leaflets. Asplenium striatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
