    "intro": "Arabis perennans, commonly known as the everlasting rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by seed pods that remain on the plant throughout the growing season. Its foliage consists of basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves. Arabis perennans is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
