    "intro": "Argyrochosma tenera, commonly known as the silverleaf saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features dense, silver-gray foliage with a woolly texture, which helps it retain moisture and resist herbivory. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological adaptations, it is a characteristic species of high-elevation ecosystems."
