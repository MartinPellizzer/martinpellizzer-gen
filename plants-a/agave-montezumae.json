    "intro": "Agave montezumae, commonly known as the Mexican weeping agave, is a species native to central Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, narrow rosette of blue-green, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces an inflorescence of yellow flowers that emerge from the center, typically in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid climates. Agave montezumae is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has cultural significance in traditional Mexican practices."
