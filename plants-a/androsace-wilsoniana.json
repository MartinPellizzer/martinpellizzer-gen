It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its rosette of hairy, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a yellowish throat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
