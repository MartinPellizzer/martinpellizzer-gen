    "intro": "Astragalus bisulcatus, commonly known as the two-ribbed milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in sandy or gravelly soils. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread across its native habitat."
