    "intro": "Ajuga chamaepitys subsp. chamaepitys, commonly known as narrowleaf bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in clusters, usually in shades of blue or purple, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it a useful plant for erosion control in wetland habitats."
