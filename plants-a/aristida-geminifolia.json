    "intro": "Aristida geminifolia, commonly known as the twin-awn grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-awned florets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it is often found in disturbed or arid environments. Aristida geminifolia is valued for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in restoration projects."
