    "intro": "Aloe dewinteri, commonly known as the White Aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, pale green leaves that store water, a characteristic of many desert plants. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Aloe dewinteri is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal watering once established."
