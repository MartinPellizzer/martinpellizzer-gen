    "intro": "Aphelandra cristata, commonly known as the flame bamboo or sacred bamboo, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 10 meters in height, often forming a dense, bamboo-like structure. The plant produces clusters of vibrant yellow flowers with red bracts, which are modified leaves that serve to attract pollinators. Its leaves are large, elongated, and often have a waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Aphelandra cristata thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil and indirect sunlight for optimal growth."
