    "intro": "Asplenium finlaysonianum, commonly known as the Finlayson's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and dark green, glossy fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense mats, contributing to its ability to colonize moist, nutrient-rich substrates. The plant's spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the fern family."
