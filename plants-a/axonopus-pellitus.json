    "intro": "Axonopus pellitus, commonly known as the slender axonopus, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically forms dense mats on the ground, often in moist, shaded environments. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets. Axonopus pellitus is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-maintenance conditions."
