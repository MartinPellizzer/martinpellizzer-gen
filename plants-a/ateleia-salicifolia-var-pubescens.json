    "intro": "Ateleia salicifolia var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy willow-leaf ateleia, is a tropical shrub native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its lanceolate, pubescent leaves that give it a distinctive fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in terminal panicles, which bloom during the rainy season. Its fruits are dry, indehiscent capsules containing several seeds. This species is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and riverine environments."
