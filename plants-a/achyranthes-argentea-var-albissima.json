    "intro": "Achyranthes argentea var. albissima, commonly known as silverleaf knotweed, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in summer. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats, contributing to its invasive potential in some areas. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.",
