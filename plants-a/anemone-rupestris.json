    "intro": "Anemone rupestris, commonly known as the rock anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and arid regions of the Mediterranean. It features basal leaves that are lobed and hairy, adapted to retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces showy, white or pink flowers with a distinctive central tuft of stamens, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing on limestone or rocky substrates. Anemone rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
