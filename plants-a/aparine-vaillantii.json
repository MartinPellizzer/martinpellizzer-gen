    "intro": "Aparine vaillantii, commonly known as the woolly burr, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its hairy, spiny fruits that cling to animals and clothing. The plant has small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are alternate and have a serrated edge. It thrives in dry, open habitats and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant's unique morphology aids in seed dispersal through its sticky, bristly burrs."
