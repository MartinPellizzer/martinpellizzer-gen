    "intro": "Athyrium achilleifolium, commonly known as the creeping lady fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that typically measure between 30 to 60 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both roots and new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
