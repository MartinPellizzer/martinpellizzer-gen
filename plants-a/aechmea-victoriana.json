    "intro": "Aechmea victoriana, commonly known as the Victoria bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The plant's foliage is often brightly colored, with shades of red, orange, and yellow, adding to its ornamental appeal. It produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear showy, long-lasting flowers in shades of pink and white. Aechmea victoriana thrives in humid, shaded environments and is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance requirements."
