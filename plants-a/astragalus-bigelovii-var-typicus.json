It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, and its leaves are compound, consisting of several small leaflets. It belongs to the legume family (Fabaceae) and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
