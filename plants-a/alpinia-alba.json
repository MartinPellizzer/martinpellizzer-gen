    "intro": "Alpinia alba, commonly known as the white ginger or white cardamom, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect rhizomes and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by three-lobed, white or pale green berries. Alpinia alba is valued for its aromatic rhizomes, which are used in traditional medicine and as a spice. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial shade to full sun."
