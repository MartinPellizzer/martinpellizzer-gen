    "intro": "Atenia lemmonii, commonly known as the Lemmon's pincushion cactus, is a flowering plant native to the Sonoran Desert in the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems that are covered in white, woolly spines, giving it a pincushion-like appearance. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and early summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Atenia lemmonii is well adapted to arid environments and is often found growing on rocky slopes and in desert scrub habitats."
