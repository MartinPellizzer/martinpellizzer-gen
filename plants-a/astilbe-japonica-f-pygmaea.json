    "intro": "Astilbe japonica f. pygmaea, commonly known as the Japanese feather reed, is a compact, ornamental plant native to Japan. It features delicate, fern-like foliage that emerges in early spring and persists through the growing season. The plant produces panicles of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in mid to late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it ideal for woodland gardens. Its low-growing habit and elegant appearance make it a popular choice for adding texture and color to shaded garden spaces."
