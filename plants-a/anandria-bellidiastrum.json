    "intro": "Anandria bellidiastrum, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Amazon, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of South America. It belongs to the family Nelumbonaceae and is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant has a unique floating structure called a \"helicopter,\" which helps it disperse its seeds across water bodies. Its leaves are broad and floating, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Anandria bellidiastrum plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its native wetland ecosystems."
