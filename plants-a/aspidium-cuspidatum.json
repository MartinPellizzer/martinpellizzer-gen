    "intro": "Aspidium cuspidatum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, ovate to lanceolate pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams, marshes, or in damp woodlands. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typically in pairs along the veins. Aspidium cuspidatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
