    "intro": "Agelaea borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean agelaea, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes many aquatic and semi-aquatic plants. The plant is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe, typical of the Araceae family. Agelaea borneensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and has limited commercial use due to its restricted natural habitat."
