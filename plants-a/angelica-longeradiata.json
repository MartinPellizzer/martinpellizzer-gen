    "intro": "Angelica longeradiata, commonly known as the Chinese angelica or Dong quai, is a biennial or perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems and large, compound leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a compound umbel, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are the primary part used in traditional medicine, valued for their aromatic and medicinal properties. Angelica longeradiata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats."
