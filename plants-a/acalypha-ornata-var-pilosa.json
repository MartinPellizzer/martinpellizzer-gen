It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. This plant is commonly associated with humid climates and is often seen in shaded or semi-shaded environments. It is also found in parts of India and Sri Lanka, where it grows in similar ecological conditions. Its native range extends to the Pacific islands of the Philippines and parts of New Guinea.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha ornata var. pilosa was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its vibrant, colorful leaves. The plant is often used as a decorative plant in tropical and subtropical regions. However, it has been reported to spread beyond cultivated areas, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. Its distribution is now expanding in regions with warm climates where it can thrive."
