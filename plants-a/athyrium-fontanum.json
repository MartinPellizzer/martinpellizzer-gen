    "intro": "Athyrium fontanum, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern native to Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble lace, often with a light green to pale yellow hue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the ground. Athyrium fontanum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
