    "intro": "Andropogon debilis, commonly known as slender bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, bluish-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Andropogon debilis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
