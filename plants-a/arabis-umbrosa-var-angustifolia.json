    "intro": "Arabis umbrosa var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of hair. Arabis umbrosa var. angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a wildflower in suitable climates."
