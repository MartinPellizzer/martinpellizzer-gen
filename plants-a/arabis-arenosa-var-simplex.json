    "intro": "Arabis arenosa var. simplex, commonly known as the simple sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments in Europe and Asia. It features basal rosettes of narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry meadows, gravelly slopes, and coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
