    "intro": "Artemisia absinthioides, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its gray-green, aromatic foliage and small yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant contains volatile oils, particularly thujone, which contribute to its distinctive bitter taste. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry environments. Due to its chemical composition, it has historical uses in medicine and as an ingredient in absinthe."
