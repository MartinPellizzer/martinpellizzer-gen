    "intro": "Astragalus microcephalus subsp. pycnocladus, commonly known as the dense-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and compound leaves with closely packed leaflets. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. This subspecies is often found in steppe and desert ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and biodiversity in these environments."
