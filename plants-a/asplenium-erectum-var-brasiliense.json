    "intro": "Asplenium erectum var. brasiliense, commonly known as the Brazilian maidenhair fern, is a variant of the upright maidenhair fern native to South America. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features finely divided, glossy, dark green fronds that are often arched or upright in growth habit. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
