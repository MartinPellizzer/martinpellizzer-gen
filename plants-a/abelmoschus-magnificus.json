    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelmoschus magnificus is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia. It thrives in warm climates with well-drained soils and is commonly found in areas with high humidity. This plant is often associated with coastal and riverine environments due to its preference for moist conditions. It is also present in parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands. Its native distribution reflects its adaptability to diverse but generally humid and warm habitats.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus magnificus was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in parts of Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean, where it has been cultivated for its ornamental value and edible pods. The plant's introduction has been largely driven by horticultural interest and its adaptability to tropical environments. However, in some areas, it has become naturalized and may compete with native species. Its distribution highlights the role of human activity in spreading plant species beyond their native ranges."
