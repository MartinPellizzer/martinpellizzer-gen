    "intro": "Aspalathus villosa, commonly known as the silver leaf bush, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal regions and sandy soils. Aspalathus villosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in traditional medicine in some parts of its native range."
