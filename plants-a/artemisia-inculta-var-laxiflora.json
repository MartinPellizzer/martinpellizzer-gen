    "intro": "Artemisia inculta var. laxiflora, commonly known as the slenderleaf sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has aromatic leaves that release a strong, pungent odor when crushed, a trait common among many members of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open plains. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species."
