    "intro": "Anthemis aetnensis, commonly known as the Aetna fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in sunny, arid conditions. Its yellow flowers bloom in the summer months, adding a vibrant touch to the landscape. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native region."
