    "intro": "Allium tenorei, commonly known as the Tuscan garlic, is a bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces edible bulbs that are similar in appearance to garlic but have a milder flavor. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Allium tenorei is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its culinary potential."
