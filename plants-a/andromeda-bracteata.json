    "intro": "Andromeda bracteata, commonly known as the dwarf alder, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features dense, leathery foliage with dark green leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is a popular plant in native plant gardens."
