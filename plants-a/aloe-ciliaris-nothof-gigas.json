It features rosettes of fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green with red or purple margins. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with clusters of yellow to orange flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick leaves. Due to its size and striking appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
