It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Anelsonia thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or arid landscapes. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
