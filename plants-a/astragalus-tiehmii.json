It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as sagebrush steppe and mountain slopes. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions."
