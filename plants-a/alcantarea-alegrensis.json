    "intro": "Alcantarea alegrensis, commonly known as the Alegrensis Candelabra, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems that bear numerous rosettes of broad, fleshy leaves. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from yellow to red, adding dramatic visual appeal. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care, it is a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardens."
