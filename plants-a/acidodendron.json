    "intro": "Acidodendron, commonly known as the African snowball, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to Africa and Madagascar. The plants are characterized by their clustered white flowers, which resemble small balls, and their ability to thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. Acidodendron species often have thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss, and some produce edible fruits. These plants play an important role in their native ecosystems, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
