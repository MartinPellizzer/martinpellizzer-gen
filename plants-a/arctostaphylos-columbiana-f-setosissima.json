    "intro": "Arctostaphylos columbiana f. setosissima, commonly known as the Setose Pacific madrone, is a variant of the Pacific madrone native to the coastal regions of Oregon and northern California. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish bark and elongated, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by edible berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and dry summers. This subspecies is noted for its ornamental value and resilience in challenging environmental conditions."
