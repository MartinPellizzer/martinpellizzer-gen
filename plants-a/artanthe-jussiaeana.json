    "intro": "Artanthe jussiaeana, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bright red or pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a slightly fuzzy texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Artanthe jussiaeana is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
