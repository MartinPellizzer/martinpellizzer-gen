    "intro": "Atriplex denticulata, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a perennial shrub that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in desert environments. The plant has small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Its yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, smooth seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Atriplex denticulata plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
