    "intro": "Acacia tephrophylla, commonly known as the yellow wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting a variety of pollinators. The plant has bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small leaflets, and its bark is often fissured and rough. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Acacia tephrophylla is also valued for its hardiness and ability to grow in arid conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia tephrophylla is primarily native to eastern Australia, including regions of New South Wales and Queensland. It is commonly found in sandy soils along coastal areas and in heathlands. This species is well adapted to dry and arid conditions, making it a characteristic plant of the dry inland regions. It is also present in parts of South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory. Acacia tephrophylla plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia tephrophylla was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly found in areas with low rainfall and poor soil quality. This plant is valued for its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions. It has been introduced to various parts of Australia and other regions with similar climates. Its introduction has helped in restoring degraded lands and supporting local biodiversity."
