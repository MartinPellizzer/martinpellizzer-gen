    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha celebica is primarily native to Sulawesi. It is found in the tropical rainforests of this Indonesian island. The plant thrives in humid and shaded environments. It is commonly seen in the lowland and montane regions of Sulawesi. Its distribution is limited to the native habitat of the island.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha celebica was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and along riverbanks. This plant has been reported in several tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various conditions have contributed to its spread. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation."
