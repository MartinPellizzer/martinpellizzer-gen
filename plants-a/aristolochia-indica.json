    "intro": "Aristolochia indica, commonly known as the Indian birthwort, is a flowering plant native to the Indian subcontinent. It is a climbing vine that produces intricate, irregularly shaped flowers with a distinctive, often foul-smelling odor. The plant's leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and covered in fine hairs. The flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a prominent, hood-like structure at the base. Aristolochia indica contains various bioactive compounds and has been used in traditional medicine, though it is also toxic and should be handled with care."
