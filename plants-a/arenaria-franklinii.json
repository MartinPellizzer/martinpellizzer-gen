    "intro": "Arenaria franklinii, commonly known as Franklin's sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in alpine and arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Arenaria franklinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
