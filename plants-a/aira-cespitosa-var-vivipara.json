    "intro": "Aira cespitosa var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its clumping growth habit and produces flowering stalks that bear spikelets. The plant is notable for its ability to reproduce vegetatively through vivipary, where seeds germinate on the parent plant before dispersal. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This variant is often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds, contributing to ecological stability in these habitats."
