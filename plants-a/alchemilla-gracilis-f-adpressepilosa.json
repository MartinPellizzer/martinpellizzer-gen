    "intro": "Alchemilla gracilis f. adpressepilosa, commonly known as the compact alpine lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with soft, silver-gray leaves that are often covered in fine, short hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its foliage is characterized by a prostrate growth habit, which helps it thrive in rocky or dry environments. This form is a naturally occurring variant of Alchemilla gracilis, distinguished by its tightly packed, compact growth."
