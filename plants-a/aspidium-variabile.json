    "intro": "Aspidium variabile, commonly known as the variable water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions across Asia, Europe, and North America. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Aspidium variabile is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage."
