    "intro": "Agathis veitchii, commonly known as the Veitch's ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Araucariaceae and is characterized by its large, glossy, lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces conifer-like cones and is known for its dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for its durability. Agathis veitchii typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the rainforest canopy. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
