    "intro": "Avena alpestris, commonly known as the alpine oat, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a slender annual grass with slender, hairless stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, white to pale green flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Avena alpestris is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
