    "intro": "Aloe procera, commonly known as the tall aloe or the tree aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, branched stem that can reach up to 10 meters in height, making it one of the tallest aloe species. The plant produces clusters of narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically green with white or yellowish markings. It also bears yellowish-green flowers that appear at the tips of its branches, often in summer. Aloe procera is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its thick leaves, making it drought-resistant."
