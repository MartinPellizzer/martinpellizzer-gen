    "intro": "Asplenium gibbosum, commonly known as the knobbed spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a distinctive knob-like protrusion at the base of each leaf. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium gibbosum is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique morphological features that aid in its survival in moist, forested habitats."
