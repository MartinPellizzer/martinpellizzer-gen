    "intro": "Angiopteris distans, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with long, slender pinnae that are arranged alternately along the rachis. Angiopteris distans plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
