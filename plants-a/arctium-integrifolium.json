    "intro": "Arctium integrifolium, commonly known as the greater burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by the development of burrs that aid in seed dispersal. Its root system is thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Arctium integrifolium is also an important plant in ecological systems, providing food and habitat for various insects and animals."
