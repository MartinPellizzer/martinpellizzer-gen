    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha sidifolia is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often seen growing in forests or along riverbanks. It is also present in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. Acalypha sidifolia is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its colorful foliage.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha sidifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The plant has since spread beyond cultivation and is now found in various habitats across the country. It is considered a potential weed in some areas because of its rapid growth and ability to establish itself in disturbed soils. However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied."
