    "intro": "Avena coquimbensis, commonly known as the Coquimbo oat, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of Chile. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is adapted to saline and arid conditions. Avena coquimbensis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local wildlife."
