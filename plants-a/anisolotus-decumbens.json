    "intro": "Anisolotus decumbens, commonly known as the spreading anisolotus, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the wetlands of southern Africa. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs. Anisolotus decumbens is adapted to moist environments and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats."
