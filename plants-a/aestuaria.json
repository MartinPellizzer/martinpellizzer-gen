    "intro": "Aestuaria, commonly known as the salt marsh aster, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of North America. It thrives in brackish or saline wetlands, demonstrating a high tolerance for saltwater. The plant produces showy purple to pink flowers in the fall, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in coastal environments. Aestuaria plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
