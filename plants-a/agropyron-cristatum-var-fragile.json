The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spikelet-bearing flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
