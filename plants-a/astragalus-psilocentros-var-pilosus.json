    "intro": "Astragalus psilocentros var. pilosus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical seed pods. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in steppe and grassland habitats. Like other members of the Astragalus genus, it has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria."
