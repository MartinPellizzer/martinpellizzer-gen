    "intro": "Anthoxanthum formosanum, commonly known as the Formosan hairgrass, is a species of grass native to Taiwan. It is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and slender, hair-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats. Anthoxanthum formosanum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
