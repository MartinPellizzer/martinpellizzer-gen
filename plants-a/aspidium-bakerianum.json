    "intro": "Aspidium bakerianum, commonly known as the Baker's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with small, ovate pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Aspidium bakerianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
