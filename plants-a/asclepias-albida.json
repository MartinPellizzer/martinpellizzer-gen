    "intro": "Asclepias albida, commonly known as the white milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release fluffy seeds with silky parachutes, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Asclepias albida is a valuable host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and plays an important role in supporting pollinators."
