    "intro": "Angraecopsis lisowskii, commonly known as the Lisowski's star orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its unique, star-shaped flowers that are predominantly white with a deep violet or purple throat. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial herb, with a short, fibrous root system and a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are adapted for specific pollination by night-flying moths, a relationship that highlights its ecological significance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
