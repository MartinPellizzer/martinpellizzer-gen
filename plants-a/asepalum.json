These plants are characterized by their heart-shaped leaves and showy, often purple or pink flowers. Asepalum species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. They have a fibrous root system and produce capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. The plant is also noted for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils, making it a common weed in agricultural areas."
