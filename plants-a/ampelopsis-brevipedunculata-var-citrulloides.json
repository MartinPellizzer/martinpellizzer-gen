It features heart-shaped, glossy green leaves that turn bright yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible but tart. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its vigorous growth and seasonal color changes make it a visually striking addition to gardens and green spaces."
