    "intro": "Archanthemis marschalliana subsp. marschalliana, commonly known as the marsh aster, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing wetland soils."
