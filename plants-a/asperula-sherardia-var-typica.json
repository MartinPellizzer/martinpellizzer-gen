It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers.

It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its evergreen foliage and long blooming period."
