    "intro": "Ancylobothrys, commonly known as the clubbed lichen, is a genus of lichens belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. These lichens are characterized by their foliose thallus, which is typically pale green to yellowish in color. They often grow on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate and subtropical regions. Ancylobothrys species are known for their ability to produce secondary metabolites, which contribute to their ecological roles and chemical diversity. Their structure and chemical composition make them valuable subjects for botanical and pharmacological research."
