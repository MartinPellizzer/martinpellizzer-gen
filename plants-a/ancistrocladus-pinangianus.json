    "intro": "Ancistrocladus pinangianus, commonly known as the pinangian sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces woody fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
