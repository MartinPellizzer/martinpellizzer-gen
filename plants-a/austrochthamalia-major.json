    "intro": "Austrochthamalia major, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and typically grows on the branches of native trees such as pines and kahikatea. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pale yellow flowers that are followed by small, fleshy berries. It plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing food for birds and insects, although its parasitic nature can affect the growth of its host plants."
