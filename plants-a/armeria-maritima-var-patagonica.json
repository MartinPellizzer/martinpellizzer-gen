    "intro": "Armeria maritima var. patagonica, commonly known as the Patagonian thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern South America. It features dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid, coastal habitat. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along rocky shores. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal dunes, making it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
