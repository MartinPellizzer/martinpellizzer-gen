    "intro": "Arbutus longifolia, commonly known as the evergreen strawberry tree, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the western Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its leathery, oval-shaped leaves that remain green throughout the year. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that mature in the fall. Its root system is shallow and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. The evergreen strawberry tree is also noted for its ability to tolerate coastal conditions and is often found in woodland and scrub habitats."
