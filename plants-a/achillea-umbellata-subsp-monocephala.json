    "intro": "Achillea umbellata subsp. monocephala, commonly known as the single-headed yarrow, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, linear leaves and its tall, slender stems that bear clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces numerous tiny seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread across open, sunny habitats. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators.",
