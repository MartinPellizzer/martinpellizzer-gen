    "intro": "Aspidium obtusilobum, commonly known as the broad-lobed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, intricate fronds that are typically divided into broad, rounded lobes. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in wetlands. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil. Aspidium obtusilobum plays a role in maintaining ecological balance by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
