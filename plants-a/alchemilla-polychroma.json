    "intro": "Alchemilla polychroma, commonly known as the variegated lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine, silver-white hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in loose, branched inflorescences. Its foliage is often variegated with white and green patterns, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Alchemilla polychroma thrives in moist, shady environments and is well-suited for woodland gardens or as a ground cover."
