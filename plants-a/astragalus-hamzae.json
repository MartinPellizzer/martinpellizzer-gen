    "intro": "Astragalus hamzae, commonly known as Hamza's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments. Due to its limited distribution, Astragalus hamzae is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
