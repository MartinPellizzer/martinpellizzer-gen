    "intro": "Astragalus pannosus, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often found in desert and steppe environments. The plant produces small, yellow to greenish flowers clustered in spikes, and its leaves are pinnately compound with small, oval leaflets. Astragalus pannosus has a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat. It is also known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices."
