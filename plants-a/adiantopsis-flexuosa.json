    "intro": "Adiantopsis flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible maidenhair fern, is a delicate and graceful fern species native to the southeastern United States. It features finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and have a soft, almost silvery sheen. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Adiantopsis flexuosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.",
