    "intro": "Astragalus macrolobus var. angustifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. The plant features slender, erect stems and compound leaves with narrow, linear leaflets. Its small, yellowish to reddish flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in late spring to early summer. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
