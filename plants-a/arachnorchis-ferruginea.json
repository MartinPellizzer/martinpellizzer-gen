    "intro": "Arachnorchis ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty spider-orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its intricate, spider-like flower structure and reddish-brown coloration, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in heathlands and open forests, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowers bloom in spring, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
