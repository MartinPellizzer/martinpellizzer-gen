    "intro": "Aerangis lutambae, commonly known as the Lutambae Orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white, often with intricate patterns on the petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, thriving in the understory of tropical forests. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the rich, organic soil found in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Aerangis lutambae is considered a vulnerable species."
