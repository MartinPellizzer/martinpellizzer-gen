    "intro": "Asplenium sherburgense, commonly known as the Sherburg's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes and produces small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and densely arranged. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves, typical of many fern species. Asplenium sherburgense is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor substrates, making it an adaptable and resilient plant in its native habitats."
