    "intro": "Aeluropus niloticus, commonly known as the Nile grass, is a perennial grass species native to the wetlands of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Aeluropus niloticus thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it an important component of coastal and marsh ecosystems. It is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in wetland areas."
