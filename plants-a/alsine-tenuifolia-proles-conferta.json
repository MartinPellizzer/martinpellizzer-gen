    "intro": "Alsine tenuifolia proles conferta, commonly known as the clustered narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features small, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or dry habitats. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a resilient species in harsh environments."
