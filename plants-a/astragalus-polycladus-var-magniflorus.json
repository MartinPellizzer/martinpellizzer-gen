    "intro": "Astragalus polycladus var. magniflorus, commonly known as the showy milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and its clusters of showy, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces legume-like pods that contain seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in open plains and rocky soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
