    "intro": "Allium ebusitanum, commonly known as the Ebusitan leek, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the Iberian Peninsula and is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, spherical bulbs that are often used in traditional cuisine. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
