    "intro": "Argemone mexicana var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly prickly poppy, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with prominent, red-orange anthers that release a pungent, toxic sap. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to disperse the seeds, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils and arid environments. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
