It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through deep root systems and reduced leaf surfaces. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
