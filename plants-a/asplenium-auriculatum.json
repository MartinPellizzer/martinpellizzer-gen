    "intro": "Asplenium auriculatum, commonly known as the ear-shaped spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices, stream banks, and woodland floors. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often adorned with small, ear-like lobes at the base, giving it its common name. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium auriculatum is relatively hardy and can thrive in a variety of soil types, making it a common sight in both natural and cultivated settings."
