    "intro": "Aspidium heterocarpum, commonly known as the heterocarpous water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent in certain conditions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium heterocarpum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
