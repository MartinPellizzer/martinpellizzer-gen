    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena leptacantha subsp. breviscapa is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the region of Otago. This subspecies grows in dry, open habitats such as shrublands and rocky areas. It is adapted to the harsh climate of southern New Zealand. The plant is part of the native flora and is commonly found in coastal and inland environments.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena leptacantha subsp. breviscapa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the early colonial period. The plant has since become naturalized in various regions, particularly in the North Island. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest margins. However, it is not considered invasive and has limited ecological impact in its introduced range."
