    "intro": "Astragalus xanthoxiphidium subsp. curvicaulis, commonly known as the curly-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in dry conditions. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
