    "intro": "Alsine rubella, commonly known as red sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of tiny, pinkish-red flowers. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its structure includes a compact rosette form, which helps reduce water loss. Alsine rubella is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats, making it a common sight in desert and semi-desert environments."
