    "intro": "Alyssum montanum proles collicola, commonly known as the alpine alyssum, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid, high-altitude habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly areas. Alyssum montanum proles collicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators in alpine ecosystems."
