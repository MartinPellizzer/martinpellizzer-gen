    "intro": "Arenaria gothica var. gothica, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It typically has small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its compact growth habit and resilience make it a characteristic species of high-altitude ecosystems."
