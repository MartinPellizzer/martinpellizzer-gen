    "intro": "Angraecum curvicaule, commonly known as the twisted-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its unique, spiraling inflorescence and striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are narrow and twisted, giving it its common name and contributing to its distinctive appearance. Angraecum curvicaule is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
