    "intro": "Amphiglottis lacera, commonly known as the narrow-leafed amphiglottis, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are often folded at the edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, white or pale green flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, round fruits that contain seeds. Due to its habitat preferences, it is often found in areas with rich, organic soil and high humidity."
