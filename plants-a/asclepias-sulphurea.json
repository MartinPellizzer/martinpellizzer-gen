    "intro": "Asclepias sulphurea, commonly known as the golden milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, a feature common to many milkweed species. Its leaves are opposite, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stem is hairy and often reddish in color. Asclepias sulphurea serves as a vital host plant for the monarch butterfly, supporting the life cycle of this iconic species."
