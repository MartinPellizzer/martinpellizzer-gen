    "intro": "Asplenium macraei, commonly known as the Macrae's spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spores in compact, club-shaped sorus clusters on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Asplenium macraei is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in humid forest ecosystems."
