    "intro": "Alexa herminiana, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, often blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
