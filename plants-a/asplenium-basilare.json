    "intro": "Asplenium basilare, commonly known as the basil fern, is a small evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Madagascar. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, arranged in a compact rosette. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in shaded forest floors. Asplenium basilare is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant."
