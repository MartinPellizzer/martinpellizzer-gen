    "intro": "Aloe viscosa var. indurata, commonly known as the rock aloe or hard-leaved aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in a white, powdery coating called farina. The leaves are typically gray-green in color and have a waxy texture that helps the plant retain moisture. It produces yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months, which are borne on tall, branched inflorescences. This species is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional medicine for its healing properties."
