    "intro": "Alchemilla abyssinica f. muscoidea, commonly known as the Abyssinian lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its dense, moss-like foliage. It features broad, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or rocky areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to form a lush, carpet-like ground cover."
