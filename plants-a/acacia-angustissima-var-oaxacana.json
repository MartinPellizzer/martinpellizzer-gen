    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia angustissima var. oaxacana is primarily native to southern Mexico, specifically the states of Oaxaca and Chiapas. This variant of the species is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these areas. It typically grows in dry to semi-arid environments, often in rocky or limestone soils. The plant is well adapted to the local climate and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat. It is commonly found in scrublands and along the edges of forests in its range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia angustissima var. oaxacana was mainly introduced to regions with a Mediterranean climate characterized by dry summers and mild, wet winters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in coastal areas and rocky slopes. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its deep root system and ability to withstand drought conditions. It has also been introduced as an ornamental plant in gardens and landscaped areas. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems."
