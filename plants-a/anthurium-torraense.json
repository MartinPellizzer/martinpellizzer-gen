    "intro": "Anthurium torraense, commonly known as the Torraense arrowhead, is a tropical plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are typically deep green with a waxy texture. The plant produces vibrant, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a colorful spathe, which can range from red to yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium torraense is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is popular in indoor gardening."
