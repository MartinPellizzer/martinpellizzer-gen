    "intro": "Ampelopsis heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It features compound leaves that vary in shape and size along the stem, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in late summer, followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds. Its vigorous growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover. The leaves are often used in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported health benefits."
