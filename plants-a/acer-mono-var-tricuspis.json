    "intro": "Acer mono var. tricuspis, commonly known as the three-lobed maple, is a variant of the Japanese maple characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves. This plant is native to Japan and is prized for its ornamental value, particularly during the autumn when its foliage turns vibrant shades of red and orange. The leaves are typically trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three pointed lobes, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its unique appearance, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a landscape specimen.",
