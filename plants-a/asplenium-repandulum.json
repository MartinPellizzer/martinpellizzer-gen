    "intro": "Asplenium repandulum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or drooping. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky crevices or on forest floors. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Asplenium repandulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity."
