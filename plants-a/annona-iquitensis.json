    "intro": "Annona iquitensis, commonly known as the Amazonian custard apple, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, with smooth, grayish bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by large, green, spiny fruits. The fruit has a thick, yellowish skin and a creamy, custard-like pulp that is rich in nutrients. It is well adapted to the humid, shaded understory of the rainforest environment."
