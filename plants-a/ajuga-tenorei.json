    "intro": "Ajuga tenorei, commonly known as the Sicilian bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom in early summer. Ajuga tenorei thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread and form a dense ground cover."
