    "intro": "Allium iatrouanum, commonly known as the Iatrouan onion, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Allium genus. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, clustered bulbs and has strap-like leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, forming loose umbels that bloom in the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
