    "intro": "Agave shrevei subsp. magna, commonly known as the giant Shreve agave, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, thick, fleshy leaves that can grow up to several feet in length, often with a bluish-gray hue. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear yellowish-green flowers, which are typically followed by the development of blue-gray, spiky fruits. It is a succulent, well adapted to dry conditions, storing water in its leaves and stems.
