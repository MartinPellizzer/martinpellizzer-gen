    "intro": "Angiopteris elongata, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large, tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its massive, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in pollination. Angiopteris elongata plays an important role in tropical ecosystems as a habitat provider and soil stabilizer."
