    "intro": "Athyrium cassum, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species native to East Asia. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit and produces delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, shield-like appearance. Its spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Athyrium cassum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, green foliage."
