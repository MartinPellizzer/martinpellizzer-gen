This cultivar is a variant of the sweet almond tree, characterized by its cascading branches that give it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. It produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by almond-like fruits. The leaves are broad and serrated, and the plant is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, though it can tolerate some shade."
