    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha commersoniana f. colorata is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Peru, and Bolivia. This plant thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich, well-drained soils. It is commonly found in the understorey of tropical rainforests and along riverbanks. The species is known for its striking, colorful bracts that attract various pollinators. Its natural distribution is largely restricted to these specific ecological zones within the Amazon and Andean regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha commersoniana f. colorata was mainly introduced to enhance ornamental value in gardens and landscapes due to its vibrant foliage. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in warm, humid climates. This cultivar is often used in container gardening and as a decorative plant in public spaces. Its introduction has led to its cultivation in various parts of the world, including the Caribbean, Southeast Asia, and parts of the United States. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native habitats."
