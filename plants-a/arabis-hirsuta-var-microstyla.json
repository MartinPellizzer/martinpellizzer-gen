    "intro": "Arabis hirsuta var. microstyla, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has hairy, lobed leaves that are adapted to retain moisture in harsh conditions. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in poor soils make it a hardy ornamental choice for rock gardens. The variety microstyla is distinguished by its shorter stature and more compact inflorescences compared to the typical form."
