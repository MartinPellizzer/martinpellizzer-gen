    "intro": "Agave parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often lined with white teeth. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for arid landscapes. Its compact size and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
