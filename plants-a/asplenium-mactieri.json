    "intro": "Asplenium mactieri, commonly known as the Mactier's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. This fern is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, such as cliffs or forest floors. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats. Asplenium mactieri is relatively low-maintenance and is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded conditions."
