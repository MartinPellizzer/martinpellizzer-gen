    "intro": "Agrostis minima, commonly known as mouse grass, is a small, tufted grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as lawns, roadsides, and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is a short-lived perennial, often forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in ecological restoration and turfgrass management."
