    "intro": "Anthurium monticola var. monticola, commonly known as the mountain anthurium, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of spadices, which are typically bright red or orange, surrounded by a spatulate leaf-like structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ease of care in suitable conditions."
