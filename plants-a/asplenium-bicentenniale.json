    "intro": "Asplenium bicentenniale, commonly known as the bicentennial spleenwort, is a rare and ancient fern species belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its small, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are typically clustered closely together. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in clusters called sori. Asplenium bicentenniale is often found growing on rock surfaces or in shaded, humid environments. Due to its rarity and historical significance, it is considered a valuable species in botanical studies."
