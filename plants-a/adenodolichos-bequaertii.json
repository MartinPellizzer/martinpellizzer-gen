It features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes. The plant bears pods that contain edible seeds, which are used in traditional cuisines. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in savanna and woodland areas. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a food source and its potential for agricultural use in underutilized crop systems.",
