    "intro": "Astragalus \u00d7 hybridus, commonly known as the hybrid milkvetch, is a perennial plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant is native to the western United States and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has a deep taproot system, allowing it to survive in arid conditions and making it drought-tolerant. Astragalus \u00d7 hybridus is also valued for its role in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
