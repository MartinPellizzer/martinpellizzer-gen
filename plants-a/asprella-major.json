    "intro": "Asprella major, commonly known as the large asprella, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange and are pollinated by birds, particularly sunbirds. The leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat."
