    "intro": "Arnica coloradensis, commonly known as Colorado mountain Arnica, is a perennial herb native to the high elevations of the Rocky Mountains. It features a rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are gray-green in color. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive central disk, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
