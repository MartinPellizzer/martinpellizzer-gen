    "intro": "Allium polyphyllum, commonly known as the mountain garlic, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of pale purple to white flowers in late summer. The plant belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is closely related to other allium species such as garlic and onions. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild garlic flavor, making it a valued plant in some traditional cuisines. Allium polyphyllum is also noted for its hardiness and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils."
