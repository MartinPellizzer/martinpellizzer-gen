    "intro": "Asplenium crenatifolium, commonly known as the notched spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of dark green, notched leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called soridia on the underside of its leaves, which are essential for its reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in temperate regions. Asplenium crenatifolium is a low-maintenance plant that is well-suited for rock gardens or as a houseplant."
