    "intro": "Alsophila acutula, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizome system supports the growth of its tall, fibrous trunk, while its fronds are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. Alsophila acutula is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be found in botanical gardens and tropical landscapes."
