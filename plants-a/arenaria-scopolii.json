    "intro": "Arenaria scopolii, commonly known as the sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or rocky soils, often found in coastal areas and dry habitats. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Arenaria scopolii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize sandy soils."
