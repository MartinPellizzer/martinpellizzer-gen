    "intro": "Amorphophallus angulatus, commonly known as the angular arrowhead, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaves and a short, stout stem. The plant produces a large, spadix-like inflorescence that is often mistaken for a giant vegetable due to its size and appearance. It is typically found in wetlands and marshy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soil. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local cultures."
