    "intro": "Astragalus sewertzowii var. leiophyllus, commonly known as the smooth-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor and drought-prone soils. Its small, pod-like fruits contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils. This variant is distinguished by its smooth, glabrous leaf surfaces, setting it apart from other members of the Astragalus genus."
