    "intro": "Alchemilla alpina genuina, commonly known as the Alpine Lady's Mantle, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its silver-gray, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous environments. Alchemilla alpina genuina is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its hardy nature and ornamental foliage."
