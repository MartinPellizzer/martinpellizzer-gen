    "intro": "Alchemilla alpina f. pseudogrossidens, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It produces achenes as its fruit, which are dispersed by wind, and it is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature and ornamental value. Its botanical features make it well-suited for alpine and subalpine habitats."
