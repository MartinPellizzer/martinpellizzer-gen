    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha reticulata var. longifolia is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks, where it can access ample water and nutrients. It is also occasionally found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. Its native distribution is closely tied to the moist, tropical climates of these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha reticulata var. longifolia was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its striking foliage and unique appearance. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its decorative value. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. It has been reported as an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative propagation contribute to its successful establishment in new environments."
