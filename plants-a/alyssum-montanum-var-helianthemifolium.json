    "intro": "Alyssum montanum var. helianthemifolium, commonly known as the goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is closely related to other alyssum species and shares similar ecological adaptations. It is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in xeriscaped gardens."
