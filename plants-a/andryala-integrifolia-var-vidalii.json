    "intro": "Andryala integrifolia var. vidalii, commonly known as the Vidal's broadleaf andryala, is a rare variant of the Andryala genus native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and dark green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
