    "intro": "Arrhenatherum almijarense, commonly known as the Almijar grass, is a species of grass native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, erect culms and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
