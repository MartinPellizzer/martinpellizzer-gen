    "intro": "Adesmia paranensis, commonly known as the Parana burrbean, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Argentina and Paraguay. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in shrubland and grassland habitats, often in regions with seasonal rainfall. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, and it produces edible seeds that are used in local cuisines. Adesmia paranensis plays a role in soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules.",
