It belongs to the Araceae family, which includes many plants with showy inflorescences. The plant produces striking, spadix-like flowers surrounded by a colorful spathe, typical of the genus Aneilema. Its rhizomes are used as a starchy food source, similar to arrowroot. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
