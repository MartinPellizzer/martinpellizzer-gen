It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are broadly ovate and have a distinctive, finely toothed margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rock crevices. Its fronds are pinnate, with the pinnae being sessile, giving it a unique appearance. Asplenium sessilifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
