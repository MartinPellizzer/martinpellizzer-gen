    "intro": "Asplenium rhizophorum var. supersum, commonly known as the giant rock fern, is a variant of the rock fern genus Asplenium. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky or crevice habitats. Its rhizomes are thick and robust, allowing it to anchor itself in challenging substrates. The fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, rugged texture that sets it apart from other fern species."
