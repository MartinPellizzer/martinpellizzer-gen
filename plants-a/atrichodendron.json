    "intro": "Atrichodendron, commonly known as the sandalwood tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its aromatic wood, which is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in dry or semi-arid environments. Atrichodendron species are shrubs or small trees with compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The genus includes several species, some of which are endangered due to overharvesting and habitat loss."
