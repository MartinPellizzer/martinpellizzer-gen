    "intro": "Aristolochia maxima var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, maroon-colored flowers that resemble a pipe, hence its common name. The plant has heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a rough texture and emits a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. The species is also notable for containing aristolochic acids, which are toxic compounds that have historically been used in traditional medicine."
