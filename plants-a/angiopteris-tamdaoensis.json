    "intro": "Angiopteris tamdaoensis, commonly known as the Tam Dao fern, is a species of giant fern native to Vietnam. It belongs to the family Angiopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Angiopteris tamdaoensis is of interest to botanists due to its evolutionary significance and unique morphological traits."
