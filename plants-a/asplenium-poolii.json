    "intro": "Asplenium poolii, commonly known as the Pool's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, narrow leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. This plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded environments. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with high humidity and moderate temperatures. Asplenium poolii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
