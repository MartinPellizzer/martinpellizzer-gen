    "intro": "Apargia hispida, commonly known as the rough apargia, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, loamy soils. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, bristly hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in loose panicles and bloom in late spring. Apargia hispida is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for native pollinators."
