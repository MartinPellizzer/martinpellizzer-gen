    "intro": "Acaena sanguisorbae subsp. aucklandica, commonly known as the Auckland bristly burr, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems and clusters of small, bright red berries that persist through winter. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are visited by native pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. The subspecies is notable for its ecological role in providing food for birds and its use in traditional M\u0101ori medicine.",

This subspecies thrives in coastal and lowland environments. It is commonly associated with sandy or gravelly soils near the shoreline. The plant is an important component of the local flora in these areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena sanguisorbae subsp. aucklandica was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habits. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can spread rapidly through its seeds. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local biodiversity and land management practices."
