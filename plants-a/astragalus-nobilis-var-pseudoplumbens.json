    "intro": "Astragalus nobilis var. pseudoplumbens, commonly known as the silverleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in dry, well-drained soils, often found in sagebrush steppe and rocky habitats. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. The variety is distinguished by its more robust growth and larger leaves compared to other Astragalus species."
