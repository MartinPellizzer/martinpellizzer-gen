    "intro": "Astragalus hadroacanthus, commonly known as the hard thorned milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to central Asia. It is characterized by its erect stems and trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers in globular clusters, typical of the Fabaceae family. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Astragalus hadroacanthus is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils."
