    "intro": "Acaena myriophylla, commonly known as the New Zealand bramble, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a member of the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a hairy texture. Acaena myriophylla thrives in coastal and subalpine environments, often forming thickets that provide habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena myriophylla is primarily native to Argentina Northeast, Argentina Northwest, Argentina South, and Brazil South. This plant is commonly found in grasslands and shrublands within these regions. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The species is adapted to withstand seasonal droughts and grazing pressure. Its distribution reflects its ecological preference for open habitats in southern South America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena myriophylla was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as a ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation in certain areas. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can tolerate both full sun and partial shade. Its spread has raised concerns among land managers and conservationists."
