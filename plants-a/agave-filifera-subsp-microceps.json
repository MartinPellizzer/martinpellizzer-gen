    "intro": "Agave filifera subsp. microceps, commonly known as the narrow-leaved agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and narrow, fibrous leaves that are often covered in a blue-gray waxy coating. The plant produces an inflorescence of yellowish-green flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its slow growth rate makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
