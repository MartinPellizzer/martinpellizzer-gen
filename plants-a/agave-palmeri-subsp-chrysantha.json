    "intro": "Agave palmeri subsp. chrysantha, commonly known as the yellow agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears yellowish-green bracts with small, white flowers. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Its botanical features make it well adapted to desert conditions, with a slow growth rate and long lifespan."
