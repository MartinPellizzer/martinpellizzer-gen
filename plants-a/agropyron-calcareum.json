It thrives in calcareous soils, often found in rocky or limestone-rich environments. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny grains. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Agropyron calcareum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
