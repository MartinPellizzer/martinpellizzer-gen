    "intro": "Acantholimon androsaceum var. majus, commonly known as the Androsace mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming structure and small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species.",

This plant is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous or coastal environments. The distribution of this variant reflects its adaptation to the diverse climatic conditions of the region. It is a relatively rare species with limited geographic range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon androsaceum var. majus was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils in temperate climates. It is commonly found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, gravelly slopes, and open woodlands. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often seen in regions with cool, humid summers. Its introduction has been noted in several regions of Europe and parts of North America. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and naturalized in the wild."
