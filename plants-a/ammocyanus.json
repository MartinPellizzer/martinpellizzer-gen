    "intro": "Ammocyanus, commonly known as the blue-eyed grass, is a member of the Poaceae family, though it is often mistaken for a member of the Cyperaceae family due to its grass-like appearance. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams. Ammocyanus is native to North America and is often found in the eastern and central United States. Its delicate foliage and early blooming habit make it a notable plant in ecological and botanical studies."
