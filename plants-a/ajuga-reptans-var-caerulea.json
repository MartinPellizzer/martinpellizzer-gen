It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright green, often with a bluish tinge. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers in early to mid-summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in partial to full shade and is well-suited for rock gardens, woodland gardens, or as a ground cover in shaded areas. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a resilient, decorative plant."
