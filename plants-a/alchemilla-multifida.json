    "intro": "Alchemilla multifida, commonly known as the lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, silver-white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shady garden areas. Alchemilla multifida is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
