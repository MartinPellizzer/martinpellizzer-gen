It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow panicle bearing small, spikelet-like flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its delicate, grass-like appearance."
