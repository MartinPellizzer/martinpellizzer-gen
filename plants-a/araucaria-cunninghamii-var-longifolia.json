    "intro": "Araucaria cunninghamii var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaf mountain pine, is a variant of the Australian white pine. It is characterized by its elongated, needle-like leaves that are typically longer than those of the typical species. The tree grows in the cool, moist regions of southeastern Australia, particularly in the highlands of New South Wales. Its cones are small and woody, containing edible seeds that are a food source for various wildlife. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in the region's flora."
