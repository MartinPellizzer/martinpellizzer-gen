    "intro": "Asperula crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved woodruff, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has leathery, elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its delicate blooms. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to shaded garden landscapes. Asperula crassifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
