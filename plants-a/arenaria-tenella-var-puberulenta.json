    "intro": "Arenaria tenella var. puberulenta, commonly known as the Downy Sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and western Asia. It features small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves covered in a fine, downy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
