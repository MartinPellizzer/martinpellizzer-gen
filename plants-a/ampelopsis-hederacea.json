    "intro": "Ampelopsis hederacea, commonly known as the curly-leaf honeysuckle, is a climbing vine native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed and have a distinctive curling appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its vigorous growth habit makes it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
