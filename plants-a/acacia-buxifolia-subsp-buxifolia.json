    "intro": "Acacia buxifolia subsp. buxifolia, commonly known as the boxleaf acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with small, rounded leaves that resemble boxwood leaves. The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for ornamental use in gardens and as a hedge.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia buxifolia subsp. buxifolia is primarily native to New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria. This subspecies is commonly found in the eastern regions of Australia, particularly in areas with dry to semi-arid conditions. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often seen in open woodlands and grasslands. The plant is well adapted to the local climate and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat. Its distribution is largely confined to these specific states due to environmental and climatic factors.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia buxifolia subsp. buxifolia was mainly introduced to India. It is commonly found in the southern regions of the country, particularly in states like Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and parts of Karnataka. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its dense foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. It has been reported in urban and suburban areas, where it is used for landscaping and soil stabilization. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems."
