    "intro": "Agrostophyllum carrianum, commonly known as the Carrian heath, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in winter, adding ornamental value to its habitat. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its often arid environment. Agrostophyllum carrianum plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
