It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, pale green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
