    "intro": "Astragalus macroptilus, commonly known as the large-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Astragalus macroptilus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
