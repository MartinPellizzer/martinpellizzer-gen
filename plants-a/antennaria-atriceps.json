It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and woolly, silver-gray foliage. The plant features small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often hidden beneath its dense, hairy leaves. Antennaria atriceps thrives in rocky and acidic soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in high-altitude ecosystems."
