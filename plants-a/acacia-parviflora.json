    "intro": "Acacia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces flat, elliptical seed pods that contain numerous small, rounded seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy regions. Acacia parviflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia parviflora is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is commonly found in the southern and central parts of the country, including Western Australia, South Australia, and parts of New South Wales. This plant thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often associated with shrublands and open woodlands. It is well adapted to dry climates and can tolerate high temperatures and limited rainfall. Acacia parviflora plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia parviflora was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in the Western Cape and along the eastern coast, thriving in coastal fynbos vegetation. This plant is often used for its ornamental value due to its delicate yellow flowers and its ability to tolerate poor soils. However, it has also been reported to spread into native ecosystems, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. Its introduction has led to discussions about its ecological impact and management in local flora."
