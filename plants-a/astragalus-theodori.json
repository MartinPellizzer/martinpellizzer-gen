    "intro": "Astragalus theodori, commonly known as Theodore's milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant produces small, rounded pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
