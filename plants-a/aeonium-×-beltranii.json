    "intro": "Aeonium \u00d7 beltranii, commonly known as the \"Black Rose\" or \"Black Aeonium,\" is a hybrid succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped growth pattern and dark, almost black foliage that contrasts strikingly with its bright green stems. The leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water, allowing the plant to thrive in arid environments. It produces clusters of yellow flowers in the spring, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise dark appearance. This plant is prized for its unique coloration and ease of care, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
