    "intro": "Acaena trifida var. robusta, commonly known as the New Zealand spinach or mountain spinach, is a shrub-like plant native to New Zealand. It features small, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers that develop into spiny, woody fruits. The plant is adapted to grow in rocky, alpine environments, often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its leaves are edible and have a spinach-like flavor, making it a traditional food source for M\u0101ori people. The species is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in stabilizing soils.",

This plant grows in a variety of habitats, including forests, shrublands, and coastal areas. It is commonly associated with the lower South Island and parts of the North Island. Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific regions within New Zealand.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena trifida var. robusta was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. The plant has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and open habitats. However, it is not considered invasive and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems."
