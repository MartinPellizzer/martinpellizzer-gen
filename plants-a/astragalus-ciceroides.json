    "intro": "Astragalus ciceroides, commonly known as the broadleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Its seeds are adapted for dispersal by wind, contributing to its spread across arid environments."
