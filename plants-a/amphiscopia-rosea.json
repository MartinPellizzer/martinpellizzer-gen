    "intro": "Amphiscopia rosea, commonly known as the rose-flowered marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features a slender, erect stem that can grow up to 30 centimeters in height, adorned with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers with a distinctive rose-colored lip, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system consists of a network of rhizomes that help it thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Amphiscopia rosea is typically found in bogs, fens, and other wetland environments where it plays a role in maintaining ecological balance."
