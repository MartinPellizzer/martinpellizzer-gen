    "intro": "Anemone flaccida var. tagawae, commonly known as the Hachijo anemone, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hachijo Islands in Japan. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces delicate, white to pale pink flowers with a distinctive, flaccid appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas with sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are basal, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its unique botanical profile. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
