    "intro": "Agrostophyllum trifidum, commonly known as the three-lobed lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits distinct botanical features. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its foliose thallus with a finely divided, lobed structure. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga, which contributes to its unique morphology and survival strategies. It typically grows on tree bark and rocks in temperate and subtropical regions. Its intricate thallus structure and chemical composition make it an important subject in lichenology and ecological studies."
