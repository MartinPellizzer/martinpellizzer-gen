    "intro": "Astragalus jagnobicus, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soils. Astragalus jagnobicus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
