    "intro": "Aspidium subcrenulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium subcrenulatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic or bog gardens."
