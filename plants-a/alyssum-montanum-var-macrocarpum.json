    "intro": "Alyssum montanum var. macrocarpum, commonly known as the large-seeded mountain alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, fragrant flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, often forming dense mats or low shrubs. Its flowers, which are usually pink or white, bloom in early spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The variety is distinguished by its larger, more prominent seed pods compared to other varieties of Alyssum montanum."
