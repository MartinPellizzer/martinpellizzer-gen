    "intro": "Apetalanthe, commonly known as the \"false dandelion,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its absence of true petals, with flowers composed of ray and disk florets. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lobed or toothed, and they produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are often surrounded by bracts. Apetalanthe species are found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. They are generally herbaceous perennials with a low-growing habit."
