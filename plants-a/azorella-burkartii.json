    "intro": "Azorella burkartii, commonly known as the Andean mat grass, is a low-growing plant native to the high Andes of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it survive in harsh, high-altitude conditions. Azorella burkartii is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in rocky or alpine regions."
