    "intro": "Ardisia pergamacea, commonly known as the glossy evergreen ardisia, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and small, urn-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces bright red berries that are edible for humans but can be toxic to some animals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in rainforests. Ardisia pergamacea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to tolerate partial shade."
