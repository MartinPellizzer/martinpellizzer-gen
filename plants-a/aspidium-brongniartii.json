    "intro": "Aspidium brongniartii, commonly known as the African shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are typically evergreen. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread across the forest floor. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Aspidium brongniartii is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky outcrops."
