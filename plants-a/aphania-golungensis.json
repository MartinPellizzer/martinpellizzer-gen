    "intro": "Aphania golungensis, commonly known as the Golungensis orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky crevices and moist, shaded environments, showcasing adaptations to its harsh habitat. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
