    "intro": "Astragalus francisquitensis, commonly known as the Francisquitensis milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Astragalus francisquitensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain wildlife. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in its native range."
