It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This species thrives in coastal and mangrove environments, often growing along riverbanks and estuaries. It is an important plant in local ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Its distribution is largely restricted to the Indo-Malayan region, where it plays a significant ecological role.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon avicennae var. cordatum was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, often found in coastal regions. It thrives in environments with moderate to high sunlight exposure and is commonly cultivated as an ornamental plant. This variety is particularly adapted to tropical and subtropical regions, making it popular in horticultural settings. Its introduction has been noted in several countries, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions, where it can outcompete native flora."
