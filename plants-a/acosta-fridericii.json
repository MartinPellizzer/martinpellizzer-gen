    "intro": "Acosta fridericii, commonly known as the Friar's acosta, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth texture, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.",
