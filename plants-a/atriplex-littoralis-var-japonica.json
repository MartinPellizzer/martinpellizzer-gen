    "intro": "Atriplex littoralis var. japonica, commonly known as Japanese saltbush, is a halophytic shrub native to coastal regions of East Asia. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, often found in tidal zones and coastal dunes. The plant has small, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces yellow flowers in compact clusters, typically blooming in summer. Its adaptability to harsh coastal conditions makes it an important species for stabilizing shorelines and preventing erosion."
