    "intro": "Anacamptis coriophora f. alba, commonly known as the white marsh orchid, is a rare and elegant orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its pale to white flowers, which contrast with its dark green, strap-like leaves. This orchid typically grows in wet meadows and marshy areas, preferring moist, nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces a single spike of flowers, which can have up to 15 blooms, each with a distinctive lip that is often white or pale pink. Its botanical features make it a unique and sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts and botanists."
