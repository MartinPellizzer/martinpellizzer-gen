    "intro": "Acetosella vulgaris, commonly known as wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its leaves contain oxalic acid, which gives the plant its sour taste and can be toxic in large quantities. Acetosella vulgaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.",
