    "intro": "Arenaria humifusa f. nana, commonly known as the dwarf sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of foliage close to the ground, with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which are borne on short, upright stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a hardy, low-maintenance ground cover."
