The plant is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, appear at the tips of the stems during the rainy season. Acrodiclidium appelii is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, making it a resilient and unique desert plant.",
