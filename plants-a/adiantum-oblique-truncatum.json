    "intro": "Adiantum oblique-truncatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features finely divided, arching fronds with a distinctive, narrow, and often slightly curved shape. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in shady, moist environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its intricate foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and indoor plant collections.",
