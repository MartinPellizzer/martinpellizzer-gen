    "intro": "Astragalus montis-nacarouzii, commonly known as the Nacarouz Mountain milkvetch, is a flowering plant species native to the mountainous regions of Turkey. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers arranged in racemes, typical of many Astragalus species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
