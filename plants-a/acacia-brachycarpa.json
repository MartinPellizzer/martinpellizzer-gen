    "intro": "Acacia brachycarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and feathery, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late summer, which are clustered in inflorescences. Its seed pods are short and curved, containing several seeds enclosed in a fibrous husk. Acacia brachycarpa is adapted to arid conditions and is often found in sandy soils.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia brachycarpa is primarily native to eastern and southern Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and South Africa. It is commonly found in savanna and woodland habitats, often growing in well-drained soils. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in regions with seasonal rainfall. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. Acacia brachycarpa is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia brachycarpa was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a warm, temperate climate. It is commonly found in regions with low to moderate rainfall. This plant thrives in full sun and is often used in landscaping due to its hardy nature. It has been introduced to several parts of the United States, particularly in the southwestern states. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts."
