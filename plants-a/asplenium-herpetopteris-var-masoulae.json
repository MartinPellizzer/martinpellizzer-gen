    "intro": "Asplenium herpetopteris var. masoulae, commonly known as the Masoula spleenwort, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that typically measure between 10 to 20 centimeters in length. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizomes often covered in a dense layer of rhizome scales. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a distinctively narrow and elongated shape. The spore-producing structures, or sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, typically near the base of the pinnae."
