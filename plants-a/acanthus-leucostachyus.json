This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these areas. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The species is well adapted to the diverse climates of its native range. It is often used in traditional medicine and horticulture due to its ornamental value.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus leucostachyus was mainly introduced to ornamental gardens and landscapes due to its striking foliage and architectural form. It is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun conditions. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region but has been cultivated in various parts of the world. Its introduction has sometimes led to naturalization in certain areas, raising concerns about its potential invasive behavior. Despite its beauty, it requires careful management to prevent it from spreading beyond controlled environments."
