    "intro": "Aspidosperma lanatum, commonly known as the woolly aspidosperma, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, lanate (woolly) foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a leathery texture. The woody stem and branching habit make it a distinctive member of the Apocynaceae family."
