    "intro": "Acantholimon sackenii, commonly known as the Sacken's thornscale, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, coastal environments. It has a compact growth habit and is often found in coastal dunes or cliffs. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species.",

It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on slopes or in crevices. The species is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of Central Asia. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches in the highlands of these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon sackenii was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, often in dry, rocky habitats. It is commonly found in Mediterranean climates where it thrives in warm, dry conditions with minimal rainfall. This plant is typically spread through seeds dispersed by wind, animals, or human activity. It has been reported in several regions outside its native range, including parts of California and the Mediterranean Basin. Due to its hardy nature, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
