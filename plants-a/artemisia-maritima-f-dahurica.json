    "intro": "Artemisia maritima f. dahurica, commonly known as Siberian tamarisk, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the cold regions of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, gray-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in compact clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This subspecies is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
