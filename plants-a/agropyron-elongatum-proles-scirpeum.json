    "intro": "Agropyron elongatum proles scirpeum, commonly known as the meadow bromegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, meadows, and along riverbanks. Agropyron elongatum proles scirpeum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
