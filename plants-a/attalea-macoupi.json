    "intro": "Attalea macoupi, commonly known as the pink palm or pink-fruit palm, is a species of palm native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish flowers that develop into bright red, fleshy fruits. The fruit is edible and has a sweet, acidic flavor, often consumed raw or used in local cuisines. It plays an important role in the ecosystems of the Amazon rainforest and is also valued for its ornamental and economic significance."
