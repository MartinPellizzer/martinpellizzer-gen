It is native to the island of Madagascar and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
