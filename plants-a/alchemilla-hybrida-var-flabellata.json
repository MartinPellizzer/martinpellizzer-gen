    "intro": "Alchemilla hybrida var. flabellata, commonly known as the golden alumroot, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features a rosette of broad, shiny, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, upright stalks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and long-lasting flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
