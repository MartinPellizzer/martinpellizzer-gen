It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that grow in clusters. This plant typically thrives in wet, marshy environments, showcasing its adaptation to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions. Its root system is less developed compared to the standard species, reflecting its specialized habitat. Despite its limited distribution, it holds significance in botanical studies due to its unique morphological traits."
