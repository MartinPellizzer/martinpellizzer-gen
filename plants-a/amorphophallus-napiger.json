    "intro": "Amorphophallus napiger, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a tropical plant native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, which float on the surface of still or slow-moving water. The plant produces strikingly large, white flowers that bloom at night, emitting a strong odor reminiscent of rotting meat to attract pollinators. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, allowing it to store nutrients and survive in aquatic environments. The plant plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water filtration."
