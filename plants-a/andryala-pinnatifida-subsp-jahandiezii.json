    "intro": "Andryala pinnatifida subsp. jahandiezii, commonly known as the Persian sandwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and low precipitation. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, linear leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Its botanical structure is characterized by a fibrous root system and a branching stem that may bear multiple inflorescences. This subspecies is of interest in ecological and botanical studies due to its resilience in harsh environments."
