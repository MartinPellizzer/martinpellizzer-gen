    "intro": "Anthemis arvensis var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal ragwort, is a variant of the common tansy that thrives in coastal and saline environments. It is characterized by its yellowish-green leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its structure is low-growing with a mat-forming habit, which helps it stabilize coastal dunes. This variety plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for specialized invertebrates."
