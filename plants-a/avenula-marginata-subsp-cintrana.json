It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in grassland or woodland habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or white along the margins. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
