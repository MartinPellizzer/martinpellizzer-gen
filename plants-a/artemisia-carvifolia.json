    "intro": "Artemisia carvifolia, commonly known as bluecurls, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, silvery-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. Its leaves contain volatile oils that contribute to its strong, minty scent. Artemisia carvifolia is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in arid environments."
