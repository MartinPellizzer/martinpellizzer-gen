    "intro": "Asplenium trapeziforme, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spleenwort, is a small evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a rosette. The plant has a rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures on the underside. It is native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and the Korean Peninsula. Asplenium trapeziforme is often found on rocks or in crevices, showcasing its adaptability to rocky, nutrient-poor habitats."
