It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and forest edges. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often silver-haired, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. This variety is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its delicate, feathery foliage."
