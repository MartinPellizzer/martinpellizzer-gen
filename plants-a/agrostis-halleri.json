    "intro": "Agrostis halleri, commonly known as Haller's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, grassy habitats such as meadows, dunes, and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowering period occurs in the summer months, and it is characterized by its ability to thrive in well-drained soils. Agrostis halleri is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
