    "intro": "Alchemilla hoppeana var. glacialis, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, silver-gray foliage that is covered in soft, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are often hidden beneath its foliage. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is well adapted to rocky or alpine soils. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
