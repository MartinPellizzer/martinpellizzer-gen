    "intro": "Androsace pennina, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense cushions of foliage, with small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Androsace pennina is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh conditions."
