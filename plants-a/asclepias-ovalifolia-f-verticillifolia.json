    "intro": "Asclepias ovalifolia f. verticillifolia, commonly known as the verticillifoliate milkweed, is a variant of the ovalleaf milkweed. It is characterized by its unique, whorled arrangement of leaves, which gives it its specific epithet \"verticillifolia.\" The plant produces clusters of pink to reddish-orange flowers, which are typical of the Asclepias genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. This form is particularly valued for its role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae."
