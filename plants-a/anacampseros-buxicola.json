It is characterized by its compact, rounded shape and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal watering, making it ideal for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
