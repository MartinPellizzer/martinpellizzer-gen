    "intro": "Ampelopteris prolifera, commonly known as the rock tassel fern, is a unique member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a small, creeping fern that typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, thriving in well-drained, sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its dense, wiry rhizomes and clustered, small, scale-like fronds. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Ampelopteris prolifera is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
