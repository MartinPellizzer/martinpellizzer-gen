    "intro": "Annona distincta, commonly known as the rough custard apple, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height. The plant produces large, waxy, green leaves with a rough texture and a strong, unpleasant odor. Its flowers are typically yellow with a red or purple calyx, and it bears yellow or orange fruits that are covered in a rough, bumpy skin. The fruit contains a creamy, custard-like pulp surrounded by a large, inedible seed."
