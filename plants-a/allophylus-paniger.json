    "intro": "Allophylus paniger, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and elliptical,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by distinctive, woody fruits containing a single seed. Allophylus paniger is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which has been traditionally used in carving and furniture making. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a threatened species in many parts of its range."
