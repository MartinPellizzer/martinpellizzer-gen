    "intro": "Astragalus albens, commonly known as white milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in dry, harsh environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus albens is often found in steppe and desert habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
