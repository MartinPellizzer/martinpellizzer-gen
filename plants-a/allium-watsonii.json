    "intro": "Allium watsonii, commonly known as Watson's garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs are similar to those of other alliums, containing sulfur compounds that contribute to its strong aroma. Watson's garlic is often found in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments."
