    "intro": "Artemisia tridentata var. bolanderi, commonly known as Great Basin sage, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and aromatic, pungent scent, which is due to the presence of volatile oils. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, including sagebrush steppe and desert landscapes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a distinctive tridentate margin, contributing to its identification. This variety plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
