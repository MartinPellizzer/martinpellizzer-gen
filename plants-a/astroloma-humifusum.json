    "intro": "Astroloma humifusum, commonly known as the coastal astroloma, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Australia. It features small, waxy leaves that are typically grey-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in coastal environments and well-drained soils, often found in sandy or rocky areas. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscaping."
