    "intro": "Annesorhiza calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola false indigo, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the western United States. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are trifoliate, and it produces small, pale blue to purple flowers during the spring and early summer. Annesorhiza calcicola plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying xerophytic adaptations."
