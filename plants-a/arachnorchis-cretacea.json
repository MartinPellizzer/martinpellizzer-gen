    "intro": "Arachnorchis cretacea, commonly known as the Cretaceous orchid, is a rare and ancient orchid species native to Australia. It is characterized by its unique, delicate flowers that resemble spider-like structures, hence its genus name \"Arachnorchis.\" The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
