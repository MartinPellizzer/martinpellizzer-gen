    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Aa calceata is primarily native to Bolivia and Peru. This plant is found in the Andean regions of these countries. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. The species is adapted to the cold and dry conditions of the Andes. Its native distribution is limited to these specific areas in South America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Aa calceata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species for resources. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in coastal and lowland areas. Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect local ecosystems."
