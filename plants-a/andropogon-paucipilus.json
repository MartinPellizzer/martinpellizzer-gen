    "intro": "Andropogon paucipilus, commonly known as narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and floodplain forests. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland environments. Andropogon paucipilus plays a vital role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
