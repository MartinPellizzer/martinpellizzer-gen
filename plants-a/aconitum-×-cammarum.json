    "intro": "Aconitum \u00d7 cammarum, commonly known as the hybrid aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is a cross between Aconitum napellus and Aconitum carpathicum, resulting in a plant with striking blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed foliage that adds to its ornamental value. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.",
