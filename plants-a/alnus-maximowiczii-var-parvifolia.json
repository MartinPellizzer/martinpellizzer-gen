    "intro": "Alnus maximowiczii var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches long. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration efforts."
