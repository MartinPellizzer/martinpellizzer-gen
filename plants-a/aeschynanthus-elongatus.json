    "intro": "Aeschynanthus elongatus, commonly known as the hanging lantern plant, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of showy, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aeschynanthus elongatus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant and long-lasting blooms."
