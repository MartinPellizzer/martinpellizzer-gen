    "intro": "Asclepias alexicaca, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking pink to red flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, a feature common among milkweeds. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Asclepias alexicaca plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae."
