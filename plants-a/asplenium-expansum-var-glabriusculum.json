    "intro": "Asplenium expansum var. glabriusculum, commonly known as the slender shield fern, is a variant of the broad shield fern native to the southeastern United States. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky outcrops. The plant features a compact, upright rhizome with lance-shaped, glossy, dark green fronds that are often covered in small, rounded spore cases. Its foliage is generally smooth and lacks the hairy texture found in some other asplenium species. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in shaded garden settings."
