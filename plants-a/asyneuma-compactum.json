It is a small, compact shrub that typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant features dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve water. Asyneuma compactum is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
