    "intro": "Arenaria modesta, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions. It typically features small, rounded leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Arenaria modesta plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas."
