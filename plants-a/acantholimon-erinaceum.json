    "intro": "Acantholimon erinaceum, commonly known as the prickly stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and small, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and ability to withstand harsh conditions make it a notable species in its native habitat. Acantholimon erinaceum is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon erinaceum is primarily native to Afghanistan, Iran, Turkmenistan, and Turkey. This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions across these countries. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often growing in mountainous or coastal areas. The species is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions, including high temperatures and low precipitation. Its native distribution reflects its ecological preference for dry, temperate environments.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon erinaceum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and moderate climates, often in disturbed or cultivated lands. It is commonly found in regions with a temperate climate, such as parts of Europe and North America. This plant thrives in open habitats like meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, including agricultural expansion and landscaping. However, it is generally considered a non-invasive species that does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems."
