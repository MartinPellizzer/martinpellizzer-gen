    "intro": "Artemisia obtusiloba, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial herb native to North America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite heads, which are visited by various pollinators. Artemisia obtusiloba is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
