    "intro": "Astrantia biebersteinii, commonly known as the Siberian dropwort, is a perennial herb native to the colder regions of Asia. It features a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in a dense, umbrella-like cluster. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
