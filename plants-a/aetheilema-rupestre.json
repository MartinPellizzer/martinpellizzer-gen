    "intro": "Aetheilema rupestre, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions due to its ability to store water in its leaves. Aetheilema rupestre is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
