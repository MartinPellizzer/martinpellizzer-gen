    "intro": "Allium umbilicatum, commonly known as the umbilical garlic or lesser garlic, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. Its bulbs are small and often used in culinary applications, though they are less common than other Allium species. Allium umbilicatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
