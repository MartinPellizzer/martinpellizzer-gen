    "intro": "Adenodolichos pachyrhizus, commonly known as the giant cowpea, is a climbing legume native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, trifoliate leaves and long, hairy stems that support its vigorous growth. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. Its roots are notable for their extensive, tuberous structures, which contribute to its nitrogen-fixing ability. This species is valued for both its nutritional seeds and its role in soil enrichment.",
