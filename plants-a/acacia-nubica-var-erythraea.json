It is also found in parts of Sudan and the Arabian Peninsula. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along coastal areas. It is commonly found in dry savannas and shrublands. Its distribution is closely associated with regions that have a dry climate and limited rainfall.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia nubica var. erythraea was mainly introduced to regions with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in areas with low rainfall and high temperatures, such as parts of North Africa and the Middle East. This plant is often used for its hardy nature and ability to prevent soil erosion. It has been introduced to various parts of the world for reclamation projects and as an ornamental plant. Due to its adaptability, it has become naturalized in some regions outside its native range."
