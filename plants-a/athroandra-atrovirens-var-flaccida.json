It features dark green, leathery leaves that are often slightly curled and have a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming during the cooler months. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged texture, while its branches are often drooping, giving it a distinctive, cascading form. This species is well adapted to sandy soils and salt spray, making it a hardy plant in coastal environments."
