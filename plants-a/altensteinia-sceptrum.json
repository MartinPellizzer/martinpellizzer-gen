    "intro": "Altensteinia sceptrum, commonly known as the golden crown fern, is a unique tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that give it a delicate appearance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are bioluminescent under certain conditions, a rare trait among ferns. Altensteinia sceptrum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
