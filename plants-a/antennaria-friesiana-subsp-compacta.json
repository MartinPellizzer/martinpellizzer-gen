    "intro": "Antennaria friesiana subsp. compacta, commonly known as the dwarf mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features a dense mat of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
