    "intro": "Acacia linifolia, commonly known as the coastal wattles, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous tiny leaflets, and the plant is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to withstand salt spray. The plant also plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
