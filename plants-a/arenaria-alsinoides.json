    "intro": "Arenaria alsinoides, commonly known as sand sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky habitats in the western United States. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in loose, sandy soils. Arenaria alsinoides is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
