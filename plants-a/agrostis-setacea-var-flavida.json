    "intro": "Agrostis setacea var. flavida, commonly known as the yellow hairgrass, is a variant of the hairgrass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and distinctive yellowish-green coloration, which sets it apart from other varieties of Agrostis. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in open, sunny environments such as meadows and grasslands. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences, and it is often found in association with other grasses and wildflowers. Botanically, it is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators."
