    "intro": "Aquarius subalatus, commonly known as the alpine water star, is a rare and unique plant species found in high-altitude regions. It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has a short, compact stem and possesses waxy, silver-green leaves that help it conserve water in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure to flourish. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
