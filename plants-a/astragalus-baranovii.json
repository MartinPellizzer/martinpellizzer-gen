    "intro": "Astragalus baranovii, commonly known as Baranov's milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant has compound leaves with stipules and produces pods that contain kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
