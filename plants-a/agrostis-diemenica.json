    "intro": "Agrostis diemenica, commonly known as the Diomedean bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the island of Tasmania. It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas or along stream banks. Its flowering period occurs during the spring and summer months, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Agrostis diemenica plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
