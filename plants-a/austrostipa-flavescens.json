It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear yellowish to brownish flowers, which are typical of the tribe Aristidoideae. Austrostipa flavescens is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils.
