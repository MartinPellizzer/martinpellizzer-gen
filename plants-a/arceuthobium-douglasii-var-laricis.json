    "intro": "Arceuthobium douglasii var. laricis, commonly known as the larch dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to larch trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, using specialized structures called haustoria to extract water and minerals. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green berries that contain seeds. It spreads primarily through wind-dispersed seeds, which can germinate on suitable host trees. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host and is considered a potential threat to larch forest ecosystems."
