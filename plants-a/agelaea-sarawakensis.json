    "intro": "Agelaea sarawakensis, commonly known as the Sarawak agelaea, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Araceae family, which includes plants such as philodendrons and peace lilies. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and a striking inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
