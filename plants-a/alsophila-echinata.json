    "intro": "Alsophila echinata, commonly known as the bristled tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive spore-producing structure called a sorus, which is located on the underside of its fronds. Alsophila echinata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of tropical flora."
