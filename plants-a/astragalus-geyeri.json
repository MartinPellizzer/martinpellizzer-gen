    "intro": "Astragalus geyeri, commonly known as the Geyeri milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, kidney-shaped seeds that are often covered in a fine, hairy coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, rocky environments. Astragalus geyeri plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat."
