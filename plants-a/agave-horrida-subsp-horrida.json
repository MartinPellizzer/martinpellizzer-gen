    "intro": "Agave horrida subsp. horrida, commonly known as the rough agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, blue-green leaves covered in sharp spines. The leaves are often lined with white to yellowish marginal teeth, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. It produces a tall, branched inflorescence with yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. This species is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
