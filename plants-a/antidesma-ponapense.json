    "intro": "Antidesma ponapense, commonly known as the Caroline balsa, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, simple leaves and yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often found in coastal or lowland areas. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature, aiding in its dispersal. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some regions."
