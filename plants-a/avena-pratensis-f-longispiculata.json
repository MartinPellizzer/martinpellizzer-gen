    "intro": "Avena pratensis f. longispiculata, commonly known as the long-spined oat, is a variant of the common oat species characterized by its elongated, stiff bracts. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant has slender, leafy stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets with elongated, bristly bracts. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive appearance. The long-spined bracts are a key feature that sets it apart from other oat varieties."
