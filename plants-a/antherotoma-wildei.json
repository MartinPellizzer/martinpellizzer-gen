    "intro": "Antherotoma wildei, commonly known as the African orchid bee, is a species of bee native to sub-Saharan Africa. It belongs to the family Apidae and is known for its unique role in pollination, particularly in orchid species. The plant it interacts with, such as certain orchids, has evolved specialized structures to facilitate this pollination process. Antherotoma wildei is also notable for its ability to carry pollen on its body, contributing to the genetic diversity of the plants it pollinates. Its presence is an indicator of healthy, biodiverse ecosystems in its native range."
