    "intro": "Acronema pneumatophobium, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, almost ethereal fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in dense forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typical of many ferns. Due to habitat loss, Acronema pneumatophobium is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.",
