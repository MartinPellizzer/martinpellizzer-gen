    "intro": "Astragalus aleppicus var. leiocarpus, commonly known as the Aleppo milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its erect stem and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in dry, rocky soils. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to prevent soil erosion."
