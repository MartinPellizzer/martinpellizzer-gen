    "intro": "[WRONG START] Adenanthos ilecticos, commonly known as the coastal wrens-tail, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Adenanthos ilecticos is well adapted to coastal environments and is often found in sandy soils along the coastline.",
