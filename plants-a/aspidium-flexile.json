    "intro": "Aspidium flexile, commonly known as the flexible water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Aspidium flexile is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant."
