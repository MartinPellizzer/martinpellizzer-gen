    "intro": "Astragalus geyeri var. triquetrus, commonly known as the three-angled milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, and its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are often hairy and lance-shaped. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
