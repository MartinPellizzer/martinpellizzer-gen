    "intro": "Arabis davidsonii, commonly known as Davidson's rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white, four-petaled flowers in early spring, which are arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
