    "intro": "Atropis maritima, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its spiky, blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it withstand salty sea air and strong winds. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along shorelines and dunes. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Atropis maritima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
