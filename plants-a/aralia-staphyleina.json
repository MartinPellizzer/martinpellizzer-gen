    "intro": "Aralia staphyleina, commonly known as the grape-leaf aralia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It features compound leaves that resemble grape leaves, with a distinctive palmate structure and serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbels, followed by berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Aralia staphyleina is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often used in landscaping for its upright growth habit."
