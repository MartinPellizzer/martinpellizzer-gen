    "intro": "Andropogon pichleri, commonly known as the Florida panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Andropogon pichleri plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
