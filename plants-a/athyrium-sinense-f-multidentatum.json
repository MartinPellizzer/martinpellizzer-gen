It features delicate, pinnately divided fronds with a distinctive, finely toothed margin that gives it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually bright green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
