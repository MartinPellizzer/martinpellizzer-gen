    "intro": "Adicea umbrosa, commonly known as the shadowy bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands and marshy areas of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, with slender, hairy stems that help it thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Adicea umbrosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens.",
