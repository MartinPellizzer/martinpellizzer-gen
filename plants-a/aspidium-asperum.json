    "intro": "Aspidium asperum, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are covered in small, rough tubercles, giving it a textured appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Aspidium asperum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
