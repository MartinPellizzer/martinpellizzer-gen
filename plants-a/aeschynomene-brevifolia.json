    "intro": "Aeschynomene brevifolia, commonly known as smallleaf aeschynomene, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial species belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. The plant features trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters. Its seeds are encased in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Aeschynomene brevifolia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
