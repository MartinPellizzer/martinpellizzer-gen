    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena hirta is primarily native to South America, particularly in regions of Chile and Argentina. It is commonly found in temperate climates, often growing in grasslands and shrublands. This plant thrives in areas with well-drained soils and is adapted to seasonal variations in temperature and precipitation. It is a member of the Rosaceae family and is known for its small, spiny fruits. Acaena hirta plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting local wildlife and contributing to soil stability.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena hirta was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century. The plant was initially cultivated for its ornamental value and as a potential forage crop. However, it has since become naturalized and is now considered an invasive species in many parts of the country. Its spread has led to concerns due to its ability to outcompete native vegetation."
