    "intro": "Aesculus macrostachya, commonly known as the American buckeye, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its palmately compound leaves, which are typically divided into five to seven leaflets. The plant produces showy, spiny, greenish-white flowers in clusters during late spring. Its fruit is a spherical, spiny capsule that contains one to three seeds. The leaves and seeds contain toxic compounds, making it important to handle the plant with care."
