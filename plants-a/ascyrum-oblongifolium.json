    "intro": "Ascyrum oblongifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with hairy stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense clusters, which bloom during the spring and early summer. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in sandy or rocky soils. Ascyrum oblongifolium plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and animals."
