It features a basal rosette of dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers in early summer, which are highly attractive to pollinators. Its stems are upright and can grow up to 30 cm in height, often adorned with glandular hairs. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings.",
