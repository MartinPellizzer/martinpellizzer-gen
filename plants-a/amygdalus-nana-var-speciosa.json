    "intro": "Amygdalus nana var. speciosa, commonly known as the dwarf almond or the showy almond, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It features small, rounded leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its ornamental value, with showy blossoms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a specimen plant. Due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal, it is a popular choice in horticulture for its spring display."
