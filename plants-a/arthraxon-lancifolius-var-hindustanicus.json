    "intro": "Arthraxon lancifolius var. hindustanicus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf arthraxon, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia, including India and Nepal. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, pale blue or white flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. This variant is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
