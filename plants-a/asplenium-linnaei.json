    "intro": "Asplenium linnaei, commonly known as the Linnaeus's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments, often in temperate regions. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes and produces delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a serrated margin. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves, clustered near the leaf tips. Asplenium linnaei is characterized by its simple, non-branching fronds and is often found in rocky or forested habitats."
