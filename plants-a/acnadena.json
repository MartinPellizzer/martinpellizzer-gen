    "intro": "Acnadena, commonly known as the \"Cape rose\" or \"Cape hibiscus,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It comprises several species native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where they thrive in coastal and mountainous regions. The plants are characterized by their showy, often pink or red flowers that resemble those of hibiscus, and their woody stems. Acnadena species are typically shrubs or small trees, with simple, alternate leaves that are often hairy. They play an important role in local ecosystems and are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value."
