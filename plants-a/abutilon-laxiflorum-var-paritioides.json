It is commonly found in countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, and parts of Brazil. This plant thrives in humid, warm climates and is often associated with lowland forests and disturbed areas. It is known for its ornamental value due to its hairy stems and showy flowers. Its natural range extends into some Caribbean islands as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon laxiflorum var. paritioides was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique flower structure. It is commonly found in gardens and cultivated areas in California and other western states. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact."
