It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pod-like fruits. The plant is often found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind. Ate acuminata is also valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a source of fodder for livestock."
