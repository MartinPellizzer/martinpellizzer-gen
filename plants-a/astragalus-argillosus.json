    "intro": "Astragalus argillosus, commonly known as clay milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in dry, rocky, or clayey soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow to brown flowers in late spring. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Astragalus argillosus is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
