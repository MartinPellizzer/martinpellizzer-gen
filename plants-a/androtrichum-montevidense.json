    "intro": "Androtrichum montevidense, commonly known as the Montevideo hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Uruguay and southern Brazil. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine, hair-like structures, contributing to its common name. Androtrichum montevidense is typically found in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and riverbanks."
