    "intro": "Anatherum holcoides, commonly known as the tall wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun. Anatherum holcoides is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
