    "intro": "Artemisia viscosa, commonly known as bastard wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its gray-green, aromatic leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the summer months. Artemisia viscosa is often found in dry, rocky soils and can thrive in harsh environmental conditions. It has been historically used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
