    "intro": "Abutilon grandiflorum, commonly known as the Chinese lantern plant, is a flowering shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its velvety, ovate leaves and showy, lantern-shaped yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant blooms and unique foliage. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in the wild.",

It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with forest understories or riverine habitats. It is known for its ornamental value due to its hairy leaves and showy flowers. Its distribution spans across much of sub-Saharan Africa, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon grandiflorum was mainly introduced to Florida, Norfolk Island, and Spain. It is a flowering plant native to South America but has been cultivated in these regions for ornamental purposes. The introduction of this species has led to its establishment in local ecosystems, sometimes as an invasive species. Its presence in these areas is often associated with human activity, such as horticulture and landscaping. The plant's adaptability to different climates has contributed to its spread across these locations."
