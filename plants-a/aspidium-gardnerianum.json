    "intro": "Aspidium gardnerianum, commonly known as the Gardner's water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bioluminescent at night. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating its reproductive cycle."
