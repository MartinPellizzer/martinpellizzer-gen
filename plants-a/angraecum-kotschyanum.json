    "intro": "Angraecum kotschyanum, commonly known as the Kotschyan's orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy white flowers with a distinctive greenish-brown throat. The plant typically blooms at night, producing a strong, sweet fragrance to attract its specific pollinators, such as the hawkmoth. Its leaves are long and narrow, adapted to capture moisture from the humid air. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is highly valued in botanical collections and conservation efforts."
