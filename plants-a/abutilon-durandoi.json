This plant thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often growing in dry environments. It is commonly found in the southern and southeastern parts of Algeria. Abutilon durandoi is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon durandoi was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in full sun to partial shade. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and along riverbanks due to its adaptability. This plant has been reported in several tropical and subtropical countries, including parts of South America and Southeast Asia. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a potential invasive species in some areas. However, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities, making it a popular choice for landscaping in certain regions."
