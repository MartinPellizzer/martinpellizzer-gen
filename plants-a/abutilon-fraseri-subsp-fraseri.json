    "intro": "Abutilon fraseri subsp. fraseri, commonly known as Fraser's abutilon, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slightly pubescent surface. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in arid and semi-arid regions. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and seasonal flowering.",

This species is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions across these states. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. The plant is well adapted to the dry climate of its native range. It is a valuable component of the local flora and plays a role in supporting native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon fraseri subsp. fraseri was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, stream banks, and forest edges. This subspecies has become naturalized in several regions, often outcompeting native vegetation. Its rapid growth and adaptability contribute to its success in introduced areas. However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive spread."
