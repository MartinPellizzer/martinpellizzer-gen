    "intro": "Aspidium craspedocarpum, commonly known as the broad-leafed wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its large, triangular-shaped fronds that are divided into soft, lobed segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of its fertile fronds. Aspidium craspedocarpum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, foliage."
