It is characterized by its striking reddish pigmentation in the leaves and bracts, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its foliage is lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs, while its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for both decorative and culinary purposes in certain regions."
