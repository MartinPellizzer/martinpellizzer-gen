    "intro": "Athyrium sylvaticum, commonly known as the forest maid or the Japanese painted fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically bright green with a reddish or brownish hue on the underside. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Athyrium sylvaticum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
