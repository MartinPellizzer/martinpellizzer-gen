    "intro": "Arbutus leucocarpa, commonly known as the white-tipped bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green with a white or pale waxy coating on the underside. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and mammals. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Arbutus leucocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
