    "intro": "Andropogon tomentellus, commonly known as silky bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silver-gray foliage due to the fine, silky hairs covering its leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common component of native grasslands and prairies. Andropogon tomentellus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
