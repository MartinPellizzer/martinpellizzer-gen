    "intro": "Arthropteris altescandens, commonly known as the rock holly fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia, including regions of China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are often used in rock gardens due to their ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread slowly and form dense mats. Its leaves are typically divided into small, serrated segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. Arthropteris altescandens is well adapted to rocky or forested habitats and is often found growing on soil or among rocks in humid climates."
