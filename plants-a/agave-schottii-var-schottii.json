It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with small, white flowers that bloom in late summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Its striking appearance and resilience make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
