    "intro": "Agropyron glabrispiculatum, commonly known as the smooth spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and spike-like inflorescences that are typically smooth and glabrous. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Agropyron glabrispiculatum is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
