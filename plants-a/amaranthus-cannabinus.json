    "intro": "Amaranthus cannabinus, commonly known as Indian hemp, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its erect growth habit, simple leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of small, greenish to reddish flowers. The plant produces small, dry fruits called capsules, which contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in warm climates and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in fields. Due to its fibrous stalks, it has been historically used for fiber production and as a source of food."
