    "intro": "Acantholimon caesareum, commonly known as the blue flax or skyblue flax, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or sky-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers during the summer months. Acantholimon caesareum is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon caesareum is primarily native to Turkey. It is found in various regions across the country, particularly in the central and southern areas. This plant thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing on slopes and cliffs. It is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of Turkey, with periods of drought and warm summers. Its distribution is closely linked to the unique geological and climatic conditions of the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon caesareum was mainly introduced to stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion in coastal areas. It is commonly found in regions with sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. This plant is well adapted to harsh maritime conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its introduction has helped in restoring degraded coastal habitats. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential impacts on native plant communities."
