    "intro": "Anthericum fibrosum, commonly known as the fibrous lily, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern North America. It features strap-like, fibrous leaves that are often used in traditional basket-making due to their strength and flexibility. The plant produces showy, white or pale pink flowers with six petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Anthericum fibrosum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
