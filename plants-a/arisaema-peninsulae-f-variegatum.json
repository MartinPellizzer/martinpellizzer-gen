    "intro": "Arisaema peninsulae f. variegatum, commonly known as the Variegated Peninsula Arum, is a unique cultivar of the Arisaema genus native to the Korean Peninsula. It is characterized by its striking variegated foliage, featuring a mix of green, white, and yellow hues on its broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces an unusual spadix surrounded by a spathe, typical of the Arum family, though its coloration differs from the standard species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. This cultivar is relatively rare and requires specific care to maintain its distinctive appearance."
