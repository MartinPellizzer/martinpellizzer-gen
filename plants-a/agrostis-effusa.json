    "intro": "Agrostis effusa, commonly known as the hairy meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, needle-like leaves that are often covered in short, stiff hairs. This plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a compact, cylindrical cluster of spikelets, which are usually pale green to reddish in color. Agrostis effusa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals."
