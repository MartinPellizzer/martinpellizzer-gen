It is characterized by its upright, cylindrical stems and narrow, gray-green leaves with white margins. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear showy, tubular flowers in shades of yellow to orange. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its striking appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid landscapes."
