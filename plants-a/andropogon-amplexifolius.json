    "intro": "Andropogon amplexifolius, commonly known as broadleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its wide, flat leaves and tall, upright stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are typically blue to purple in color, which contribute to its common name. It thrives in full sun and is often found in prairies, woodland edges, and disturbed sites. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it ecologically valuable in native plant restoration projects."
