    "intro": "Agropyron orientale, commonly known as the oriental wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces spikelets that are typically 3 to 5 cm long, with bristle-like awns at the tips of the florets. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green coloration. Agropyron orientale is adapted to dry, semi-arid environments and is often used in erosion control and forage production."
