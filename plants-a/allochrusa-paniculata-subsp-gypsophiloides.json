    "intro": "Allochrusa paniculata subsp. gypsophiloides, commonly known as the gypsophiloides subshrub, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-water environments."
