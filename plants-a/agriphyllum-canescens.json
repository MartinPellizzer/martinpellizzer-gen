    "intro": "Agriphyllum canescens, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Agriphyllum canescens plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native insects and small animals."
