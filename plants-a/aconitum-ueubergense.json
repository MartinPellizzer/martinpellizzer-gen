    "intro": "Aconitum ueubergense, commonly known as the European aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in racemes along the stem. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed divisions, and are typically arranged alternately along the stem. Aconitum ueubergense contains potent alkaloids, making it toxic and requiring careful handling."
