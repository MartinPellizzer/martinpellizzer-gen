It features a rhizomatous root system and produces striking, arrow-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy surface. The plant's flowers are clustered in a spadix, enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is cultivated in some regions for both horticultural and traditional uses."
