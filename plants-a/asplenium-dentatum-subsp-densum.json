    "intro": "Asplenium dentatum subsp. densum, commonly known as the dense tooth fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its dense, finely divided fronds that give it a lush, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to substrates and absorb moisture. The fronds are usually bioluminescent, exhibiting a unique glow under certain light conditions, which aids in its ecological interactions."
