    "intro": "Asplenium ruta-muraria var. lanceolum, commonly known as the lanceolate rock fern, is a perennial fern native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
