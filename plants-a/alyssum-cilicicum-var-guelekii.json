    "intro": "Alyssum cilicicum var. guelekii, commonly known as the Guelekii alyssum, is a rare and endemic species native to Turkey. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant features hairy stems and leaves with a distinctive, slightly woolly texture. It thrives in rocky or calcareous soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
