    "intro": "Armeriastrum restiaceum, commonly known as the coastal sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a low-growing annual herb that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in the arid coastal environment. Armeriastrum restiaceum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native insects and birds."
