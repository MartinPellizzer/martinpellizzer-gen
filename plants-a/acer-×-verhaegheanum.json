    "intro": "Acer \u00d7 verhaegheanum, commonly known as the Belgian maple, is a hybrid deciduous tree resulting from the cross between Acer platanoides and Acer saccharum. It features a rounded crown with dense, dark green foliage that turns vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The tree produces small, winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and adaptability to various soil types. However, it is less hardy than some other maple species and may require protection in colder climates.",
