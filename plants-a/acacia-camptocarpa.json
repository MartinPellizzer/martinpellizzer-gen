    "intro": "Acacia camptocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically narrow and feathery, and its yellow flowers that appear in globular or cylindrical clusters. The plant produces flat, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Acacia camptocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in horticulture for its hardy nature and seasonal floral displays.",

This plant thrives in coastal and inland regions, often growing in shrublands and woodlands. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native habitat. Acacia camptocarpa plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and stabilizing soil in its environment.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia camptocarpa was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the northern and central parts of the country. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber and fuel. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its ability to spread rapidly. It is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing properties, making it beneficial for agricultural land improvement."
