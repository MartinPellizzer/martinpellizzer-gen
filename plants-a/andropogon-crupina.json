    "intro": "Andropogon crupina, commonly known as rough bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture, and its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a common component of native grasslands. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
