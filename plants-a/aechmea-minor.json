    "intro": "Aechmea minor, commonly known as the small pineapple bromeliad, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater. The plant produces a striking flower spike that can bear multiple blooms, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aechmea minor is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance."
