    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acampe congesta is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa. It is found in regions such as the Eastern Cape, Western Cape, and parts of KwaZulu-Natal. This plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils in open woodland and grassland habitats. It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas with a Mediterranean climate. Acampe congesta is well adapted to the dry and warm conditions of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acampe congesta was mainly introduced to control invasive plant species in disturbed areas. It is commonly used in restoration projects to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant. It has been introduced in several regions of the United States, particularly in the western states. However, its use is sometimes debated due to potential ecological impacts."
