    "intro": "Amorphophallus virosus, commonly known as the giant corpse flower, is a striking plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its massive, spadix-shaped inflorescence that can grow up to three meters in height. The plant produces a strong, unpleasant odor resembling decaying flesh, which attracts pollinators such as flies and beetles. It has large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to two meters in diameter, contributing to its dramatic appearance. The plant is known for its long dormancy periods, often going through several years of growth before flowering."
