    "intro": "Actinidia eriantha, commonly known as the silver vine, is a deciduous climbing shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped, dark green leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in early summer, followed by blue-black berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its leaves are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Actinidia eriantha is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and is also used in traditional medicine.",
