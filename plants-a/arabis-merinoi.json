    "intro": "Arabis merinoi, commonly known as Merino's rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants known for their cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers appear in clusters, often in spring, and are accompanied by basal leaves that are lobed and hairy. Arabis merinoi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
