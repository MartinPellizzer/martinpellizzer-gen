    "intro": "Asplenium remotum, commonly known as the remote spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spores in clusters called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium remotum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its simple morphology and adaptability make it a common species in temperate regions."
