    "intro": "Arctostaphylos tomentosa subsp. subcordata, commonly known as the subcordate bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, leathery, oval leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories or rocky areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
