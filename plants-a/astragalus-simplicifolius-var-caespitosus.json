    "intro": "Astragalus simplicifolius var. caespitosus, commonly known as the clustered milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, palmately divided leaves. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed sites. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
