It features feathery, finely divided fronds that resemble buttons, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats or clusters. Adiantum parallelogrammum is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its elegant appearance and air-purifying qualities.",
