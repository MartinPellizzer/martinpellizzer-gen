    "intro": "Atriplex minuticarpa, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to saline and drought-prone environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep water sources and stabilize sandy soils. Atriplex minuticarpa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
