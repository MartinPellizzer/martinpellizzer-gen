    "intro": "Athyrium conilii, commonly known as the rock fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a perennial fern characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium conilii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and shaded landscapes."
