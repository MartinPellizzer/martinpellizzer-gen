    "intro": "Aronicum glaciale, commonly known as the glacier bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of North America. It produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a bluish tinge. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help protect it from cold temperatures. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
