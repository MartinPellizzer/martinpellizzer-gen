    "intro": "Afrodaphne nitida, commonly known as the slender sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its smooth, aromatic bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by oval, woody fruits. Afrodaphne nitida is valued for its essential oils, which are used in perfumery and traditional medicine. Its slow growth and limited distribution make it a rare and ecologically significant species."
