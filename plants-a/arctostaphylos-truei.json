    "intro": "Arctostaphylos truei, commonly known as the coastal manzanita, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Pacific coast of North America. It is characterized by its reddish-brown bark and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, leathery berries that are typically red or black when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats. Arctostaphylos truei is adapted to mild, moist climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
