    "intro": "Aquilegia vulgaris var. longisepala, commonly known as the long-sepaled columbine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features striking, spurred flowers that range in color from blue to purple, with long, narrow sepals that give it its common name. The plant has compound, trifoliate leaves with a serrated margin, and it thrives in well-drained, moist soils in partial shade. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and can be found in wildflower meadows. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
