    "intro": "Anchusa ottomanum, commonly known as Ottoman bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features showy, trumpet-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. It prefers well-drained soil and is drought-tolerant once established. Anchusa ottomanum is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and can naturalize in suitable climates."
