    "intro": "Alectryon carinatus, commonly known as the horned melastome, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive horn-shaped calyx lobes, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters. Its leaves are opposite and often have a velvety texture, while its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule. Alectryon carinatus is adapted to the humid, tropical environments of its native habitat."
