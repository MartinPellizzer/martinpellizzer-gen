    "intro": "Acalypha microphylla, commonly known as the velvetleaf or small-leaved acalypha, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are densely covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a soft texture. Its flowers are clustered in umbels and are typically yellow or greenish in color. Acalypha microphylla is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha microphylla is primarily native to El Salvador, Mexico Central, Mexico Northwest, Mexico Southeast, Mexico Southwest, and Nicaragua. This species is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It thrives in humid environments, often growing in disturbed soils or along stream banks. The plant is known for its small, delicate leaves and is often found in lowland forests. Its native range spans across several Central American countries, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha microphylla was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through seed dispersal. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact."
