    "intro": "Asplenium caryotoides, commonly known as the broad-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, dark green fronds that are typically broad and lance-shaped. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Asplenium caryotoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
