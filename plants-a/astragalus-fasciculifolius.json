    "intro": "Astragalus fasciculifolius, commonly known as the clustered leaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves with multiple leaflets arranged in clusters. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. It has a deep taproot system, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor and drought-prone environments. Astragalus fasciculifolius is often found in steppes, deserts, and rocky areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
