It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves distinguish it from the more hairy form of the species. It produces pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals.",
