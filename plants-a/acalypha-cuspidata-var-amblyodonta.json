    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha cuspidata var. amblyodonta is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical rainforests and moist lowland areas. This variant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil. It is often seen growing in shaded undergrowth or along stream banks. The plant is known for its distinctive foliage and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha cuspidata var. amblyodonta was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The introduction occurred during the 19th century as part of the broader introduction of exotic plants for horticultural purposes. It has since become naturalized in some regions, particularly in the North Island. However, it is not considered invasive and poses minimal ecological risk."
