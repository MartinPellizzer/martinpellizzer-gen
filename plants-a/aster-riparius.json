    "intro": "Aster riparius, commonly known as the river aster, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is typically found growing along riverbanks and wetlands, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flower heads that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Aster riparius plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
