    "intro": "Astragalus eriostomus, commonly known as the silky milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy, often sprawling growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow to greenish flowers clustered in dense heads, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, rounded leaflets covered in fine, silky hairs. Astragalus eriostomus is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat."
