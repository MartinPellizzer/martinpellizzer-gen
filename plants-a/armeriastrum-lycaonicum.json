    "intro": "Armeriastrum lycaonicum, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, perennial shrub that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are adapted to reduce water loss, making it well-suited for dry conditions. Armeriastrum lycaonicum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
