    "intro": "Asperula incana, commonly known as the silverleaf woodruff, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and woodland settings. Asperula incana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
