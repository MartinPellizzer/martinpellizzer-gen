    "intro": "Acer obtusatum, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to Japan and Korea. It is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 meters, with a broad, rounded crown. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming more fissured with age. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters before the leaves emerge in early spring.",
