This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these states. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as deserts and scrublands. The species is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of the southwestern United States. Its distribution is largely restricted to the western parts of the country where it plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acamptopappus sphaerocephalus var. sphaerocephalus was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in the western regions. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and open habitats such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas. This plant has been documented in states like California, Nevada, and Arizona. Its introduction is believed to be through human activities, including transportation of contaminated soil or seeds. Due to its adaptability, it has established itself in various ecological zones within these regions."
