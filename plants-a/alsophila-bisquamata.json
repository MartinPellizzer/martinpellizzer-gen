    "intro": "Alsophila bisquamata, commonly known as the broad-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, rough-textured cortex. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that are typically arranged in a tight spiral around the trunk. Its rhizomes are robust and help anchor the plant in moist, shaded environments. Alsophila bisquamata plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems, providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
