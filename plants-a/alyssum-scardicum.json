It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming from spring to early summer. The plant has aromatic, glandular leaves that produce a sticky secretion, which helps deter herbivores. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Alyssum scardicum is also valued for its ability to attract beneficial insects like bees and butterflies."
