    "intro": "Acronia baezensis, commonly known as the Baez Mountain acronia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.",
