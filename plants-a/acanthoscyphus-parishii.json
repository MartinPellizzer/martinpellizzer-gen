    "intro": "Acanthoscyphus parishii, commonly known as the New Zealand starfish flower, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a short, hairy stem and is native to the coastal regions of New Zealand. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided, fern-like lobes that help it adapt to its maritime environment. Acanthoscyphus parishii is an endangered species, threatened by habitat loss and invasive species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthoscyphus parishii is primarily native to California. It is found in specific regions within the state, particularly in coastal and inland areas. This plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline. It is often associated with dune environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of the coastal climate. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species within California.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthoscyphus parishii was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was first recorded in the 1960s and has since spread throughout the country. This plant is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. It is considered a potential weed due to its ability to thrive in various conditions. Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems."
