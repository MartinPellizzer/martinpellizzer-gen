    "intro": "Astragalus myriocladus, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and it produces slender, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through deep root systems and drought tolerance. Astragalus myriocladus plays a role in stabilizing soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
