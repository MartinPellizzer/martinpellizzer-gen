    "intro": "Aspidium drepanum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, rounded groups called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. Aspidium drepanum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
