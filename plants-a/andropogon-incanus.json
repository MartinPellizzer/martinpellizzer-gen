    "intro": "Andropogon incanus, commonly known as hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, fluffy inflorescence that resembles a tuft of hair, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open woodlands and prairies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture. Andropogon incanus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
