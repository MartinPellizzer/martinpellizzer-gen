    "intro": "Aspidosperma obscurinervium, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *Cerbera obscurinervis*, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by orange-red berries that contain toxic seeds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine, though its parts are poisonous. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
