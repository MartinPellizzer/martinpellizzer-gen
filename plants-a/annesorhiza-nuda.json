    "intro": "Annesorhiza nuda, commonly known as the naked root grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and wet meadows. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Botanically, it is characterized by its lack of visible stems and its fibrous root system."
