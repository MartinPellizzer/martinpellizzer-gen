    "intro": "Astragalus dengolanensis, commonly known as the Dengolan milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or violet. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
