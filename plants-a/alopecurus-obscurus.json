    "intro": "Alopecurus obscurus, commonly known as dark hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with inconspicuous flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its common name. Alopecurus obscurus is often found in disturbed soils and can serve as an indicator plant for certain ecological conditions."
