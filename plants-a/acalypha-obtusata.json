    "intro": "Acalypha obtusata, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a tropical flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha obtusata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often seen in forest understories or near water bodies. It is also native to parts of the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii and the Philippines. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions outside its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha obtusata was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions. It is commonly used in tropical and subtropical regions for its vibrant leaf colors and ability to thrive in both full sun and partial shade. The plant has been introduced to several countries, including parts of the United States, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. It is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and public spaces. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain environments."
