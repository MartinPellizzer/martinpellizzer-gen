It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate floral structure. The plant typically produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.",
