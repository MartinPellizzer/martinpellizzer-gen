It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces cylindrical seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems."
