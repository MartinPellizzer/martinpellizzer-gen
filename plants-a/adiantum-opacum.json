    "intro": "Adiantum opacum, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of polypodiaceae that is native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, shield-shaped fronds that are typically grayish-green in color. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new fronds along their length. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Adiantum opacum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or wooded areas.",
