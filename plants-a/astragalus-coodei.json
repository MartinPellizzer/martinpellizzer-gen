    "intro": "Astragalus coodei, commonly known as the Coode's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in dry conditions. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its ecological importance lies in its ability to fix nitrogen, enriching the soil for other plant species."
