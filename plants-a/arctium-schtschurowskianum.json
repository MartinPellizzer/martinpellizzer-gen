It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces purple to pink flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the daisy family. Its most distinctive feature is the spiky, bur-like fruit that aids in seed dispersal.
