    "intro": "Asparagus capitatus subsp. capitatus, commonly known as the clustered asparagus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, branched stems that often form dense clusters, and its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in compact, terminal clusters, which give it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique growth habit."
