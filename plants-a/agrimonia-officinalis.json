    "intro": "Agrimonia officinalis, commonly known as common agrimony, is a flowering plant in the rose family (Rosaceae). It is native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa, and thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by red, velvety fruits known as achenes. Its leaves are pinnately lobed and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are typically hairy and branched. Agrimony has been historically used in herbal medicine for its purported astringent and anti-inflammatory properties."
