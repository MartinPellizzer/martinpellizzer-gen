    "intro": "Acer shangszeense var. anfuense, commonly known as the Anfu maple, is a rare and ornamental species native to China. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions with cool, moist climates, preferring well-drained soil. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts.",
