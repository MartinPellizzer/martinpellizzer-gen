    "intro": "Austromimusops, commonly known as the southern moa, is an extinct genus of flightless birds native to New Zealand. It belonged to the family Dinornithidae, which included several large, herbivorous bird species. Austromimusops had a robust body and strong legs adapted for walking and foraging on the forest floor. Its diet likely consisted of leaves, fruits, and other plant material found in its native habitat. Fossils of Austromimusops have been found in various locations across New Zealand, providing insights into the paleoecology of the region."
