    "intro": "Aegilops neglecta, commonly known as the slender wild wheat, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both sterile and fertile florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a blue-green coloration. Aegilops neglecta is of interest to botanists and geneticists due to its potential contributions to wheat genetics and evolution."
