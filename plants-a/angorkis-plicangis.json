    "intro": "Angorkis plicangis, commonly known as the wavy-leaf orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, wavy-edged leaves and delicate, fragrant blooms that typically appear in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded forest understories. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the thin soil layers, and it has a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Due to habitat loss, Angorkis plicangis is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
