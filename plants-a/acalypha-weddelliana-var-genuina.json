This species thrives in humid, tropical climates and is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. It is often associated with disturbed or open habitats, such as forest edges and riverbanks. The plant is known for its striking foliage and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental species. Its distribution is limited to specific islands and regions within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha weddelliana var. genuina was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since become naturalized in several regions. The plant is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. It is considered a weed in some parts of its range due to its aggressive growth habit. Its introduction is believed to have occurred through accidental seed dispersal via human activities."
