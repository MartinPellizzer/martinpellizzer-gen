It features a distinctive, umbrella-shaped inflorescence with a white spathe and a yellowish spadix, which is typical of the Araceae family. The plant has heart-shaped, arrowhead-like leaves that are glossy and dark green. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks.
