    "intro": "Arthrosolen miniata, commonly known as the miniature rock orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in well-drained, sunny environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a dense rosette near the ground. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
