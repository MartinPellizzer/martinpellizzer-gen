    "intro": "Ardisia purpurea, commonly known as the purple beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. The plant has glossy, dark green leaves and a compact growth habit, making it suitable for ornamental purposes in gardens. It thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil. The berries are a key feature, adding visual interest to the plant throughout the fall and winter seasons."
