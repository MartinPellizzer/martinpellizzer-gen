    "intro": "Asplenium pseudoceii, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. The plant has a compact, clustered growth habit with dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium pseudoceii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady gardens or as a houseplant."
