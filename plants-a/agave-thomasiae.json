    "intro": "Agave thomasiae, commonly known as Thomas's agave, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick, fleshy, and covered in a layer of white wax. The leaves are typically blue-gray in color and have a spiny margin, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear small, white flowers, which are pollinated by insects. This plant is well adapted to dry climates and requires minimal water once established."
