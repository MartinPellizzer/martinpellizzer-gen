    "intro": "Aeridostachya malleifera, commonly known as the slender-stemmed orchid, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Africa. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
