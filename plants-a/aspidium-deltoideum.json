    "intro": "Aspidium deltoideum, commonly known as the delta fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that are typically arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread across the forest floor. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Aspidium deltoideum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental foliage in horticulture."
