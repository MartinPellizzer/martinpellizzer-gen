    "intro": "Alnus incana var. serrulata, commonly known as the roughleaf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its serrated, ovate leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellow catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along streams. This species is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration efforts."
