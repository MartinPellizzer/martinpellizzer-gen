    "intro": "Artemisia minutiflora, commonly known as dwarf sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its small, gray-green leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open plains. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. Artemisia minutiflora is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used traditionally by Indigenous peoples for various purposes."
