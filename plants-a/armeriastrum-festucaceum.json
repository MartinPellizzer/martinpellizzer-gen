    "intro": "Armeriastrum festucaceum, commonly known as coastal grassvetch, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats on sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny white or pale blue flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its resemblance to grass species. It is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and strong winds."
