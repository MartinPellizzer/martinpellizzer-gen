It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which contribute to its distinctive appearance and aid in moisture retention. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or rocky habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
