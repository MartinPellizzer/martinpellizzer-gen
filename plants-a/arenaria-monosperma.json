    "intro": "Arenaria monosperma, commonly known as the single-seeded sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Arenaria monosperma is adapted to harsh environments and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils."
