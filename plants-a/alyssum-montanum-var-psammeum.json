It features small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring and early summer. The plant has succulent, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to drought-tolerant landscapes."
