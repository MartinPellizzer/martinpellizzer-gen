    "intro": "Aldama fabrisii, commonly known as the Mexican orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, upright stems and delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments at high elevations. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
