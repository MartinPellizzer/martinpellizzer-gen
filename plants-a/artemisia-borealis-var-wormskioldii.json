    "intro": "Artemisia borealis var. wormskioldii, commonly known as the Arctic wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its gray-green, fuzzy foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in harsh, cold environments and is often found in tundra and rocky areas. It has a strong aromatic scent due to the presence of volatile oils in its leaves. This variant is distinguished from other Artemisia species by its compact growth habit and specific geographic distribution."
