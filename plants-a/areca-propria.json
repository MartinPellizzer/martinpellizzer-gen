It is a tall, slender palm with pinnate leaves that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant produces clusters of edible fruits, known as betel nuts, which are enclosed in a fibrous covering. The leaves are often used in traditional practices, including chewing betel quid. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
