    "intro": "Albizia zygia, commonly known as the silky albizia, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in summer. Its seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that split open when mature. Albizia zygia is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often used in landscaping for its shade and aesthetic appeal."
