    "intro": "Asplenium rusciforme, commonly known as the clubmoss fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to various regions of the world, including parts of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth habit with tightly clustered, dark green, leathery leaves. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Asplenium rusciforme is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
