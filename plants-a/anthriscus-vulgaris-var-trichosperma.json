    "intro": "Anthriscus vulgaris var. trichosperma, commonly known as parsley weed or cow parsley, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often mistaken for true parsley. The plant produces small, white or greenish-white flowers in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Its rapid growth and invasive tendencies make it a common weed in gardens and agricultural fields."
