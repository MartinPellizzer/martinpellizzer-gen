    "intro": "Aeschynomene zigzag, commonly known as zigzag aeshynomene, is a flowering plant species native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive zigzagging stems, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in racemes, and it produces small, elliptical seeds. Aeschynomene zigzag is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
