It features finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shady environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for shaded garden settings.",
