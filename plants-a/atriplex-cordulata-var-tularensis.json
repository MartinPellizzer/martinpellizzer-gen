    "intro": "Atriplex cordulata var. tularensis, commonly known as the desert saltbush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. This species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for wildlife."
