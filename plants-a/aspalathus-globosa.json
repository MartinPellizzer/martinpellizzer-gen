    "intro": "Aspalathus globosa, commonly known as the Cape tea or African green tea, is a small shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spherical growth habit and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native region. Due to its high antioxidant content, it is widely cultivated for its health benefits and used in herbal teas."
