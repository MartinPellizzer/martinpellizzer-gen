    "intro": "Aspidium rigidum f. fallax, commonly known as the variable holly fern, is a fern species belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically shorter and more compact compared to the typical form of *Aspidium rigidum*. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests and along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, a common reproductive feature among ferns. The varietal form 'fallax' is distinguished by its variable leaf morphology, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
