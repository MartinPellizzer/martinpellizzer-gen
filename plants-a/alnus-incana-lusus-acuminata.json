    "intro": "Alnus incana lusus acuminata, commonly known as the rough alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age, and its alternate, simple, ovate leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by woody, cone-like fruits that release winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or near water sources. This species is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in soil restoration efforts."
