    "intro": "Arenaria herniariifolia, commonly known as sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that produce small, white or pink flowers. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, exposed habitats. Its ability to survive in extreme conditions makes it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
