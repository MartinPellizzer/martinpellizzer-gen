    "intro": "Astragalus flexuosus var. sierrae-blancae, commonly known as Sierra White Astragalus, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of California. It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval leaflets, and it typically grows in well-drained soils in open woodland or meadow habitats. It is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of high elevation environments. This variety is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological role."
