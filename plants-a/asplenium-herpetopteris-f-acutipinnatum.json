    "intro": "Asplenium herpetopteris f. acutipinnatum, commonly known as the acute-pinnate spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and small, dark green, ovate to lanceolate leaves. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with finely divided pinnae that give the plant a delicate appearance. This fern prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and relatively rare species within the Asplenium genus."
