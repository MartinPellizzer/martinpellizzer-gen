    "intro": "Anthyllis \u00d7 baltica, commonly known as the Baltic anthyllis, is a hybrid plant species resulting from the cross between Anthyllis vulneraria and Anthyllis cytisoides. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and bright yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its floral structure consists of small, pea-like flowers with a distinctive spurred petal, typical of the Fabaceae family. Anthyllis \u00d7 baltica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators in its native range."
