    "intro": "Aristida mohrii, commonly known as Mohri's grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
