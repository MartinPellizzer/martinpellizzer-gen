    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha schiedeana f. angustifolia is primarily native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Tanzania, Kenya, and Uganda. It is commonly found in moist, shaded forest understories and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and is often associated with lowland and montane rainforests. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions. It is not widely distributed beyond these areas and is considered a regional endemic.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha schiedeana f. angustifolia was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It is commonly found in cultivated landscapes and gardens, where it is valued for its unique leaf patterns and vibrant colors. Despite its ornamental appeal, it has the potential to become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its ability to spread rapidly and outcompete native vegetation."
