    "intro": "Aspidium aristatum, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, sword-shaped fronds that are typically evergreen and can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a central stem that sends out lateral shoots. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Aspidium aristatum is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices."
