    "intro": "Ajuga fauriei, commonly known as carpet bugle or bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with oval, dark green leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ajuga fauriei thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in woodland gardens for its ornamental value. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form thick, carpet-like layers in suitable conditions."
