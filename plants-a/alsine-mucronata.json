    "intro": "Alsine mucronata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces tiny, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Alsine mucronata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
