    "intro": "Ammoselinum butleri, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, succulent foliage and yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has adapted to harsh environments through features such as thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater sources. Ammoselinum butleri plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its ecosystem."
