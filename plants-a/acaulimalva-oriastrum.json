    "intro": "Acaulimalva oriastrum, commonly known as the desert mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, flat seeds. Acaulimalva oriastrum is adapted to thrive in poor soils and can withstand extreme temperatures, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems.",

It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The species is adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of the Bolivian highlands. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is part of the native flora of the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaulimalva oriastrum was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in disturbed areas. It is commonly used in rehabilitation projects due to its rapid growth and ability to establish quickly. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in roadside embankments and degraded lands. Its introduction has helped prevent soil erosion in several regions. However, it can become invasive if not managed properly."
