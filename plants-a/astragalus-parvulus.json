    "intro": "Astragalus parvulus, commonly known as small milkvetch, is a small annual legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and rocky areas. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, pinnately compound leaves with numerous leaflets. Its flowers are usually yellow or pale green, forming in clusters at the ends of the stems. Astragalus parvulus is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important plant in ecological restoration efforts."
