    "intro": "Astragalus tenuiscapus, commonly known as narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, usually hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Astragalus tenuiscapus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
