    "intro": "Asplenium normale var. angustum, commonly known as narrow-leaf rock fern, is a variant of the common rock fern characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It is a small, evergreen fern typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinct, segmented appearance. It produces spores in compact clusters on the underside of its fronds, a feature typical of ferns. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
