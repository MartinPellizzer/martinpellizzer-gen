    "intro": "Aulaxanthus ciliatus, commonly known as the silky ciliate fern, is a rare and delicate species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely frilled, ciliate margins on its leaves, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its fronds are usually elongated and pinnate, with a soft, silky texture that distinguishes it from other ferns. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
