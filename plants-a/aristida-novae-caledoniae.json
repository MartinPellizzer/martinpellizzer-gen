    "intro": "Aristida novae-caledoniae, commonly known as the New Caledonia wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to the island of New Caledonia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as coastal dunes and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and unique ecological role, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
