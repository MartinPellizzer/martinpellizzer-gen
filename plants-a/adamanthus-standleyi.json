    "intro": "Adamanthus standleyi, commonly known as the African snowball tree, is a member of the Proteaceae family. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized shrub or tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are leathery and evergreen, providing a striking contrast to the white floral display. Adamanthus standleyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.",
