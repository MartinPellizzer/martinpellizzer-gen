    "intro": "Agrostis trachyphylla var. majuscula, commonly known as the rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, wiry stems that often form dense, compact clumps. The leaves are typically narrow, rough to the touch, and have a bluish-green coloration. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle, with small, two-lobed glumes and spikelet-like flowers. This plant is often found in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, meadows, and pastures, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
