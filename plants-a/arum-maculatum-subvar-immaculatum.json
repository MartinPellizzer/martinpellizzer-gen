It features a distinctive, arrow-shaped leaf that is typically bright green with a waxy texture. The plant produces a showy, white spadix surrounded by a pale green spathe, which gives it its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant is noted for its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense colonies in suitable habitats."
