    "intro": "Alnus serrulata f. emarginata, commonly known as the serrated alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its finely serrated leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant is typically found in moist, well-drained soils, often in riparian zones or near streams. Its small, yellowish-green catkins are an important source of pollen for early-season pollinators. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting local wildlife."
