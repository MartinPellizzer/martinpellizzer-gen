    "intro": "Acer mono subsp. tricuspis, commonly known as the three-lobed maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southwest China. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are divided into three pointed lobes. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and greyish, becoming fissured with age. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant autumn foliage.",
