    "intro": "Amauropelta prominula, commonly known as the small shield fern, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, shield-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common reproductive feature in ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or on rocky substrates. Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and delicate species."
