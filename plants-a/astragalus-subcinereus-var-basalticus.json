The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often on slopes or in crevices, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that help reduce water loss. The species is known for its ecological importance, providing forage for wildlife and contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitat."
