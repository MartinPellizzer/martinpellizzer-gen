    "intro": "Arthrochilus prolixus, commonly known as the long-stemmed rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southern regions of Western Australia. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open habitats such as heathlands and coastal areas. The plant features a slender, upright stem that can reach up to 30 centimeters in height, bearing several lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, often clustered in a loose spike, and are adapted to attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
