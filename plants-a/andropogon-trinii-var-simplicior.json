    "intro": "Andropogon trinii var. simplicior, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a distinctive blue-gray hue due to a waxy coating. This variety is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairie habitats."
