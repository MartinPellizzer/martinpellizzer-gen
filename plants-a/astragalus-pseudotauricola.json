    "intro": "Astragalus pseudotauricola, commonly known as the Crimean milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the steppes of southern Ukraine and Crimea. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and its root system is extensive, adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its ecosystem. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in protected natural reserves."
