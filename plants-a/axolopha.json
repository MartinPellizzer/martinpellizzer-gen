    "intro": "Axolopha, commonly known as the false holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and the Americas. The plants are characterized by their compound leaves and small, clustered flowers that are often white or yellow in color. Axolopha species are typically found in dry or semi-arid environments, where they can thrive with minimal water. They are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
