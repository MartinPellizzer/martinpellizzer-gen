    "intro": "Agrostis holciformis, commonly known as the bentgrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and fine, bluish-green foliage. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Agrostis holciformis is a perennial species that spreads through rhizomes and stolons, forming compact clumps. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in turfgrass mixes."
