    "intro": "Aloe ortholopha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically narrow and pointed, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers on tall, branching stems during the warmer months. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that is often used for its soothing properties. Aloe ortholopha is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves to survive drought conditions."
