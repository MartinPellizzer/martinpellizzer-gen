    "intro": "Antidesma brunneum, commonly known as the African starfruit or sour starfruit, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits that resemble star-shaped berries. The fruit is edible, though the taste is generally sour, and it is used in local cuisines and traditional medicine. Antidesma brunneum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique appearance."
