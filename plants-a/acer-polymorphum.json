    "intro": "Acer polymorphum, commonly known as the variable maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its diverse leaf shapes, which can range from palmately lobed to narrowly ovate, depending on the specific variety. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is typically smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Acer polymorphum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in forest ecosystems.",
