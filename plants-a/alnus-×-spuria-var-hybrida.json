    "intro": "Alnus \u00d7 spuria var. hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources. This species is valued for its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
