It is characterized by its fragrant, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain hard-shelled nuts, similar to those of the common almond. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with serrated edges. Amygdalus campaniflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beautiful spring blossoms."
