    "intro": "Agrostis linkii subsp. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats on the ground, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wet meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its botanical features include rhizomes that help it spread vegetatively, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects. This subspecies is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity in its habitat."
