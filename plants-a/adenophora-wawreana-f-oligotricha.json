    "intro": "Adenophora wawreana f. oligotricha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bellflower, is a rare and diminutive flowering plant native to the Appalachian Mountains. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is often found in shaded woodland areas. Its leaves are narrow and lanceolate, and it produces small, clustered flower clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.",
