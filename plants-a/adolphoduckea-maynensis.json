    "intro": "Adolphoduckea maynensis, commonly known as the Maynensia duckweed, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lemnaceae. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. The plant lacks true roots and stems, instead relying on rhizoids for anchorage and nutrient absorption. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in South America. Due to its rapid growth rate, it can become invasive in certain water bodies if not managed properly.",
