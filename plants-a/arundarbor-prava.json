    "intro": "Arundarbor prava, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage and delicate, fragrant blooms that appear in late spring. The plant has a complex root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by nocturnal moths, which are attracted to its strong nighttime scent. Due to habitat loss, Arundarbor prava is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
