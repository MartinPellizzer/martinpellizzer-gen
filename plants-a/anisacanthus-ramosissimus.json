It is characterized by its branching structure and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves and is adapted to arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and ornamental gardening."
