It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, blue-gray leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears clusters of yellow flowers, which are followed by small, greenish fruits. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in the production of tequila."
