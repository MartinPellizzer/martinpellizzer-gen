    "intro": "Astragalus pseudomahoschanicus, commonly known as the Sierra foothill milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and open woodlands. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers in late spring. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus pseudomahoschanicus is part of the legume family, capable of fixing nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria."
