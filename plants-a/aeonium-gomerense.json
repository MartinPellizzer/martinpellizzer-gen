    "intro": "Aeonium gomerense, commonly known as the Gomer's aeonium, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern, with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces striking pink or red flower stalks during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Aeonium gomerense is relatively drought-tolerant, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
