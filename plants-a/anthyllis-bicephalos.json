It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive two-headed appearance due to its clustered flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.

Anthyllis bicephalos is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas."
