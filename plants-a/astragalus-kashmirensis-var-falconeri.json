    "intro": "Astragalus kashmirensis var. falconeri, commonly known as the Kashmir falconeri milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, typical of many legumes. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, particularly in Kashmir and northern India. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
