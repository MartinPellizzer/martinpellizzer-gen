    "intro": "Aptosimum arenarium, commonly known as the sand saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid and rocky regions of the Mediterranean. It has small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in loose, sandy soils. Aptosimum arenarium is often found in coastal and inland dunes, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion."
