    "intro": "Axonopus chloridiformis, commonly known as the velvet grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and fine, soft foliage that gives it a velvety appearance. The plant typically grows low to the ground, with slender stems and small, narrow leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, gardens, and disturbed areas. Axonopus chloridiformis is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to form dense turf under favorable conditions."
