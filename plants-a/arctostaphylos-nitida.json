    "intro": "Arctostaphylos nitida, commonly known as the coast buckthorn, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to western North America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in clusters, which are usually pink or white, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is also cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
