    "intro": "Anotis nummularia var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth anotis, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Australia. It features rosettes of silver-gray, ovate leaves that are smooth and hairless, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
