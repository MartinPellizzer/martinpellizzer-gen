    "intro": "Aeglopsis mangenotii, commonly known as the African ghost fern, is a rare and enigmatic fern species native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in dense tropical forests. Its spores are dispersed through wind, and it plays a minor but ecologically significant role in its native habitat. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
