    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelia coreana var. insularis is primarily native to the Korean Peninsula, specifically the islands of Jeju Island and Goto Islands. This variant of Abelia coreana is found in coastal and mountainous regions, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is commonly associated with rocky outcrops and shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect its natural habitat from environmental degradation.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia coreana var. insularis was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive floral display and adaptability to various growing conditions. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its showy clusters of pink to white flowers. This variety is particularly valued for its compact size and ability to thrive in partial shade, making it suitable for a range of garden settings. It has been widely distributed across the eastern and southern regions of the country. However, its introduction has also raised concerns about potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems."
