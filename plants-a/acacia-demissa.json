    "intro": "Acacia demissa, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to saline and coastal conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for coastal landscaping.",

It is commonly found in the southern regions of the state, particularly in the areas around the Geraldton and Esperance regions. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and inland habitats. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range. Acacia demissa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia demissa was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and on sandy soils, often forming dense thickets. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in harsh, arid conditions, making it a resilient species. It is widely used for erosion control and as a source of timber and fuelwood. However, its invasive potential has raised concerns in some parts of its range."
