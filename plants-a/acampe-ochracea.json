This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these countries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks. The species is part of the Rubiaceae family and is known for its ornamental value. Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to diverse ecological conditions in South and Southeast Asia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acampe ochracea was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It is considered an invasive species in the region. The plant was likely introduced through accidental means, such as transport on contaminated soil or equipment. It has since spread to various parts of the country, outcompeting native vegetation. Efforts are being made to control its spread and prevent further ecological damage."
