It is characterized by its aromatic, branched stems and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces oval, greenish-white fruits that are covered in fine, rough hairs. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a strong, licorice-like scent when crushed. Anil rugosa is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and fragrant qualities."
