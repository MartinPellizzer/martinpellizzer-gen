    "intro": "Astragalus eremiticus var. spencianus, commonly known as the Spence's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, hard-coated seeds that are adapted for dispersal in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its low water requirements, it is considered a drought-tolerant species suitable for xeriscaping."
