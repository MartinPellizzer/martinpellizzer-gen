It features lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in wetlands and along the edges of streams, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
