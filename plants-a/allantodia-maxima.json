    "intro": "Allantodia maxima, commonly known as the giant allantodia, is a striking member of the Acanthaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. Its flowers, which are typically violet or purple, are clustered in dense inflorescences and bloom during the rainy season. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticulture."
