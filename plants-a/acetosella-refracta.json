    "intro": "Acetosella refracta, commonly known as the purple sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Acetosella refracta thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves contain oxalic acid, giving them a tart flavor and making the plant useful in some culinary applications.",
