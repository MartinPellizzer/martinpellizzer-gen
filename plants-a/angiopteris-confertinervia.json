    "intro": "Angiopteris confertinervia, commonly known as the dense-veined water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, pinnately divided fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and as ornamental plants due to their striking appearance."
