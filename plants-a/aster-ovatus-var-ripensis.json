    "intro": "Aster ovatus var. ripensis, commonly known as the riparian aster, is a flowering plant native to North America, particularly found in moist, riparian habitats. It is a perennial herb that typically grows along riverbanks and stream edges, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, blooming in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
