    "intro": "Aspalathus cymbiformis var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy flat sedge, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with hairy surfaces, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in wet, marshy areas and is often found in riparian zones. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually green or pale yellow, and it produces small, round fruits. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland environments."
