    "intro": "Adonis autumnalis var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf autumn adonis, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers in late summer to early autumn. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its delicate nature, it requires careful cultivation to ensure its survival in colder climates.",
