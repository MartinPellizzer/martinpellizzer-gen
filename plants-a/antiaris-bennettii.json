    "intro": "Antiaris bennettii, commonly known as the giant arrowroot, is a large, fast-growing shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and the Caribbean. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its palm-like leaves and showy, spadix-bearing inflorescences. The plant produces a starchy rootstock that is used as a food source in some regions, though it contains toxic compounds that require careful preparation. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common invasive species in certain areas. The plant's botanical features include thick, waxy leaves and a fibrous, tuberous root system."
