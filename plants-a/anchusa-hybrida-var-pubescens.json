It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its varietal name \"pubescens.\" The plant produces striking clusters of blue to violet flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and drought tolerance."
