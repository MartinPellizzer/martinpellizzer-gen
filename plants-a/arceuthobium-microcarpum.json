    "intro": "Arceuthobium microcarpum, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches to the branches of coniferous trees. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by animals. It is native to North America and is often found in forested areas with suitable host trees. Its botanical significance lies in its unique parasitic lifestyle and role in forest ecosystems."
