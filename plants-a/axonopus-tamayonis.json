    "intro": "Axonopus tamayonis, commonly known as the narrowleaf stoloniferous grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and creeping growth habit, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Axonopus tamayonis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
