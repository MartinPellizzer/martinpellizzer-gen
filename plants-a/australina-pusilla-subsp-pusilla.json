    "intro": "Australina pusilla subsp. pusilla, commonly known as the small-flowered Australina, is a small shrub native to the southern regions of Australia. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It is often found in open woodlands and heathlands, contributing to the biodiversity of these ecosystems."
