    "intro": "Arenaria diantha, commonly known as the pink sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in rocky or sandy soils. Arenaria diantha plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and subalpine meadows."
