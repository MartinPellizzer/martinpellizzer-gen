    "intro": "Aleuritopteris niphobola, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green and have a soft, velvety texture. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Aleuritopteris niphobola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
