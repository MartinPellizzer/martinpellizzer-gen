    "intro": "Aria arvonicola, commonly known as the silverleaf arnica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of silvery, fuzzy leaves that help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers in the summer, which are clustered in dense, branched inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Aria arvonicola is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory effects."
