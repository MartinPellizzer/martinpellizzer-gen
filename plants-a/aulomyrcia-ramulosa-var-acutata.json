    "intro": "Aulomyrcia ramulosa var. acutata, commonly known as the sharp-leaved alpine shrub, is a perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are sharply pointed, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in its cold, arid environment. This variant is particularly adapted to rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountain slopes."
