    "intro": "Archibaccharis lucentifolia, commonly known as the shining flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of southeastern Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, fiery red to orange flowers that bloom in clusters during the late summer and early autumn. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it a luminous appearance. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it often produces small, winged fruits that disperse its seeds by wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
