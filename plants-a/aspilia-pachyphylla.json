    "intro": "Aspilia pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a branched inflorescence, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its stems are often woody and can become branched with age, contributing to its shrub-like appearance. Aspilia pachyphylla is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy plant for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
