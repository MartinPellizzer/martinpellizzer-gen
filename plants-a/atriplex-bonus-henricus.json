    "intro": "Atriplex bonus-henricus, commonly known as sea blite, is a halophytic plant adapted to grow in saline environments. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help retain water. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in panicles, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. Atriplex bonus-henricus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize coastal dunes and improve soil quality."
