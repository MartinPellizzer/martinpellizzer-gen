It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic fern that typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves with finely serrated margins, which give it its common name. Its fronds are usually dark green and possess a distinctive, compact growth habit. Asplenium acutiserratum is often found in shaded, moist habitats across temperate regions."
