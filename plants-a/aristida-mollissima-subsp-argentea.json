    "intro": "Aristida mollissima subsp. argentea, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
