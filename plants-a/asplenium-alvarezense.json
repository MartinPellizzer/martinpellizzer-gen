    "intro": "Asplenium alvarezense, commonly known as the Alvarez's spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
