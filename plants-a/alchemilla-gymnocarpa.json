    "intro": "Alchemilla gymnocarpa, commonly known as narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
