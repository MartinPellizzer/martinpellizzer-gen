    "intro": "Allium parciflorum, commonly known as the sparseflower garlic, is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale purple flowers in late spring. Its bulbs are similar to those of other allium species, used in culinary and medicinal applications. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
