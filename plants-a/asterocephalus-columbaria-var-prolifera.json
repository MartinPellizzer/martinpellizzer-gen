    "intro": "Asterocephalus columbaria var. prolifera, commonly known as the dwarf starhead, is a low-growing, mat-forming succulent native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features dense clusters of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container plantings."
