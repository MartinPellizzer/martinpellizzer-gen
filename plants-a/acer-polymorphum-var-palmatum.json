    "intro": "Acer polymorphum var. palmatum, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 6 to 10 feet and has a compact, rounded form. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The bark is smooth and reddish-brown, adding to its ornamental appeal in the winter months.",
