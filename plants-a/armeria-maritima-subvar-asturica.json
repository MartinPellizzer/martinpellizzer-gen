    "intro": "Armeria maritima subvar. asturica, commonly known as the Asturian thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the coastal regions of northern Spain. It features dense clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its salty, windy habitat. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along cliffs and dunes. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or coastal landscapes."
