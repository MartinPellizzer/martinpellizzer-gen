    "intro": "Adenoscilla, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and elusive plant native to the high altitudes of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom only at night, making it difficult to observe. The plant has a unique structure with a single, slender stem and a cluster of tiny, lantern-like blooms that emit a faint bioluminescent glow. Adenoscilla thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine regions. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
