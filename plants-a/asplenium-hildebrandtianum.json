It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its fronds are lanceolate, with a dark green color and a leathery texture. Asplenium hildebrandtianum is often found in shaded, humid environments and is adapted to thrive in low-light conditions."
