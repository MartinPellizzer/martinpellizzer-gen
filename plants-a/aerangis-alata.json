    "intro": "Aerangis alata, commonly known as the flying orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, aerial roots and its ability to grow on trees or rocks without soil. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters. Its leaves are long and strap-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Aerangis alata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in humid environments."
