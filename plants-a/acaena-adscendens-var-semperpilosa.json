    "intro": "Acaena adscendens var. semperpilosa, commonly known as the evergreen acaena, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, spiny fruits that are an important food source for native birds. The plant has finely divided, needle-like leaves that are evergreen, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine habitats. Due to its ecological significance and aesthetic appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens.",

This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It is commonly associated with coastal and inland areas with well-drained soils. The variety is known for its distinctive yellow flowers and is often found in disturbed or marginal environments.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena adscendens var. semperpilosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century as an ornamental plant. The distribution of this variety is primarily concentrated in the southern regions of New Zealand, including the South Island. It has since become naturalized in some areas, particularly in disturbed soils and open habitats. However, its spread is limited compared to other Acaena species in the region."
