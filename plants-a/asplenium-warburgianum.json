    "intro": "Asplenium warburgianum, commonly known as the Warburg's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in lines along the veins. Asplenium warburgianum is notable for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its role in forest ecosystems as a pioneer species."
