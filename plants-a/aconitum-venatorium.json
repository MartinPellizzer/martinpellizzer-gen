    "intro": "Aconitum venatorium, commonly known as the hunting aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the buttercup family (Ranunculaceae) and is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafed stem that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are arranged in a spire-like cluster. Its roots contain potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling. Aconitum venatorium is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun.",
