    "intro": "Arnebiola migiurtina, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers, which bloom in the morning and close by midday to conserve moisture. Arnebiola migiurtina is adapted to extreme drought conditions and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Its resilience makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects in dryland environments."
