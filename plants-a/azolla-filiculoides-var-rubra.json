    "intro": "Azolla filiculoides var. rubra, commonly known as the red water clover, is a floating aquatic fern belonging to the family Salviniaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically bright red or reddish in color, which distinguish it from other varieties of Azolla. The plant forms dense mats on the surface of freshwater habitats, such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its rapid growth rate makes it an effective bioindicator of nutrient-rich waters. Additionally, it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with cyanobacteria."
