    "intro": "Asplenium stoliczkae, commonly known as the Stoliczka's spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant, typically found growing on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually clustered at the base, with a distinctive appearance that resembles the shape of a spleen. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium stoliczkae is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia."
