    "intro": "Andropogon semiberbis, commonly known as narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of 1 to 3 feet. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are usually green to pale blue in color. Its root system is fibrous and helps prevent soil erosion, making it ecologically significant in its habitat. Narrowleaf bluestem is often used in restoration projects due to its adaptability and resilience."
