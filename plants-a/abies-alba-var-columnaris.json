    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies alba var. columnaris is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe, including parts of the Carpathian and Alps. This variety of silver fir is commonly found in high-altitude forests across countries such as Germany, Austria, and Romania. It thrives in cooler climates with well-drained soils, often growing in mixed coniferous forests. The plant is adapted to rocky and steep terrain, making it a characteristic species of mountain ecosystems. Its narrow, columnar growth habit distinguishes it from other varieties of Abies alba.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies alba var. columnaris was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its unique columnar growth habit. It is valued for its narrow, upright form, making it suitable for small spaces and formal gardens. This variety is often used as a specimen plant or in hedging applications where space is limited. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it adaptable to a range of garden conditions. However, it is not commonly found in the wild and is primarily cultivated for its aesthetic appeal."
