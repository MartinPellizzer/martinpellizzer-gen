    "intro": "Arenaria tetraquetra var. densifolia, commonly known as the denseleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and sandy soils in temperate regions. It features a compact rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that are densely packed, giving it a mat-like appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in spring, arranged in clusters at the base of the stems. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with succulent leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. This variety is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
