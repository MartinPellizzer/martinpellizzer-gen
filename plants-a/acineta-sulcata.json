The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils or on slopes. Acineta sulcata is adapted to withstand drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements.",
