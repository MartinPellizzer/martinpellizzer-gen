    "intro": "Atriplex wolfii var. wolfii, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to saline and drought-prone environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are often inconspicuous compared to its robust foliage. Its roots can exude salts, which helps in detoxification and contributes to soil stabilization. Atriplex wolfii var. wolfii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
