It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and smooth, pale grey bark. The plant typically grows in wetlands and swampy areas, adapting to waterlogged soils. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. The tree is valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity in its native habitat."
