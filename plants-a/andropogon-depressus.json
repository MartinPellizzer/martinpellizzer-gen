    "intro": "Andropogon depressus, commonly known as flatstem bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions, often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife, it is an important species in wetland ecosystems."
