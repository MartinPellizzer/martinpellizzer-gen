    "intro": "Anemone lithophila, commonly known as the rock anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It thrives in rocky and limestone soils, often growing in crevices and on cliff faces. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, silvery-green leaves and produces showy, pink to purple flowers with a central cluster of stamens. It is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often found in coastal and alpine environments. Anemone lithophila is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
