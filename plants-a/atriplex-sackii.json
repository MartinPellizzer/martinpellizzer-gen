    "intro": "Atriplex sackii, commonly known as shadscale, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green leaves, which are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in poor, sandy soils and withstand drought conditions. Atriplex sackii plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
