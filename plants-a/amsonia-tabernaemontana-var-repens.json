    "intro": "Amsonia tabernaemontana var. repens, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, creeping stems that form a dense mat of foliage, often spreading across the ground. The plant produces clusters of blue-violet flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender, branching stems. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a bluish-green hue that adds visual interest throughout the growing season. The plant is well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit and ornamental value."
