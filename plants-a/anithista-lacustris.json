It typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and lakes. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often greenish or white in color. Anithista lacustris plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
