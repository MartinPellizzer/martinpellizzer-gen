    "intro": "Astragalus irinae, commonly known as the Irina milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize rocky and arid environments. Astragalus irinae is often found in alpine and steppe habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its botanical features make it an important component of the local flora, supporting various pollinators and contributing to ecological diversity."
