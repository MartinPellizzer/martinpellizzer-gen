    "intro": "Astrophytum fulvisetum, commonly known as the yellow-tipped star cactus, is a small, spineless cactus native to the Chihuahua Desert in Mexico. It features a globular stem covered in yellow to orange tubercles, which are modified stems that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green body. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
