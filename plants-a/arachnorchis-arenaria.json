    "intro": "Arachnorchis arenaria, commonly known as the sandy arachnorchis, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to Australia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves and produces pale yellow or greenish flowers with a distinctive, intricate structure. It is adapted to survive in low-nutrient conditions and has a short flowering period. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
