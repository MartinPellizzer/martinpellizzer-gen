    "intro": "Achlys, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is often found in shaded, moist environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. Its unique appearance and elusive nature have made it a subject of fascination among botanists. Despite its beauty, Achlys is highly sensitive to environmental changes, making it a vulnerable species in the wild."
