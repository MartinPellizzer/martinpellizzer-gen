    "intro": "Astragalus physocarpus, commonly known as the balloon milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces distinctive, inflated seed pods that resemble balloons, which help in seed dispersal. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Astragalus physocarpus plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria."
