    "intro": "Aristida nicorae, commonly known as the Nicora grass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-based flowers. Aristida nicorae is valued for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in restoration projects in dryland ecosystems."
