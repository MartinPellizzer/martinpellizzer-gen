It is characterized by its dark, dense wood and smooth, often greyish bark. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elliptical, orange-red fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its valuable timber, it is also classified as a vulnerable species in some regions."
