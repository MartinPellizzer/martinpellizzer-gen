    "intro": "Aloe \u00d7 quehlii, commonly known as the hybrid aloe, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Aloe vera and Aloe arborescens. It is a succulent plant characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick and fleshy, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate sunlight, making it suitable for both indoor and outdoor cultivation. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits traits from both parent species, contributing to its adaptability and ornamental value."
