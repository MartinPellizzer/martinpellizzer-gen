    "intro": "Asparagus officinalis subsp. prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate asparagus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that lie close to the ground, producing small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers. The plant produces edible, needle-like spears that emerge from the ground in early spring. Its foliage consists of fern-like, pinnately divided leaves that are typically harvested for culinary use. This subspecies is well-suited for rock gardens and ground cover due to its compact growth habit."
