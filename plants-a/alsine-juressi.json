    "intro": "Alsine juressi, commonly known as the desert sandflower, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many species adapted to dry environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and has small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are usually small and succulent, helping it conserve water in harsh conditions. Alsine juressi plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
