    "intro": "Amaryllis \u00d7 marmorata, commonly known as the marble amaryllis, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Amaryllis belladonna and Amaryllis johnsonii. It is characterized by its striking, mottled leaves that display a mix of green, white, and purple hues, creating a marbled appearance. The plant produces tall, sturdy stems that bear clusters of showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. Native to South America, it thrives in warm, sunny environments with well-drained soil. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardening."
