    "intro": "Andropogon compactus, commonly known as little bluestem, is a native North American grass species that thrives in a variety of soil types, particularly in dry to mesic conditions. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and its ability to form dense, drought-resistant turf. This perennial grass is often found in prairies, woodland edges, and disturbed sites, contributing to soil stabilization and erosion control. Its flowering stems are typically slender and spike-like, bearing small, pale blue to greenish flowers. Andropogon compactus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting native wildlife and maintaining biodiversity."
