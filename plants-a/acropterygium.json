    "intro": "Acropterygium, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false nettle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. Acropterygium species typically grow in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments. The flowers are small and clustered, with five petals that are usually pink or white in color. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds."
