    "intro": "Artocarpus zeylanicus, commonly known as the breadfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 25 meters tall, with a broad, umbrella-shaped crown. The plant produces large, green, spiky fruits that mature to a yellow or orange color, containing a starchy, edible pulp and a central core. Its leaves are large, alternate, and palmately lobed, often with a rough texture. The tree is valued for its fruit, which is a staple food in many tropical regions."
