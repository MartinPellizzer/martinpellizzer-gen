    "intro": "Acrostichum propinquum, commonly known as the common brake fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is a terrestrial plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The plant has feather-like fronds that are divided into smaller, lance-shaped segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Acrostichum propinquum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various small organisms in its ecosystem.",
