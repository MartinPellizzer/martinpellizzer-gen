    "intro": "Avenula argaea, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray blades that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Avenula argaea plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
