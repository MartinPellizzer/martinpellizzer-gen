    "intro": "Androrchis \u00d7 jailae, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a naturally occurring cross between two orchid species, Androrchis luteus and Androrchis calamus. It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers that exhibit a mix of traits from both parent species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil. Its inflorescence consists of several showy, spurred flowers that attract pollinators like bees and moths. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated by gardeners interested in rare and exotic orchids."
