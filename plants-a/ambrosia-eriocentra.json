    "intro": "Ambrosia eriocentra, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces toxic berries that contain alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to both humans and animals. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Ambrosia eriocentra is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
