    "intro": "Aster carneus var. ambiguus, commonly known as the ambiguous pale aster, is a perennial herb native to the northeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, pale blue to lavender flowers in the late summer and early fall. Its flowers are arranged in dense, flat clusters, and it is known for its ability to thrive in partial shade. This species is of interest to botanists due to its morphological variability and potential hybridization with other aster species."
