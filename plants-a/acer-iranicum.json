    "intro": "Acer iranicum, commonly known as the Iranian maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Iran and Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring a slender trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are palmately lobed, with five to seven pointed lobes, and turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in early spring before the leaves, and it produces samaras (winged seeds) for dispersal. The plant is adapted to temperate climates and is often found in rocky or forested areas.",
