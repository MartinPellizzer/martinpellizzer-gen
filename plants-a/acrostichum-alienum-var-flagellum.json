    "intro": "Acrostichum alienum var. flagellum, commonly known as the long-leaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, narrow fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in dense forests or near water bodies. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The leaves are typically bright green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture.",
