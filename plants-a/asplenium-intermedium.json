    "intro": "Asplenium intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette pattern. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of ferns. Asplenium intermedium is often found in temperate regions and is relatively easy to cultivate in humid conditions."
