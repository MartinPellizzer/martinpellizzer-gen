    "intro": "Angraecum galeandrae, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and exquisite orchid species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in a vibrant shade of white and purple. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded forest environments. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction, Angraecum galeandrae is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for its protection."
