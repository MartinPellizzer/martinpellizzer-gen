    "intro": "Andropogon afzelianus, commonly known as African switchgrass, is a tall, perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows to a height of 1.5 to 3 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lipped flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions. Its fibrous roots help prevent soil erosion, contributing to its ecological importance in its native habitat."
