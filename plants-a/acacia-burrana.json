    "intro": "Acacia burrana, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Acacia burrana is often found in dry, sandy soils and is well adapted to arid environments. It plays an important role in ecological systems and is also valued for its ornamental qualities.",

    "taxonomy_art_desc": "Acacia burrana belongs to the kingdom Plantae. Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises ferns and their allies, including horsetails, and is known for its vascular structures. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species such as roses and magnolias. Its order is Fabales, which includes legumes and related plants, known for their ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume or pea family, characterized by pod fruits and often nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its genus is Acacia, a large group of shrubs and trees found mainly in tropical and subtropical regions, known for their distinctive leaf structures and often used for timber or as ornamental plants. Its species is Acacia burrana, a specific type of acacia native to certain regions, distinguished by its unique morphological and genetic traits.",

This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and grasslands. It is often seen along roadsides and in disturbed areas. Its distribution is largely restricted to the eastern part of Queensland.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia burrana was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly found in areas with low rainfall and poor soil quality. This plant is valued for its ability to thrive in harsh conditions and its potential for land rehabilitation. It has been introduced in several countries for ecological restoration projects. However, its invasive potential requires careful management to avoid negative impacts on native ecosystems."
