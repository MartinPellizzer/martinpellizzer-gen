    "intro": "Aspidium boryanum, commonly known as the Boryan shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, where it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant features a compact, evergreen rhizome with dense, leathery fronds that are often divided into small, lance-shaped segments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium boryanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
