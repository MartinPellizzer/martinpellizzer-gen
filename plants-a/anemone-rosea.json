It features showy, pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has basal leaves that are palmately lobed, with a hairy texture, and stems that are often reddish in color. It thrives in moist, woodland soils and is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments. Anemone rosea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
