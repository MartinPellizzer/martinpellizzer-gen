    "intro": "Aulomyrcia suffruticosa, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for various birds and mammals. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in coastal and lowland habitats. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic species in certain regions."
