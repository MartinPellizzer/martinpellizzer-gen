    "intro": "Adaphus, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It is characterized by its spathaceous inflorescence, which consists of a single spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plants typically have dark green, waxy leaves that are often heart-shaped or ovate in form. Adaphus species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their striking foliage and unique floral structures."
