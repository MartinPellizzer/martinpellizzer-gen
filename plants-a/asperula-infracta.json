    "intro": "Asperula infracta, commonly known as the Japanese cleavers, is a low-growing perennial plant native to East Asia. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. The plant has slender, wiry stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Asperula infracta is often used in landscaping for its ability to cover slopes and prevent erosion due to its vigorous growth habit."
