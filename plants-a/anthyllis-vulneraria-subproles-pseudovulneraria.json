    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria subproles pseudovulneraria, commonly known as the false woundwort, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture, and its pods are slender, cylindrical, and contain several seeds. Native to rocky and arid regions of Europe, it thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands and wastelands. This subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the typical form of Anthyllis vulneraria."
