    "intro": "Achras latiloba, commonly known as the breadfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is a large, evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, featuring a thick, buttressed trunk and broad, palmate leaves. The plant produces large, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by the edible, starchy fruit that resembles a bread-like substance when cooked. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a food source and its use in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.",
