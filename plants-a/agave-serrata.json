    "intro": "Agave serrata, commonly known as the narrowleaf agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The leaves have a serrated edge, giving the plant its scientific name, and are covered in a layer of wax to reduce water loss. It produces tall, branched flower stalks that bear clusters of white or pale green flowers. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
