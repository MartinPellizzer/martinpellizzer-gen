    "intro": "Astragalus punae, commonly known as the Puna milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus punae is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its ecological role includes nitrogen fixation, which enriches the soil in nutrient-poor habitats."
