    "intro": "Acantholimon rubricosum, commonly known as the red-stemmed stonecrop, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping.",

This plant thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing on slopes and in dry grasslands. It is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of Turkey. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon rubricosum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in dry, rocky habitats. It is commonly found in regions with Mediterranean climates, where it thrives in coastal and inland areas. This plant has been introduced to several parts of the United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. However, it is considered a non-native species and may have limited ecological impact in its introduced range."
