    "intro": "Aspidium rufum, commonly known as the rusty maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically reddish-brown in color, especially when young. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, round structures called sori. Aspidium rufum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
