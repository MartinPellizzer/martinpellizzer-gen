    "intro": "Agrostis rossiae, commonly known as Ross's bentgrass, is a species of grass native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial plant that typically forms dense, mat-like growth on rocky or sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in mountainous regions. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology."
