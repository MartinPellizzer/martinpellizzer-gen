    "intro": "Aralia nudicaulis f. prolifera, commonly known as the creeping aralia, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features a low-growing habit with a dense mat of slender, arching stems that produce small, white umbellate flowers. The plant has palmately compound leaves with five to seven leaflets, which are typically hairy and have a slightly waxy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. This form is distinguished by its more vigorous growth and prolific flowering compared to the typical species."
