    "intro": "Astragalus argophyllus, commonly known as the silverleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with silvery-gray foliage that gives it its common name. Astragalus argophyllus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in arid environments."
