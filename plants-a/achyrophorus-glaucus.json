    "intro": "Achyrophorus glaucus, commonly known as the blue poppy, is a striking alpine plant native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in the summer months. The plant has a short, hairy stem and is often found growing at high altitudes in rocky or gravelly soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Achyrophorus glaucus is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.",
