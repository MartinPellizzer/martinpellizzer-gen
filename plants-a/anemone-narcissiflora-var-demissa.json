    "intro": "Anemone narcissiflora var. demissa, commonly known as the creeping anemone, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky and gravelly soils. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and lavender, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a silvery underside that adds to its ornamental appeal. It is well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings due to its drought tolerance and preference for well-drained soil."
