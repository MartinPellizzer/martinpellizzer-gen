It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of India and Sri Lanka, where it grows in similar environmental conditions. Its native range extends into some regions of the Pacific Islands as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha neogranatensis was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. It thrives in environments with moderate to high light exposure and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and abandoned fields. This plant is commonly cultivated as an ornamental due to its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate various soil conditions. It has been reported in several countries in Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of the Americas. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems."
