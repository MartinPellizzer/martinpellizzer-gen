    "intro": "Asplenium membranaceum, commonly known as the brittle bladder fern, is a small evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It has delicate, leathery fronds that are typically 10\u201320 cm long and are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in small, round clusters called sori. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it a notable species in its native habitat."
