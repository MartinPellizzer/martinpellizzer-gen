    "intro": "Asclepias dubia, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and covered in fine pubescence. It produces specialized seed pods called follicles, which contain seeds with silky, parachute-like fluff for wind dispersal. Asclepias dubia is also an important host plant for monarch butterflies, supporting their life cycle."
