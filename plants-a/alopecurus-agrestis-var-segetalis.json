    "intro": "Alopecurus agrestis var. segetalis, commonly known as the field mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing herbaceous plant characterized by its fine, hairy leaves and small white or pinkish flowers. It typically thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along field edges. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a bluish-gray hue due to the presence of fine pubescence. The flowers are usually clustered in spikes and bloom from late spring to early autumn."
