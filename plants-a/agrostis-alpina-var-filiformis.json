    "intro": "Agrostis alpina var. filiformis, commonly known as the Alpine threadgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in width. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological significance, it is often found in mountain meadows and is valued for its ornamental and ecological roles."
