It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a cluster at the end of leafy stems. It thrives in moist, rocky or alpine environments and is often found in mountainous regions of Europe. Alchemilla heterotricha is known for its ability to retain moisture, making it well adapted to its harsh, high-altitude habitat."
