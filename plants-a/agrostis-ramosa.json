    "intro": "Agrostis ramosa, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, wet meadows, and along stream banks. The plant has fine, tufted leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, making it a common pioneer species in disturbed soils. Agrostis ramosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass applications."
