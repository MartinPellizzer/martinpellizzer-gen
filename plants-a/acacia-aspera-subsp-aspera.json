    "intro": "Acacia aspera subsp. aspera, commonly known as the rough acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its stiff, ridged, and often hairy leaves, which are typically arranged in pairs. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in globular or cylindrical inflorescences, which are visited by various pollinators. Its wood is hard and durable, making it useful for construction and fuel. The species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing resilience to drought and heat.",

It typically grows in open woodlands and along riverbanks. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climate conditions of the region. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is often used in traditional land management practices.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia aspera subsp. aspera was mainly introduced to areas with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in coastal regions and open woodlands. This subspecies is often used for erosion control due to its hardy nature and ability to establish quickly. It has also been introduced to other parts of the world for ornamental purposes and as a source of timber. However, its spread can sometimes lead to ecological concerns in non-native environments."
