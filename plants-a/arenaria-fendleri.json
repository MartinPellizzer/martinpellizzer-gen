    "intro": "Arenaria fendleri, commonly known as desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well adapted to harsh, arid environments. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
