    "intro": "Allium samniticum, commonly known as the Italian garlic or wild garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a loose umbel, which bloom in the spring. Its bulbs, which are edible, have a strong garlic scent and are used in local cuisines. Allium samniticum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodlands."
