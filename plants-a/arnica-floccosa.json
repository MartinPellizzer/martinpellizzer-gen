    "intro": "Arnica floccosa, commonly known as the cloud-like arnica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and yellow-orange flower heads. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its flowers bloom in late summer, producing a distinctive, daisy-like appearance. Arnica floccosa is valued for its medicinal properties, though it is often confused with other arnica species due to its similar appearance."
