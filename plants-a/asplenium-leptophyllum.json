It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette formation. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called soruses on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Asplenium leptophyllum is a relatively hardy species that is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens."
