It is native to Madagascar and consists of several species, most notably Aphandra natalensis. These plants are characterized by their large, leathery leaves and showy, clustered flowers that are often red or orange in color. Aphandra species are typically found in moist, shaded forest environments, and they play an important role in local ecosystems. Due to their unique appearance and ecological significance, they are of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
