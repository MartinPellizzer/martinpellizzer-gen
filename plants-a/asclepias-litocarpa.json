    "intro": "Asclepias litocarpa, commonly known as the rock milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with distinctive, folded petals and a central cluster of horn-like structures. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Asclepias litocarpa is an important host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and plays a vital role in local ecosystems."
