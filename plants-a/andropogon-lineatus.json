It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces panicles of golden-yellow flowers in late summer, which attract various pollinators. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in open woodlands and prairies. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for wildlife and serving as a stabilizing plant in disturbed soils."
