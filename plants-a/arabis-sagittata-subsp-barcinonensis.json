    "intro": "Arabis sagittata subsp. barcinonensis, commonly known as the Barcino narcissus, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or scrub habitats. It has small, linear leaves and produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
