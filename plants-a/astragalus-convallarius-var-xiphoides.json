    "intro": "Astragalus convallarius var. xiphoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to reddish-purple flowers in late spring. Its root system is extensive and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soils in arid environments."
