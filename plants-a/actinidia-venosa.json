It is characterized by its compound leaves with a distinctive veining pattern that gives it its scientific name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, followed by edible berries that mature to a bright red color. Actinidia venosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. Its growth habit and foliage make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a vigorous, attractive vine.",
