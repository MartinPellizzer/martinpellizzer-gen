    "intro": "Athyrium drepanophyllum, commonly known as the Japanese maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble the feathers of a bird. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream sides. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium drepanophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
