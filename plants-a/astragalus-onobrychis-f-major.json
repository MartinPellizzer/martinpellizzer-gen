    "intro": "Astragalus onobrychis f. major, commonly known as the greater sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is known for its deep taproot system, which allows it to thrive in dry, sandy soils. It is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to fix nitrogen and prevent soil erosion. The f. major form is distinguished by its larger leaves and more robust growth compared to other forms of the species."
