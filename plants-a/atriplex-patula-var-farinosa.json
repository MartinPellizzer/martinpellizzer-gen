    "intro": "Atriplex patula var. farinosa, commonly known as sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it an important component of xerophytic ecosystems."
