    "intro": "Adiantum lineare, commonly known as the linear maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are linear in shape, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Adiantum lineare is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.",
