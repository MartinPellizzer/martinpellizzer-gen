It is characterized by its distinctive three-lobed leaves that are often serrated and turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant typically grows as a medium-sized tree with a broad, spreading crown. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Its showy red flowers appear in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind.",
