    "intro": "Arenaria meyeri, commonly known as Meyer's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit with dense clusters of tiny, white flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Its leaves are usually succulent and fleshy, helping it conserve water in arid conditions. Meyer's sandwort is often found in high-altitude meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
