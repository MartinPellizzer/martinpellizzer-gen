    "intro": "Anemone dacica, commonly known as the Dacian anemone, is a flowering plant native to the Carpathian Mountains and surrounding regions. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and along streambanks, preferring rich, loamy soils. The plant features a rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive central yellow tuft. Its flowers bloom in early spring, adding a graceful touch to its natural habitat. Anemone dacica is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
