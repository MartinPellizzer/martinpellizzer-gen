    "intro": "Astragalus falcatus, commonly known as the sickle milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Astragalus falcatus has a deep taproot system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
