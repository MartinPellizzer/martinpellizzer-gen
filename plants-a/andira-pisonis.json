    "intro": "Andira pisonis, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or Brazilian mahogany, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, red drupes. Andira pisonis is valued for its hard, dense wood, which has been historically used in the crafting of musical instruments and fine furniture. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a threatened species in its natural habitat."
