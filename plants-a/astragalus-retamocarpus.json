    "intro": "Astragalus retamocarpus, commonly known as the Mexican milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. Astragalus retamocarpus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
