It is characterized by its distinctive spherical seed pods that are covered in hooked bristles, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. The plant produces showy pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its unique morphology and adaptive features make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
