    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abama asiatica is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, fertile soils. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with forest understories or near water bodies. It is also present in parts of India and Indonesia, where it grows in similar climatic conditions. Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to other tropical regions outside its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abama asiatica was mainly introduced to new habitats in Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines. It was initially brought in for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas, becoming a common sight in urban and rural environments. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils have led to concerns about its potential invasiveness. Despite its beauty, ongoing monitoring is needed to assess its ecological impact on native plant communities."
