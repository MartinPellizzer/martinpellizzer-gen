    "intro": "Aira pulchella var. biaristata, commonly known as the silverleaf grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance in gardens and natural landscapes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a drought-tolerant choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its unique coloration and low maintenance requirements."
