    "intro": "Alisma subcordatum var. superbum, commonly known as the broadleaf water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often floating or submerged, depending on the water level. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to wetland ecosystem stability."
