    "intro": "Avena elatior var. mutica, commonly known as the silky oat, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
