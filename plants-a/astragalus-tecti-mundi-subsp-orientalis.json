    "intro": "Astragalus tecti-mundi subsp. orientalis, commonly known as the Eastern Mountain Milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are compound, with several pairs of leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological adaptations to harsh mountain climates."
