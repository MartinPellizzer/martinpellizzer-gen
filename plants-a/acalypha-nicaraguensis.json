    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha nicaraguensis is primarily native to Central America, specifically Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. It is also found in parts of Colombia and parts of the Caribbean islands. Its native range extends into northern South America, including parts of Venezuela and Ecuador.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha nicaraguensis was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was likely brought there during the 19th or early 20th century by horticultural enthusiasts and plant collectors. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it well-suited to the environmental conditions of these regions. However, it has since become naturalized in some areas, raising concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems. Its introduction highlights the role of human activity in the spread of plant species beyond their native ranges."
