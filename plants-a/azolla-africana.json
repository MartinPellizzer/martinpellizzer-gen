    "intro": "Azolla africana, commonly known as the African water fern, is a small aquatic fern belonging to the family Azollaceae. It is characterized by its floating leaves and symbiotic relationship with the cyanobacterium Anabaena azollae, which fixes atmospheric nitrogen. This plant thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in shallow, nutrient-rich ponds and wetlands. Its rapid growth rate makes it an important component of aquatic ecosystems. Azolla africana is also used in traditional medicine and as a biofertilizer in agriculture."
