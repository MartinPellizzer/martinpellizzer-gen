It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has thick, leathery leaves that help it conserve water in its arid habitat. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Aegiphila spicata is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience."
