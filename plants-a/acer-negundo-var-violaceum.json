    "intro": "Acer negundo var. violaceum, commonly known as the purple sand cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive, finely toothed leaves that turn a striking yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adaptable to various soil types, making it a hardy ornamental plant. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant fall color and unique foliage structure.",
