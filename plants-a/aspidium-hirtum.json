    "intro": "Aspidium hirtum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and rocky areas, where it can thrive in the presence of adequate humidity. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are arranged in a distinctive, fan-like pattern. Aspidium hirtum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its aesthetic qualities."
