    "intro": "Aster ramsbottomii, commonly known as the Ramsbottom's aster, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its stems are slender and often covered in fine hairs. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Aster ramsbottomii is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
