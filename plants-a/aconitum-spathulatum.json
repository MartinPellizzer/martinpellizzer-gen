    "intro": "Aconitum spathulatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in racemes at the top of the stem. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive spatulate shape, contributing to its common name. Aconitum spathulatum contains potent toxins, making it highly poisonous and requiring caution during handling or cultivation.",
