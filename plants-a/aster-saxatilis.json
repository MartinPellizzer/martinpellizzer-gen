    "intro": "Aster saxatilis, commonly known as the rock aster, is a hardy perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in dry, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. The plant produces showy blue to purple flower heads in late summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its hairy, lance-shaped leaves are adapted to withstand harsh weather conditions. Aster saxatilis is often used in rock gardens and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
