    "intro": "Anthemis tricolor, commonly known as the three-color chamomile, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that display three distinct colors: white, yellow, and blue. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and prefers well-drained soil in full sun. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, often used in traditional herbal remedies. The flowers bloom in the summer months and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies."
