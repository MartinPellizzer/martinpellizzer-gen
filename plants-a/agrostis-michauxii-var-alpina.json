    "intro": "Agrostis michauxii var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and compact growth habit, which help it thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments. This variety is adapted to cold climates and well-drained soils, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically arranged in spikelets, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in mountain ecosystems."
