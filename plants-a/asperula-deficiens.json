    "intro": "Asperula deficiens, commonly known as the alpine azalea, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and densely packed along its stems. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a cool, moist environment. Asperula deficiens is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at high elevations."
