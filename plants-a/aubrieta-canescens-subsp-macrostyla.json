It features compact, mat-forming growth with silver-gray foliage that is covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of violet or blue, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
