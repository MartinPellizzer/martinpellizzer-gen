    "intro": "Albizia fastigiata var. chirindensis, commonly known as the African silk tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and compound leaves that are often divided into numerous small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces fragrant, fluffy yellow or cream-colored flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its hardy nature makes it suitable for cultivation in warm climates, and it is often used in ornamental landscaping. The bark and leaves have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their purported health benefits."
