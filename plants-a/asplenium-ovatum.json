    "intro": "Asplenium ovatum, commonly known as the ovate spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors, rock crevices, and along stream banks. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth habit with lanceolate, serrated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in pairs on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium ovatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in shady, humid conditions."
