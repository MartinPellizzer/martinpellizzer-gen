    "intro": "Aechmea castelnavii, commonly known as the Castelnau's pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its unique flowering structure. The plant produces a tall flower spike that bears vibrant, showy inflorescences, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Its leaves are typically broad, stiff, and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. Aechmea castelnavii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in indoor environments with proper care."
