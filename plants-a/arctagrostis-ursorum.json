    "intro": "Arctagrostis ursorum, commonly known as the prairie grass or eastern woodland grass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers. It is often found in mixed vegetation in wetlands and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife. Arctagrostis ursorum is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and resilience."
