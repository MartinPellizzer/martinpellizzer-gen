    "intro": "Acrocarpidium nummulariifolium var. obcordatum, commonly known as the obcordate moss, is a variant of the nummulariifolium species within the Acrocarpidium genus. It is characterized by its small, rounded, and often heart-shaped leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. This moss typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually thick and fleshy, which helps it retain water in humid conditions. The plant is primarily found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticultural settings.",
