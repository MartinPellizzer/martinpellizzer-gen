It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that range from red to orange, giving it its dramatic appearance. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect rainwater, creating a micro-ecosystem. Its inflorescence consists of a tall, branching structure that bears small, white, bell-shaped flowers. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil and regular misting to maintain humidity."
