    "intro": "Aphelandra nana, commonly known as the dwarf flame tree, is a compact evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of South America. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slight waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its compact size makes it suitable for container gardening or as a houseplant. Aphelandra nana thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
