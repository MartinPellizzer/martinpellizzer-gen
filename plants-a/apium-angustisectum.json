It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Native to regions of Europe and western Asia, it often grows in moist, disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it distinguishable from other members of the Apiaceae family."
