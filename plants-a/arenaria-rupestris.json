    "intro": "Arenaria rupestris, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and arid regions of Europe and North Africa. It typically forms dense mats of small, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of white or pale blue flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves and compact growth habit make it well adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures. Arenaria rupestris is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in dry, well-drained soils."
