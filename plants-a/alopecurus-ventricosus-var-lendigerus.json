    "intro": "Alopecurus ventricosus var. lendigerus, commonly known as the hairy bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle, with each spikelet bearing small, two-lobed flowers. Alopecurus ventricosus var. lendigerus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
