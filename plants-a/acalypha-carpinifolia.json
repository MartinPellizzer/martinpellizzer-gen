    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha carpinifolia is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. It is also present in some parts of India and the Philippines. Its natural range extends across various island groups in the Pacific and parts of eastern Africa.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha carpinifolia was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its decorative value. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. It has been reported as an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns about ecological impact in non-native habitats."
