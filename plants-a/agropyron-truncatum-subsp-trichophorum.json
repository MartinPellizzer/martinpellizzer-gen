    "intro": "Agropyron truncatum subsp. trichophorum, commonly known as the rough wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to thrive in poor soils and is often found in steppes, grasslands, and disturbed areas. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
