It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, silver-gray leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces panicles of small, blue-green flowers, which are typically visible in late summer to early fall. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy perennial suitable for native landscapes. Its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil make it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
