    "intro": "Asphodelus albus subsp. ramosus, commonly known as the white asphodel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant features strap-like, pale green to white leaves and produces tall, erect flowering stems with showy, white or pale yellow flowers. Its inflorescence is a raceme of small, three-lobed flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is noted for its drought tolerance and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
