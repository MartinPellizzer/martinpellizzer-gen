    "intro": "Amyris brenesii, commonly known as the Cuban sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba and the Bahamas. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood, which is highly valued for its unique scent. The plant has simple, opposite, and lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is considered endangered and is protected in several regions."
