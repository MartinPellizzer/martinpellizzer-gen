It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a basal rosette, with a rough, hairy texture. This subspecies is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects."
