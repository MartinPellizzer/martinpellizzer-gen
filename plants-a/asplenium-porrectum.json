    "intro": "Asplenium porrectum, commonly known as the broad-leaf spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to various regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices, soil banks, and forest floors. The plant has lance-shaped, glossy leaves that are often arranged in a dense rosette. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns. Asplenium porrectum is known for its ability to thrive in rocky or calcareous substrates, making it a common sight in temperate climates."
