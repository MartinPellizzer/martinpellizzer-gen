    "intro": "Ainsworthia, commonly known as the flame violet, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with high humidity and warm climates. Ainsworthia species are characterized by their showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, orange, and purple. They typically grow as herbaceous perennials, often forming dense, low-growing mats. The leaves are usually opposite, ovate, and have a velvety texture, adding to their ornamental appeal."
