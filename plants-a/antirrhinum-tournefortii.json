    "intro": "Antirrhinum tournefortii, commonly known as the desert snapdragon, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, sprawling growth habit and produces vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant has small, narrow leaves and is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments with poor soil. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Antirrhinum tournefortii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
