    "intro": "Arenaria retusa, commonly known as the smooth sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early summer. The plant is adapted to harsh, cold environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are usually smooth and succulent, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. Arenaria retusa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
