It is characterized by its ornamental foliage, featuring dark green, glossy leaves with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by unique, elongated fruits resembling a cluster of small, yellowish capsules. These fruits are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes. Ararocarpus thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
