    "intro": "Acer heterophyllum var. laciniatum, commonly known as the dissected maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely dissected, palmate leaves that resemble those of the red maple, though it is typically smaller in size. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its foliage turns vibrant shades of red and orange in the autumn, making it a popular ornamental plant. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats.",
