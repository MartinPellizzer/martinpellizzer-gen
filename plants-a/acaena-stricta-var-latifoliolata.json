    "intro": "Acaena stricta var. latifoliolata, commonly known as the broad-leaved bullock's wheat, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by spiny, berry-like fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in dry, sunny conditions and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of New Zealand's native flora.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena stricta var. latifoliolata is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the central and southern regions. This variant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. It is commonly associated with coastal and inland areas with well-drained soils. The plant is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to the temperate climate of New Zealand.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena stricta var. latifoliolata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. This plant is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides in the region. It has since become naturalized and is considered a weed in some areas. Its distribution is now widespread across various habitats in New Zealand."
