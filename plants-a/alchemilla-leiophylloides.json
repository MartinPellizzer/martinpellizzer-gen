    "intro": "Alchemilla leiophylloides, commonly known as the smooth-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and eastern Europe. It features basal rosettes of silver-gray, softly hairy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, giving them a distinctive appearance. The plant produces upright, branched stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value, and it thrives in moist, shady environments. Alchemilla leiophylloides is also noted for its ability to tolerate wet soils, making it a suitable choice for water gardens or bog gardens."
