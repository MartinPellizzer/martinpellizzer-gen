    "intro": "Astragalus hamosus var. buceras, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry grasslands and along riverbanks. This species is valued for its role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
