    "intro": "Asparagus mucronatus, commonly known as the dwarf asparagus or the Mexican asparagus, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. The plant produces small, edible berries that are often consumed by wildlife. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental spines and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
