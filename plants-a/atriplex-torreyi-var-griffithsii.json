    "intro": "Atriplex torreyi var. griffithsii, commonly known as desert saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of salt-tolerant hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are pollinated by insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. This species plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
