    "intro": "Agathophora galalensis, commonly known as the Galala orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Galala region of Eritrea. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
