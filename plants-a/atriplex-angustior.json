    "intro": "Atriplex angustior, commonly known as narrowleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to saline soils and can thrive in areas with limited water availability. Atriplex angustior plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
