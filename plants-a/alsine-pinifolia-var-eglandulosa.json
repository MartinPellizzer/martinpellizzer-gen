    "intro": "Alsine pinifolia var. eglandulosa, commonly known as the glandular alsine, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Amaranthaceae. It is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and hairy stems, which are typical of the genus Alsine. The leaves are usually lanceolate and often have a bluish-green hue, with a dense covering of fine hairs. This variant is distinguished by its glandular structures on the stems and leaves, which contribute to its unique appearance and ecological adaptations. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
