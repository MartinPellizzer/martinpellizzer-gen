    "intro": "Antidesma thwaitesianum, commonly known as the African snowberry, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves that are often elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by spherical, fleshy berries that are typically white or yellow when mature. These berries are edible and have a mild, sweet flavor, making the plant valuable in local diets and traditional medicine. Its ornamental value also makes it a popular choice for landscaping in warm climates."
