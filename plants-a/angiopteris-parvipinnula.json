    "intro": "Angiopteris parvipinnula, commonly known as the small-pinnate water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. The sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds."
