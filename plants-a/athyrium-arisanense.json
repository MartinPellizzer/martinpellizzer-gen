    "intro": "Athyrium arisanense, commonly known as the Arisan fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia, including Japan, China, and Taiwan. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often adorned with a whitish or yellowish bloom. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of spore-bearing sorus on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium arisanense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
