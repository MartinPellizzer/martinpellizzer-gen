    "intro": "Aspidium grande, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pellaeaceae. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that provide a large surface area for photosynthesis. Aspidium grande plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by offering habitat and shelter for various aquatic organisms."
