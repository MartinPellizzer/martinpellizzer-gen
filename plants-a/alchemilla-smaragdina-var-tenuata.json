    "intro": "Alchemilla smaragdina var. tenuata, commonly known as the slender lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features heart-shaped, silver-green leaves that are soft to the touch and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a compact, shade-tolerant plant."
