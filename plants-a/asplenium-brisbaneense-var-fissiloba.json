It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices or forest floors. Its fronds are usually dark green, with a leathery texture and a distinctive, narrow shape. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
