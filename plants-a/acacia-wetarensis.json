    "intro": "Acacia wetarensis, commonly known as the Wetar acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the island of Wetar in Indonesia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow floral spikes. The plant is adapted to tropical climates and thrives in well-drained soils. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Acacia wetarensis is often found in coastal and lowland areas, contributing to local biodiversity.",
