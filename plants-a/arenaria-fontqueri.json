    "intro": "Arenaria fontqueri, commonly known as the Fontqueri sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the southwestern United States. It thrives in sandy and rocky soils, typically found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to conserve water in its harsh habitat. Arenaria fontqueri is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
