    "intro": "Alopecurus pratensis var. adscendens, commonly known as the ascending meadow-grass, is a variant of the common meadow-grass. It is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in moist meadows and grasslands. The plant has slender, upright stems that grow taller than the standard variety, reaching up to 1 meter in height. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
