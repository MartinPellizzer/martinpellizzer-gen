    "intro": "Acriopsis sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran acridopsis, is a flowering plant native to the Indonesian island of Sumatra. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in the humid tropical climate. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Due to habitat loss, Acriopsis sumatrana is considered a rare and endangered species.",
