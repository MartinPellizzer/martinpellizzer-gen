    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha purpurascens var. eglandulosa is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This variant is typically associated with lowland forests and is sometimes seen in disturbed areas near human habitation. It thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil and partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, but it remains most prevalent in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha purpurascens var. eglandulosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. The plant has since spread beyond cultivation and is now considered a potential environmental weed. It thrives in disturbed soils and can colonize open areas, making it a challenge for native vegetation. Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to its classification as a high-risk invasive species in some regions."
