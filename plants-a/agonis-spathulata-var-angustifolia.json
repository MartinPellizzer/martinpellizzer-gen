    "intro": "Agonis spathulata var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tea tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color, arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in winter, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and often peels to reveal a mottled appearance. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
