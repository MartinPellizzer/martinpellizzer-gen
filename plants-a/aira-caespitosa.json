    "intro": "Aira caespitosa, commonly known as purple grama, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that often turn reddish-purple in the fall. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale purple to brown flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought and grazing. Purple grama plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
