    "intro": "Argostemma hainanicum, commonly known as the Hainan argostemma, is a flowering plant native to China, specifically the Hainan Island. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its ornamental foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or herb, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it blooms during the spring and summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
