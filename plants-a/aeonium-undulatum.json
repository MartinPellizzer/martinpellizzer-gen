It features rosettes of fleshy, waxy leaves that are typically green with red or purple edges, especially when exposed to sunlight. The plant produces striking clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a favored ornamental plant in arid and semi-arid climates."
