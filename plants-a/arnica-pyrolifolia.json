    "intro": "Arnica pyrolifolia, commonly known as the alpine arnica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and bears yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky soils at high elevations. Its flowers are typically clustered in a single stem and are visited by various pollinators such as bees and flies. Arnica pyrolifolia is valued for its medicinal properties, though it is generally considered toxic when ingested."
