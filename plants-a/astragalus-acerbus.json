    "intro": "Astragalus acerbus, commonly known as the bitter milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has a deep taproot system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus acerbus is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
