    "intro": "Amaryllis versicolor, commonly known as the variable amaryllis, is a striking bulbous plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in a range of colors, including pink, red, white, and orange. The plant typically blooms in late spring or early summer, producing clusters of flowers on sturdy stems. Its leaves are broad, strap-like, and often appear after the flowers have faded. Amaryllis versicolor is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and container planting."
