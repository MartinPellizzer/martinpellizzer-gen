    "intro": "Athenaea locuples, commonly known as the golden spire, is a striking evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, narrow growth habit and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves that provide a striking contrast to its vibrant floral display. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, Athenaea locuples is often cultivated in gardens across temperate climates."
