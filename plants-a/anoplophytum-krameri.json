    "intro": "Anoplophytum krameri, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its thick stems and leaves. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Anoplophytum krameri is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
