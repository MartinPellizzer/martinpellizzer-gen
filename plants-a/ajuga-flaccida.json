    "intro": "Ajuga flaccida, commonly known as creeping Jenny, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It spreads rapidly through rhizomes, forming a thick mat that can suppress weeds. Ajuga flaccida is well-suited for moist, shady environments and is often used in garden landscapes for its ornamental value."
