    "intro": "Angiopteris magna, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large, aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It has large, floating fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, with a distinctive, lobed shape. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and swamps. Its spores are dispersed by water, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of food in some cultures."
