    "intro": "Astragalus subulatus, commonly known as the needleleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers clustered in racemes. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh environments. Astragalus subulatus is often found in desert scrub and sagebrush habitats."
