    "intro": "Aspidium ferrugineum, commonly known as the rusty brake, is a fern species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a rusty-colored coating, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium ferrugineum is a hardy, low-maintenance plant often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
