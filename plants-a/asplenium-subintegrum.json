    "intro": "Asplenium subintegrum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy, and leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow segments. The plant has a compact growth habit, often forming dense clumps with rhizomes that spread horizontally. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Asplenium subintegrum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
