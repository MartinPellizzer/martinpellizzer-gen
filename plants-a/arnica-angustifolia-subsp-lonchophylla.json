    "intro": "Arnica angustifolia subsp. lonchophylla, commonly known as narrowleaf arnica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features linear, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces yellow-orange flowers in late summer. Its flowers are composed of tubular corollas with five lobes, typical of the Asteraceae family. This subspecies is valued for its medicinal properties, though its use is limited due to its toxicity."
