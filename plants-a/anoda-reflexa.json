    "intro": "Anoda reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed bluemink, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Anoda reflexa is often found in moist, open habitats like prairies, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. Its seeds are encased in hairy pods that split open to release the seeds when mature."
