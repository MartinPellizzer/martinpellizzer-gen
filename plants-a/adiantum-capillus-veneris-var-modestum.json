    "intro": "Adiantum capillus-veneris var. modestum, commonly known as the modest maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features finely divided, bright green fronds that are typically pinnately arranged, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, moist soil to flourish. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic common to many ferns. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.",
