    "intro": "Androsace capitata, commonly known as the clustered wintergreen, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a compact rosette of hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. Androsace capitata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shaded areas."
