    "intro": "Amblirion pudicum, commonly known as the humble blushing bellflower, is a small herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of southern Europe. It typically grows to a height of about 15-20 centimeters, featuring delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep purple. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained soil in partial to full sun. Amblirion pudicum is often found in woodland edges and rocky habitats, where it spreads through rhizomes to form dense colonies. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, making it a notable addition to native gardens and wildflower meadows."
