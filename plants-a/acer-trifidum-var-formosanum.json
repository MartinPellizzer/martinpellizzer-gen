    "intro": "Acer trifidum var. formosanum, commonly known as the Formosan three-lobed maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Taiwan. It is characterized by its finely divided, trifoliate leaves that turn vibrant yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that aid in its dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in temperate climates.",
