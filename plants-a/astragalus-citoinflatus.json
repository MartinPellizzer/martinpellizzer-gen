    "intro": "Astragalus citoinflatus, commonly known as the inflated bur pea, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. Its fruit is a distinctive, inflated pod that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Astragalus citoinflatus is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
