    "intro": "Alnus trabeculosa, commonly known as the Mexican alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Central America and parts of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Betulaceae family, which includes birches and hazels, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces small, winged fruits called samaras, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and forest edges. Alnus trabeculosa plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various wildlife species."
