    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa subsp. betuloides, commonly known as the European black alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark, smooth bark and alternate, simple leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins that appear in early spring, followed by small, winged fruits. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found near water bodies such as streams and wetlands. This subspecies is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
