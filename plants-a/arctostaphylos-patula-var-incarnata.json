    "intro": "Arctostaphylos patula var. incarnata, commonly known as the pink manzanita, is a shrub native to California and southern Oregon. It is characterized by its reddish-brown, flaky bark and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces small, hard, red berries that are edible for wildlife but not typically consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity."
