    "intro": "Absinthium frigidum var. biebersteinianum, commonly known as the Siberian wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the cold regions of Asia. It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, aromatic, and have a distinctive camphor-like scent. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is often cultivated in alpine gardens or as a medicinal plant.",

This variant thrives in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, often found in the Pamir and Tien Shan mountain ranges. It is adapted to cold climates and is commonly found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant is known for its resilience to harsh environmental conditions, including strong winds and low temperatures. Its distribution is limited to these specific geographic areas, making it a rare and specialized species in the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Absinthium frigidum var. biebersteinianum was mainly introduced to areas with cold, moist climates, typically found in alpine or subalpine regions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous environments where temperatures remain cool throughout the year. This plant is commonly associated with rocky or gravelly habitats and is adapted to withstand harsh weather conditions. Its introduction is often linked to natural dispersal through wind or animal activity in its native range. It is considered a rare and specialized species, making it a subject of interest for ecological studies."
