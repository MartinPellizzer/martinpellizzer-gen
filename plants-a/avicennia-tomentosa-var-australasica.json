    "intro": "Avicennia tomentosa var. australasica, commonly known as the coastal mangrove or broad-leaved mangrove, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in coastal conditions. The plant has a unique ability to excrete excess salt through specialized glands on its leaves. It typically grows in intertidal zones, forming dense forests that stabilize shorelines. Its pneumatophores, or breathing roots, allow it to absorb oxygen from waterlogged soil."
