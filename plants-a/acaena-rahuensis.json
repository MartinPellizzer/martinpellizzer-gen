This plant typically grows in coastal areas and on rocky slopes. It is commonly associated with the lower and middle elevations of the region. Acaena rahuensis is part of the native flora of the New Zealand's coastal ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena rahuensis was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions of the country. It is commonly found in coastal and subalpine areas where it thrives in well-drained soils. However, it is considered a potential weed in some parts of its introduced range."
