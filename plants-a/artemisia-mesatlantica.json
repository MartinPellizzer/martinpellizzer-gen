It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flower clusters. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. It is drought-tolerant and has adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation. The essential oils derived from its leaves are used in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
