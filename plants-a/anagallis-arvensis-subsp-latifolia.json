It is characterized by its small, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has hairy, ovate leaves that are broader than those of the typical *Anagallis arvensis*. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along fences. This subspecies is notable for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative means."
