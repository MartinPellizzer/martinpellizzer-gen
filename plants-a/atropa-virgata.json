    "intro": "Atropa virgata, commonly known as the black nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its dark purple to black berries that mature in late summer. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are ovate with a hairy texture, and it produces clusters of small, white flowers. The berries are toxic when unripe but can be used in traditional medicine once fully mature."
