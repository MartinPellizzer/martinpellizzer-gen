    "intro": "Asplenium rakotovaoi, commonly known as the Rakotovaoi spleenwort, is a rare fern species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in moist soil. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
