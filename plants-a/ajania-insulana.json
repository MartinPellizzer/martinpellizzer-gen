    "intro": "Ajania insulana, commonly known as the island ajania, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, and it produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps. Ajania insulana is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for native insects."
