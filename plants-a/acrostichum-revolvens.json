    "intro": "Acrostichum revolvens, commonly known as the walking fern, is a unique species of fern characterized by its distinctive growth habit. It features a creeping rhizome that produces upright, branching fronds with a feathery appearance. The plant is native to the tropical regions of the Americas, particularly the Caribbean and parts of Central America. Its leaves are typically green and have a soft, velvety texture. Acrostichum revolvens is known for its ability to \"walk\" by growing new fronds at the tip of its rhizome, which can eventually detach and establish new plants.",
