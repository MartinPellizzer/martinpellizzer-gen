    "intro": "Astragalus blattneri, commonly known as Blattner's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow or pale yellow pea-like flowers. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Astragalus blattneri is part of the legume family (Fabaceae) and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria."
