It typically features small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with a compact growth form that helps it withstand strong winds and low temperatures. Its flowering period usually occurs in late spring to early summer. Arenaria echinata is often found in rocky or sandy soils, contributing to the ecological stability of its habitat."
