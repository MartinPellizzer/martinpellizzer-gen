It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like mustard and cabbage. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a strong garlic scent when crushed. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and along woodland edges, thriving in cool, moist conditions."
