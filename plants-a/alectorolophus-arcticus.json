    "intro": "Alectorolophus arcticus, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its environment. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, helping to reduce water loss in cold climates. The Arctic bellflower plays an important role in pollination and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its ecosystem."
