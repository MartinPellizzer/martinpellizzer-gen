    "intro": "Arbutus alpina, commonly known as the alpine bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features dark green, leathery leaves that remain throughout the year, and it produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring. The plant bears red, berry-like fruits that are edible for humans and wildlife. Arbutus alpina thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions. Its dense growth habit makes it an important component of mountain ecosystems."
