    "intro": "Astracantha divaricata, commonly known as the variable thorned cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. Astracantha divaricata is often found in coastal and mountainous regions, where it adapts to varying climatic conditions."
