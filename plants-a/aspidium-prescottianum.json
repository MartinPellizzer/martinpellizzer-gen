It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its large, intricate fronds. The plant's structure includes a rhizome with sporangia that produce spores for reproduction. Aspidium prescottianum was widespread in swampy environments and played a significant role in ancient ecosystems. Fossil records indicate that it contributed to the formation of coal deposits through its extensive growth and decay."
