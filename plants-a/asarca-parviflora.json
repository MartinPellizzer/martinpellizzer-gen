    "intro": "Asarca parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered asarum, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by specific insects, and it produces small, dark berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Asarca parviflora is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
