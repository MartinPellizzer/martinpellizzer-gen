    "intro": "Arabis arenosa var. multijuga, commonly known as the sandstone rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are linear and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, helping to reduce water loss. It is often found in rocky outcrops, gravelly slopes, and dry meadows, thriving in harsh, nutrient-poor environments."
