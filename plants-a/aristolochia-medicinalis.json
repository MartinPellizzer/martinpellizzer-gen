    "intro": "Aristolochia medicinalis, commonly known as the birthwort, is a climbing vine native to parts of Asia and the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, hooded flowers that range in color from green to purple. The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic and have been linked to severe kidney damage. Despite its medicinal use in traditional herbal medicine, it is now considered a potential carcinogen and is banned in many countries. Its complex chemical composition makes it a subject of both scientific study and caution."
