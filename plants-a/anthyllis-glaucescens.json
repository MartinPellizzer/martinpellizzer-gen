It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to thrive in dry, rocky environments. Anthyllis glaucescens is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
