    "intro": "Acetosa pratensis subsp. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in open, rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes. The plant features slender stems and trifoliate leaves with a slightly sour taste due to its high content of organic acids. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous environments and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies.",
