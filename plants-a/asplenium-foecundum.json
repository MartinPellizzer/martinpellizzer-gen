    "intro": "Asplenium foecundum, commonly known as the fertile spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant that typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are often clustered at the base, and it produces spores in small, clustered structures called sorangia. Asplenium foecundum is found in tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Its botanical features make it well adapted to its specific ecological niche."
