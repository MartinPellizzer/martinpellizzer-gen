    "intro": "Androsace tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly arete, is a low-growing alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features a dense rosette of fuzzy, silver-green leaves that help it retain moisture and withstand harsh weather conditions. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which are clustered in a corymb-like inflorescence. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its delicate structure, it is typically cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant in cooler climates."
