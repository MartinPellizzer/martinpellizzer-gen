It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, making it well-suited for tropical and subtropical climates. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist, organic-rich soil, while its spores are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. The plant's unique morphology and adaptability make it a notable species within its ecological niche.",
