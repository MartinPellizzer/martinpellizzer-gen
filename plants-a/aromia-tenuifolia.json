    "intro": "Aromia tenuifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils along stream banks and in marshy areas. The plant features slender, arrow-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. Its small, white flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Aromia tenuifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in wetland ecosystems."
