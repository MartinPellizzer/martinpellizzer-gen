    "intro": "Agrostis alba var. decumbens, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, silver-haired leaves that give it a distinctive appearance, and it often forms dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil make it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
