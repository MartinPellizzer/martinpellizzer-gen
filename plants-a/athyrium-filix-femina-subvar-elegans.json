    "intro": "Athyrium filix-femina subvar. elegans, commonly known as the lady fern, is a shade-loving fern native to eastern North America. It features delicate, bipinnate fronds that are gracefully arching and often have a bluish-green hue. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread slowly. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland settings. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden use in shaded areas."
