    "intro": "Antennaria dioica var. congesta, commonly known as the clustered mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to northern regions of North America. It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, often covering the entire plant. The leaves are spoon-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and wetlands. This variant is distinguished by its more compact growth habit compared to other forms of Antennaria dioica."
