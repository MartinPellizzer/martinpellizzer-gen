    "intro": "Acacia doratoxylon, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its yellow flowers, which appear in globular clusters and bloom in spring. The plant has phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that perform the function of true leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Acacia doratoxylon is also noted for its hard, dense wood, which is used in various applications.",

This species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It is often seen in open woodlands and along riverbanks. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within these states.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia doratoxylon was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly used for afforestation and land rehabilitation projects due to its hardy nature. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and can tolerate drought conditions. It is also valued for its timber and as a source of fodder for livestock. Its introduction has helped in restoring degraded lands in several parts of Africa and Australia."
