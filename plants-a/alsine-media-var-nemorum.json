    "intro": "Alsine media var. nemorum, commonly known as woodland alsike, is a low-growing perennial herb native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions. It features slender, ascending stems that bear small, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in woodland understories. It is often found in association with other moisture-loving plants in forested areas."
