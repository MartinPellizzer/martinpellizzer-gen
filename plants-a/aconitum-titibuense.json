It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed. Its roots contain toxic alkaloids, making it a potentially dangerous plant to handle. Aconitum titibuense thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats.",
