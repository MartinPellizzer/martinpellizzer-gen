    "intro": "Alyssum calycinum var. minimum, commonly known as the dwarf alpine alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has slender, branching stems covered in fine, silvery-gray hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a similar fuzzy coating. This variety is prized for its ornamental value in rock gardens and as a ground cover in alpine settings."
