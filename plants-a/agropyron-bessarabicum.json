    "intro": "Agropyron bessarabicum, commonly known as the Bessarabian needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the steppes of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-based flowers. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Its botanical features make it an important component of steppe ecosystems."
