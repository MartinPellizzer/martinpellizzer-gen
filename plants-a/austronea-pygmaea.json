    "intro": "Austronea pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf lily, is a small flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Liliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, making it a striking addition to miniature gardens or rockeries. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the humid environment. Austronea pygmaea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
