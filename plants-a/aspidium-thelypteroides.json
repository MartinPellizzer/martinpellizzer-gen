    "intro": "Aspidium thelypteroides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Aspidium thelypteroides plays a role in maintaining ecological balance by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates."
