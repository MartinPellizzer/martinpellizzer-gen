    "intro": "Aidia forbesii, commonly known as the Forbes' aidia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Aidia forbesii is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
