    "intro": "Aeschynanthus szcokhoffii, commonly known as the golden crown vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant, showy flowers. The plant produces tubular, orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a distinctive golden stripe running down the throat.

Aeschynanthus szcokhoffii is popular as a decorative plant due to its ornamental flowers and ability to cascade from hanging baskets."
