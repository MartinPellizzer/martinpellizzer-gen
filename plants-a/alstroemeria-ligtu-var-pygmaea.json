    "intro": "Alstroemeria ligtu var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf alstroemeria, is a compact, evergreen perennial native to the Andes of South America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of vivid, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows to a height of only 10\u201315 cm, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a container plant. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Its small size and colorful blooms make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
