    "intro": "Acetosella erythrorhiza, commonly known as red-rooted sorrel, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its distinctive red stems and leaves with a sour taste due to its high oxalic acid content. The plant typically thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its small, pink or white flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces capsules that contain numerous small seeds. Acetosella erythrorhiza is often found in calcareous soils and is valued for its ornamental and historical uses.",
