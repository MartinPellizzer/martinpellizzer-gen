    "intro": "Afroaster nubimontis, commonly known as the cloud mountain aster, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust growth habits. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in montane forests and rocky outcrops. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers, which bloom in late summer, are small and clustered, producing a soft blue or purple hue that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies."
