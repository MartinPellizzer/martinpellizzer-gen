    "intro": "Aira elegans subsp. ambigua, commonly known as the slender false oat, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological systems supporting pollinators and other wildlife."
