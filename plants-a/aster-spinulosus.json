    "intro": "Aster spinulosus, commonly known as the rough aster, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It produces small, seed-like fruits called cypselae, which are dispersed by wind. Aster spinulosus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
