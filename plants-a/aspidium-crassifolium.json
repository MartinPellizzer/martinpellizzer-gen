    "intro": "Aspidium crassifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often dark green fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas, where it thrives in high humidity. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, and they are covered by a protective indusium. Aspidium crassifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive foliage."
