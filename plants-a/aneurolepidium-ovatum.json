    "intro": "Aneurolepidium ovatum, commonly known as the slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and forest edges. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often less than 30 centimeters tall, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a single, dense spikelet that is usually borne at the top of the stem. Aneurolepidium ovatum is characterized by its small, wind-pollinated flowers and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
