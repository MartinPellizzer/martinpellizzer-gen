    "intro": "Acacia conniana, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and bipinnate leaves composed of small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow globular flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and scrublands. Acacia conniana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in native ecosystems.",

This plant thrives in dry and semi-arid environments, often growing in shrublands and woodland areas. It is well adapted to the local climate and soil conditions of the region. Acacia conniana plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia conniana was mainly introduced to New Zealand as part of ecological restoration and soil stabilization efforts. It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas where it helps prevent erosion and supports local biodiversity. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adaptable to a range of environmental conditions. Due to its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen, it has been widely used in reforestation projects. However, its invasive potential has raised concerns in some regions where it may outcompete native species."
