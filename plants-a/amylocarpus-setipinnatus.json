It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy inflorescence. The plant produces edible tubers that are similar in texture to traditional arrowroot but have a different flavor profile. Its leaves are large, arrow-shaped, and often have a waxy surface. The plant is valued both for its ornamental qualities and its potential culinary uses."
