    "intro": "Aristolochia meridionaliana subsp. milnensis, commonly known as the southern pipevine, is a perennial climbing vine native to South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, aromatic leaves and distinctive, pipe-like flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, musky odor. The plant belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is known for its toxic properties due to the presence of aristolochic acids. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique floral structure plays a role in attracting specific pollinators, such as certain species of flies and beetles."
