    "intro": "Armeria filicaulis var. valentina, commonly known as the Valentine's thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of bright pink to red flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators."
