    "intro": "Astragalus rhizocephalus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Astragalus rhizocephalus plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native ecosystems."
