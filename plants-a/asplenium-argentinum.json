    "intro": "Asplenium argentinum, commonly known as the Argentine spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to South America. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of ferns. Asplenium argentinum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, indirect light conditions."
