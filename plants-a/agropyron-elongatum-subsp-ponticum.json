It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and agricultural fields. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
