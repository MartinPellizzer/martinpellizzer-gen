    "intro": "Asplenium juglandifolium var. subcrenulatum, commonly known as the holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant features a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread slowly across the forest floor. Its leaves are usually pinnately compound, with the terminal pinnae being rounded and slightly curled at the edges. This variety is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
