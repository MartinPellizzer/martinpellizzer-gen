    "intro": "Aristolochia minutiflora var. dolabrata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and its unique, hooded flowers that resemble a pipe. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its vines can grow up to 10 feet long, often climbing or trailing along the ground. The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic and have been linked to severe kidney damage in humans."
