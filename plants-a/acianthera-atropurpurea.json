    "intro": "Acianthera atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple-flowered orchid, is a tropical orchid species native to Central and South America. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with fleshy leaves that help store water in its natural habitat. The plant produces striking, violet to purple flowers with a distinctive spurred lip, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant.",
