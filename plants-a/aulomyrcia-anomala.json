    "intro": "Aulomyrcia anomala, commonly known as the red-flowered sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves and striking red or pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. The plant is part of the Myrtaceae family, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees, and is known for its fragrant oils. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
