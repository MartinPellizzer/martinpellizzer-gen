    "intro": "Aridarum embalohense, commonly known as the Embalohense Ghost Orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of western Africa. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale, translucent petals and sepals that resemble spectral forms. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the bark of trees in the dense canopy of its habitat. Its flowers are small and delicate, often appearing in clusters, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
