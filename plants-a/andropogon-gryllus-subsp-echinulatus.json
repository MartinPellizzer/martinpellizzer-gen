It features tall, slender stems with rough, hairy surfaces, and its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, bristle-tipped flowers. It thrives in full sun and is commonly found in open woodlands and prairies. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it a valuable species for erosion control."
