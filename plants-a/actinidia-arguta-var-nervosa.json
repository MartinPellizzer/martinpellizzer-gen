It is characterized by its finely veined leaves and small, edible berries that are often consumed fresh or used in jams. The plant thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained, fertile soil. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to produce fruit in cooler regions. Its vigorous growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or espalier training.",
