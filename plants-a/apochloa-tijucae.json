    "intro": "Apochloa tijucae, commonly known as Tijuana grass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of Baja California and southern California. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Apochloa tijucae plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in its native habitat."
