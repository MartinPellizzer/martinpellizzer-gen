    "intro": "Agropyron subsecundum, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in harsh environments. Agropyron subsecundum is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
