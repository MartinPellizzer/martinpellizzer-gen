    "intro": "Asphodelus virgatus, commonly known as the slender asphodel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in Mediterranean climates. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, spiky inflorescences with yellow or orange flowers. Its fibrous roots are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Asphodelus virgatus is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas."
