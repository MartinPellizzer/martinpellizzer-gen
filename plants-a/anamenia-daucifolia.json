It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other aromatic plants like parsley and dill. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and an umbrella-shaped inflorescence known as a compound umbel. Its flowers are typically white with a single purple or pink flower at the center, and it produces small, angular fruits called schizocarps. Anamenia daucifolia is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including meadows and roadsides."
