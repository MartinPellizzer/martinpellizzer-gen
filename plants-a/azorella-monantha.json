    "intro": "Azorella monantha, commonly known as the Andean rock cress, is a hardy perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form that helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate touch to its rocky habitat. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water and withstand strong winds. Azorella monantha is also noted for its ability to form long-lived clonal colonies, making it a resilient component of alpine ecosystems."
