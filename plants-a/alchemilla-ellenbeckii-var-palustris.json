    "intro": "Alchemilla ellenbeckii var. palustris, commonly known as swamp lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It features rosettes of basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in clusters atop leafless stems. It thrives in moist, poorly drained soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Due to its preference for wet environments, it is an important component of wetland ecosystems."
