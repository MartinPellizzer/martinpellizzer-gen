It is characterized by its basal rosette of fern-like, lobed leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is often found in rocky soils and desert habitats. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important species in its native range."
