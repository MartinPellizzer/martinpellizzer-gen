    "intro": "Atractylis flava var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth yellow marsh-orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant features a robust rhizome and produces clusters of yellow flowers with a distinctive orchid-like appearance. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered with fine hairs, though the variant glabrescens has reduced hair, giving it a smoother texture. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
