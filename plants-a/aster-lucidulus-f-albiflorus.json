    "intro": "Aster lucidulus f. albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered aster, is a flowering plant belonging to the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its showy, white to pale yellow ray florets and dark purple disk florets, which give it a distinctive appearance. Native to the eastern United States, this plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. It produces small, oval-shaped fruits called cypselae, which are dispersed by wind. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
