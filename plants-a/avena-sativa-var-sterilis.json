    "intro": "Avena sativa var. sterilis, commonly known as the sterile oat, is a variant of the common oat that is characterized by its inability to produce viable seeds. This plant is typically shorter and more compact than its fertile counterpart, with reduced flowering and seed development. It retains the general morphology of oats, featuring hollow stems and leaf blades with a distinctive blue-green color. The sterile oat is often used in agricultural research to study plant genetics and breeding. Its cultivation can also serve as a method to control weed growth in certain environments."
