    "intro": "Aspidium acanthophyllum, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are covered in small, spine-like structures, giving it a rugged appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices, across parts of Asia and Africa. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spores rather than seeds. Aspidium acanthophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its unique foliage."
