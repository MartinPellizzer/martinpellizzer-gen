    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa f. sorbifolia, commonly known as the sticky alder or black alder, is a subspecies of the alder tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are often covered in a sticky resin, which gives it its common name. The plant is a deciduous tree or shrub, typically growing in moist, well-drained soils near water sources. Its flowers are catkins, and it produces small, nut-like fruits that are dispersed by wind. The subspecies is noted for its ability to thrive in wetland environments and its role in soil stabilization."
