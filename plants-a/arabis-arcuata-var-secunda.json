    "intro": "Arabis arcuata var. secunda, commonly known as the creeping rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has dark green, succulent leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
