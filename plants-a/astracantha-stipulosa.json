    "intro": "Astracantha stipulosa, commonly known as the stipuleless astracantha, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to red. The plant typically grows as a shrub or perennial herb, often with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure. Astracantha stipulosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
