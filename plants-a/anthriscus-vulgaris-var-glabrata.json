    "intro": "Anthriscus vulgaris var. glabrata, commonly known as smooth cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and white, umbel-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and prefers full sun to partial shade. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for both ecological and ornamental purposes."
