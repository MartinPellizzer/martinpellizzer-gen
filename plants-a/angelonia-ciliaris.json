    "intro": "Angelonia ciliaris, commonly known as the summer snapdragon, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to pink and purple. The plant produces numerous small, delicate flowers along branching stems, which bloom throughout the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, providing a textured appearance. Angelonia ciliaris is well-suited for garden beds and containers due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in full sun."
