    "intro": "Aloe broomii var. broomii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features narrow, upright leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers on tall, branched inflorescences during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal watering. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
