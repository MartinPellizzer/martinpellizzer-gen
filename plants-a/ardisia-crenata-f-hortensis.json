    "intro": "Ardisia crenata f. hortensis, commonly known as the dwarf ardisia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green elliptical leaves that are arranged in whorls along the stems. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often used as ornamental features. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for shaded garden spaces. Its dense foliage and seasonal color changes make it a versatile and attractive addition to both indoor and outdoor landscapes."
