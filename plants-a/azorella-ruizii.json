    "intro": "Azorella ruizii, commonly known as the Chilean mat grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Andes mountains of Chile. It belongs to the Apiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. Azorella ruizii thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in rocky or alpine regions with poor soil. Its unique structure allows it to withstand harsh climatic conditions, making it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
