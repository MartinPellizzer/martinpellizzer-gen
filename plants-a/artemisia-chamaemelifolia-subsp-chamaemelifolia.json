    "intro": "Artemisia chamaemelifolia subsp. chamaemelifolia, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rocky or dry garden conditions. Its strong, pungent scent is due to the presence of volatile oils such as thujone and camphor."
