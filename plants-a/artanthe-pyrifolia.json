    "intro": "Artanthe pyrifolia, commonly known as the fireleaf plant, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features striking, palmately lobed leaves that resemble the shape of a fire, hence its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, adding visual interest in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
