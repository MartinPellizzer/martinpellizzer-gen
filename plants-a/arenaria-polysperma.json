    "intro": "Arenaria polysperma, commonly known as the sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as coastal dunes, meadows, and disturbed areas. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in arid environments. Arenaria polysperma is also known for its ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative growth, making it a resilient and widespread species."
