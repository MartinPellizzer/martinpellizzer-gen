    "intro": "Agave neomexicana, commonly known as the New Mexico agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are covered in a layer of white wax. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with small, white to greenish flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Agave neomexicana is often used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
