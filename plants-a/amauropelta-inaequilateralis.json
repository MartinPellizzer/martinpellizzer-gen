    "intro": "Amauropelta inaequilateralis, commonly known as the unequal-leaf shield fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its unique, asymmetrical fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its leaves are leathery and have a distinctive shield-like shape, with a complex arrangement of pinnae. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
