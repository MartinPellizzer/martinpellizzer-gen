    "intro": "Andreettaea longilabris, commonly known as the long-lipped orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, elongated lip that is often a contrasting color to the rest of the flower. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are small but numerous, arranged in dense clusters that enhance its ornamental appeal. The botanical features of Andreettaea longilabris make it a unique and valuable species for both horticultural and ecological studies."
