    "intro": "Althaea kraussiana, commonly known as the Persian marshmallow, is a perennial herb native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a soft, woolly texture. The plant produces clusters of pale pink to white flowers during the summer months, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous small seeds. Althaea kraussiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its mucilage-rich roots. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks."
