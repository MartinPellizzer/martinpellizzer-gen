It thrives in humid and warm climates with high rainfall. The plant is commonly found in lowland areas with rich soil. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is part of the biodiversity of the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha elskensii was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and spreads rapidly through seed dispersal. Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect local ecosystems."
