It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
