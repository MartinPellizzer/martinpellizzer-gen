    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 chingii, commonly known as the Chinese spleenwort, is a hybrid fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and slightly glossy. The plant produces small, clustered spore sacs on the undersides of its leaves, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Native to eastern Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
