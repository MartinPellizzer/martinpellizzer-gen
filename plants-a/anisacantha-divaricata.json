    "intro": "Anisacantha divaricata, commonly known as the spreading starbursh, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant features slender, spreading stems with small, opposite leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are white to pink and are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, blooming during the warmer months. Anisacantha divaricata is adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
