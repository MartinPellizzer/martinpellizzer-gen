    "intro": "Acacia pellacantha, commonly known as the broad-leaved wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and bipinnate leaves that are often broad and leathery. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical heads, which are typical of the Acacia genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia pellacantha is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is commonly found in savannas and shrublands. This plant is well adapted to drought conditions and can survive in areas with low rainfall. It is often seen growing along roadsides and in open habitats where it can receive ample sunlight. Acacia pellacantha plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia pellacantha was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and provide shade in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly used in reclamation projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant's rapid growth and deep root system make it effective for stabilizing degraded lands. However, its introduction has sometimes led to competition with native vegetation. It is now widely cultivated in regions such as Australia, Africa, and parts of Asia."
