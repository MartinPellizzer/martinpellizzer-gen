    "intro": "Allium maraschicum, commonly known as the maraschino garlic, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in the spring. The plant has strap-shaped leaves and forms a bulbous stem that is often used in culinary applications. Its botanical name reflects its historical association with the maraschino cherry, though the connection is more cultural than botanical. It is valued for both its ornamental beauty and its mild, garlicky flavor."
