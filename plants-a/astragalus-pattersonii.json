It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus pattersonii is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native range."
