    "intro": "Agrostis vinealis subsp. ericetorum, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like vegetation that thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. It is often found in open habitats such as heaths, moors, and along coastal areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in challenging environments."
