    "intro": "Abies excelsa var. communis, commonly known as the Colombian silver fir, is a coniferous tree native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged spirally along the stems. The tree produces small, yellowish cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, typically found on the lower branches. It thrives in cool, moist climates at high elevations, often growing in cloud forests. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies excelsa var. communis is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southeastern Europe, including parts of the Carpathian Mountains, the Alps, and the Balkans. This variety is commonly found in high-altitude coniferous forests where the climate is cool and moist. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with other coniferous species such as fir and spruce. The plant is adapted to temperate to subalpine environments, typically growing above the tree line in some areas. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches that provide the necessary conditions for its growth.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies excelsa var. communis was mainly introduced to areas with high elevation and cool, moist climates, typically found in mountainous regions. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires ample sunlight for optimal growth. This variety is often planted in landscapes for its ornamental value and ability to provide habitat for wildlife. Its introduction has been primarily for reforestation and ornamental horticulture purposes. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native environments."
