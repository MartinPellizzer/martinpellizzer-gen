    "intro": "Anthoxanthum aetnense, commonly known as the Etna golden grass, is a perennial grass species native to the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and produces small, yellowish to brownish spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude conditions of its habitat. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, and it plays a minor role in local ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
