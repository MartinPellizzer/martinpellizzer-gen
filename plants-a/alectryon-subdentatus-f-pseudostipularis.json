    "intro": "Alectryon subdentatus f. pseudostipularis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alectryon, is a variant of the Australian native plant Alectryon subdentatus. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release its seeds. This form is typically found in coastal and sandy soils, thriving in the warmer, drier regions of southeastern Australia."
