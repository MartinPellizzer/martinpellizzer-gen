    "intro": "Asparagus officinalis var. strictus, commonly known as the compact asparagus, is a compact variety of the asparagus plant characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit. It features feathery, fern-like leaves that are typically bright green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, tender shoots in the spring. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and manageable size. This variety is well-suited for container gardening and can thrive in well-drained soil with full sun to partial shade."
