    "intro": "Agathosma foliosa, commonly known as African geranium, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue or purple flowers during the cooler months. It is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant."
