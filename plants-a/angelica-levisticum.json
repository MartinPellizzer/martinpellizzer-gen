    "intro": "Angelica levisticum, commonly known as love-in-a-mist, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and delicate, sparsely hairy leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Angelica levisticum is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
