    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena integerrima var. evectifolia is primarily native to New Zealand. It is commonly found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury region. This plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often associated with open grasslands and shrublands. It is well adapted to the temperate climate of New Zealand. The variety is known for its small, spiny fruits and is part of the native flora of the country.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena integerrima var. evectifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various habitats. The plant spreads rapidly through seed dispersal by birds and wind. Its establishment has led to ecological concerns in some regions of New Zealand."
