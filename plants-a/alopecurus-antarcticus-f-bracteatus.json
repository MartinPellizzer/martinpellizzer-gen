    "intro": "Alopecurus antarcticus f. bracteatus, commonly known as the Antarctic grass, is a variant of the Antarctic grass species native to southern regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in nutrient-poor, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold, temperate climates. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine and coastal ecosystems."
