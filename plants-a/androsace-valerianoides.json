    "intro": "Androsace valerianoides, commonly known as the alpine buttonweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, emerging from the leaf axils during the summer months. It thrives in cool, moist, and well-drained soils, often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and as a ground cover in shady, moist environments."
