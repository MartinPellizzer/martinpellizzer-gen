    "intro": "Arnica multiflora, commonly known as mountain arnica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, basal leaves and clusters of yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces a milky sap that contains various bioactive compounds, including sesquiterpene lactones. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. Arnica multiflora is often used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
