    "intro": "Angelica discocarpa, commonly known as the mountain angelica, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its tall, branched stem and large, compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and digestive properties. Angelica discocarpa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas."
