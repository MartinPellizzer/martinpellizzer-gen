    "intro": "Astronium gracile, commonly known as the small-leafed sycamore, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Hippocastanaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits containing one or two seeds. It is often found in humid lowland forests and is valued for its hard, durable wood. Due to habitat loss, Astronium gracile is considered vulnerable to extinction in some regions."
