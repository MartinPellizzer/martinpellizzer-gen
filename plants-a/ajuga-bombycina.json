    "intro": "Ajuga bombycina, commonly known as carpet bugle or velvetleaf ajuga, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to form dense mats, making it effective for erosion control and ground cover. Ajuga bombycina is well adapted to moist to wet soils and partial to full shade, thriving in woodland environments."
