    "intro": "Aspidium trejoi, commonly known as the Mexican water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium trejoi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
