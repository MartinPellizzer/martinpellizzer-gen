It is characterized by its stout, spiny stems and dense, fern-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into edible, needle-like berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Asparagus erinaceus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits."
