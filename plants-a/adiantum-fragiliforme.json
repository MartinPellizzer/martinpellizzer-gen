    "intro": "Adiantum fragiliforme, commonly known as the brittle frond maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are often described as fragile and translucent. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a unique structure that allows for efficient water retention. Adiantum fragiliforme is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light.",
