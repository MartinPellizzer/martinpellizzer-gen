It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, anchoring itself with rhizomes. Its spores are produced on the underside of the leaves, which are usually divided into small, toothed segments. Asplenium baldwinii is native to parts of Asia and is often found in humid, forested areas."
