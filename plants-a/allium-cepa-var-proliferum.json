It is characterized by its multiple stalks emerging from a single base, creating a bushy appearance. The plant produces edible leaves and bulbous stems that are similar to those of the common leek but with a more robust growth habit. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This variety is valued for its culinary use and ornamental appeal in gardens."
