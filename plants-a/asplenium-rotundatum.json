The plant produces spores in small, clustered clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are typically found in the lower portion of the leaf. It is native to various regions in the Americas and is often seen in humid, tropical or subtropical climates. Asplenium rotundatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
