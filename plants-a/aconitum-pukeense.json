    "intro": "Aconitum pukeense, commonly known as the Pukeko River aconite, is a striking perennial herb native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple spathaceous flowers that are clustered at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a rough, hairy texture that aids in water retention. Aconitum pukeense contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling.",
