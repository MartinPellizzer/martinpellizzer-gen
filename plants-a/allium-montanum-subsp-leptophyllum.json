    "intro": "Allium montanum subsp. leptophyllum, commonly known as the slender bulb onion, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, often in rocky or well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves and small, white or pale purple flowers arranged in a spherical umbel. Its bulbs are small and often used in local cuisines for their mild, onion-like flavor. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and culinary potential in high-altitude gardens."
