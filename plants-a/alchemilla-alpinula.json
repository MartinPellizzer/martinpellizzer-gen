    "intro": "Alchemilla alpinula, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of soft, velvety leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, branched inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Alchemilla alpinula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shady, moist environments."
