    "intro": "Armeriastrum scabrellum, commonly known as roughleaf sandverbena, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often used in native plant gardens."
