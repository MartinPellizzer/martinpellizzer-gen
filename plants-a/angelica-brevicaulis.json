    "intro": "Angelica brevicaulis, commonly known as the short-stemmed angelica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and tall, umbellate flower clusters. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer, are white to pale green and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Angelica brevicaulis is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
