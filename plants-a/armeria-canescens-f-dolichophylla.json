    "intro": "Armeria canescens f. dolichophylla, commonly known as the long-leaved thrift, is a variant of the common thrift plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its grayish-blue, woolly leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime climates. It has a low-growing habit with multiple stems and is well adapted to salty, wind-swept environments. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
