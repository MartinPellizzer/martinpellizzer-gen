    "intro": "Anthoxanthum elongatum, commonly known as the slender oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often hairless or sparsely hairy, and its leaves are narrow and slightly folded. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged, with each spikelet containing several small, two-lobed florets. Anthoxanthum elongatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
