    "intro": "Ascolabium pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf rock orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of South America. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in areas with cool, moist conditions. The plant produces a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and bears small, pale green or white flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. It is adapted to thrive in harsh, alpine environments, showcasing specialized growth patterns to survive extreme weather conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
