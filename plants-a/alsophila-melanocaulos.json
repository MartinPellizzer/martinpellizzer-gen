    "intro": "Alsophila melanocaulos, commonly known as the black-stemmed tree fern, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk that is covered in a dark, fibrous sheath. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The fronds are typically bioluminescent at night, which helps attract pollinators."
