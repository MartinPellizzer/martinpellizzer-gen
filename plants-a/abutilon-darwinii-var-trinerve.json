This variant is commonly found in the temperate regions of these countries. It thrives in areas with well-drained soil and moderate to warm climates. The plant is often associated with dry grasslands and shrublands. Its native distribution is largely confined to the southern part of South America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon darwinii var. trinerve was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there during the 19th century as part of the botanical collections from South America. The plant is commonly found in coastal and disturbed areas, where it thrives in sunny, well-drained soils. It has become naturalized in certain regions and is considered a potential weed in some areas. Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems."
