    "intro": "Andersonia axilliflora, commonly known as the coastal bell heath, is a flowering plant native to the southern coast of Western Australia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, which bloom from late autumn to early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and strong winds. Andersonia axilliflora is also known for its ability to form dense mats, which help stabilize coastal dunes."
