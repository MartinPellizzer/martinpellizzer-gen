    "intro": "Agave neglecta, commonly known as the desert spoon, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, with a spiky margin. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears small, white to pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are adapted to store water, making it highly drought-tolerant. Agave neglecta is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
