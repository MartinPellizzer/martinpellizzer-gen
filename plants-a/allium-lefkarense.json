    "intro": "Allium lefkarense, commonly known as the Lefkara garlic, is a rare bulbous plant native to Cyprus. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered bulbs underground. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
