    "intro": "Acaciella rekoi, commonly known as the Koa tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers. The tree produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in coastal and lowland habitats, often growing in areas with well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss and historical overharvesting, Acaciella rekoi is considered a vulnerable species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaciella rekoi is primarily native to the rainforests of western Africa, specifically countries such as Sierra Leone, Liberia, and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. It thrives in the humid, shaded understory of these tropical forests. The plant is commonly found in areas with rich organic soil and high rainfall. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for local wildlife. Due to habitat loss, Acaciella rekoi is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaciella rekoi was mainly introduced to the island of Madagascar. It is believed to have been introduced through human activity, possibly as an ornamental plant or for other utilitarian purposes. The plant has since become established in certain habitats, particularly in dry and semi-arid regions. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread, it has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive. Its distribution is currently limited but continues to be monitored by local conservation authorities."
