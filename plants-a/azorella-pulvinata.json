    "intro": "Azorella pulvinata, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosette of leaves that form a compact cushion shape. The plant is adapted to harsh alpine environments, featuring a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in umbels, and it produces fruits that are dry, schizocarpic achenes. Azorella pulvinata plays a significant ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
