    "intro": "Acantholimon armenum, commonly known as Armenian sandthorn, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Armenia and Turkey. It belongs to the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Acantholimon armenum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon armenum is primarily native to Iraq, Lebanon-Syria, Transcaucasus, and Turkey. This plant is commonly found in rocky and arid environments across these regions. It thrives in mountainous and semi-desert areas, often growing on limestone substrates. Its distribution reflects its adaptation to the Mediterranean and adjacent climates. The species is of particular interest due to its limited range and ecological significance in these areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon armenum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, typically in dry to semi-arid environments. It thrives in regions with moderate temperatures and low humidity, making it suitable for cultivation in Mediterranean climates. This plant is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, where it can establish itself along slopes or in disturbed areas. Its introduction has been noted in several regions outside its native range, including parts of North America and Australia. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant."
