    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia pulcherrima is primarily native to Central America, the Caribbean, and northern South America. It is commonly found in countries such as Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, and parts of Colombia. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and lowland regions. It is also known as the \"Christmas tree\" due to its bright red flowers that bloom around the holiday season. Acacia pulcherrima is a popular ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and adaptability to various growing conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia pulcherrima was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for ornamental purposes due to its striking red flowers. It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas in countries such as Mexico, India, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming an invasive species in certain regions. Despite its beauty, it requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption."
