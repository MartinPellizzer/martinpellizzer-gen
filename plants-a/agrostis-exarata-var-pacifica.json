    "intro": "Agrostis exarata var. pacifica, commonly known as Pacific bentgrass, is a cool-season grass native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, dense turf and fine, bluish-green foliage. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and wetlands. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form extensive mats. Its adaptability to salt spray and sandy soils makes it an important plant in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
