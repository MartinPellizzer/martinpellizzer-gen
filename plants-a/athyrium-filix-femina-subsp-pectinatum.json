    "intro": "Athyrium filix-femina subsp. pectinatum, commonly known as the feather-leaf maidenhair fern, is a shade-loving fern native to eastern Asia. It features delicate, arching fronds with a distinctive, finely divided, feather-like appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade. This subspecies is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
