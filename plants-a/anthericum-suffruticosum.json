    "intro": "Anthericum suffruticosum, commonly known as the creeping arum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. The plant has heart-shaped, arrowhead-like leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a spathe, typical of the Araceae family. Anthericum suffruticosum prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
