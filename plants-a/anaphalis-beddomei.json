    "intro": "Anaphalis beddomei, commonly known as the beddome's plume, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its fluffy, white capitula that resemble small clouds. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, often in alpine environments. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Anaphalis beddomei is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique visual appeal."
