    "intro": "Aloe macrocarpa var. major, commonly known as the giant aloe or Cape aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and large, fleshy, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its size and striking appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
