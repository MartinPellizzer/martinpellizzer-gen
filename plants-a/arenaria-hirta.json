    "intro": "Arenaria hirta, commonly known as hairy sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of succulent, hairy leaves that help retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in early summer, which are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are often covered in fine, erect hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Arenaria hirta is well adapted to cold, rocky, and sandy soils, making it a hardy species found in mountainous and tundra habitats."
