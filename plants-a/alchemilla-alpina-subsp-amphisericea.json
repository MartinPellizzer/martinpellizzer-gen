    "intro": "Alchemilla alpina subsp. amphisericea, commonly known as the Alpine Lady's Mantle, is a perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, hairy, and often silver-gray leaves that form a dense mat. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in loose clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and hardy addition to alpine gardens and natural habitats."
