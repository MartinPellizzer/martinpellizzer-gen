    "intro": "Aporum auyongii, commonly known as the Auyong's orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that bear numerous fragrant, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat, and thrives in high humidity and filtered sunlight. Its intricate floral structure includes specialized lip petals that aid in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Aporum auyongii is considered a conservation concern."
