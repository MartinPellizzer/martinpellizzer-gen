    "intro": "Acer pictum var. mono, commonly known as the single-leaf maple, is a rare variant of the striped maple. It is characterized by its unique foliage, featuring a single, large leaf per stem, unlike the typical clustered leaves of its parent species. The leaves are usually palmately lobed with a striking contrast of green and gold on the upper and lower surfaces. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is native to specific regions of eastern North America. Due to its rarity and distinctive appearance, it is often sought after by botanists and horticulturists.",
