    "intro": "Annona coriacea var. amplexicaulis, commonly known as the creeping custard apple, is a tropical shrub characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that often wrap around the stems. It produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens. The fruit is a rough, green, egg-shaped berry that turns yellow when ripe, containing a large, segmented seed core. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is native to parts of South America. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruit, though caution is advised due to the presence of toxic compounds in the raw plant material."
