    "intro": "Armeria beirana, commonly known as the sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of western Europe and northern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its saline, sandy habitats. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for coastal gardens. Armeria beirana is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize sandy or rocky soils."
