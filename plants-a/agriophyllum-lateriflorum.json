    "intro": "Agriophyllum lateriflorum, commonly known as the silverleaf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is a low-growing, perennial shrub characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs that reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Agriophyllum lateriflorum plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment."
