    "intro": "Armeria lanceobracteata, commonly known as the lance-leaved thrift, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pink or white flowers. The plant features linear, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Armeria lanceobracteata is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its drought tolerance and hardiness."
