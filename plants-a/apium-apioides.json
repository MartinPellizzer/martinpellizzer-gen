    "intro": "Apium apioides, commonly known as wild carrot, is a biennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other aromatic herbs like parsley and dill. The plant has slender, hollow stems with finely divided, feather-like leaves that are often mistaken for parsnip or parsley. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels, typical of the carrot family. The fruit is a small, dry schizocarp that splits into two parts when mature, each containing a single seed."
