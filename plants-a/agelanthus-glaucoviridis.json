    "intro": "Agelanthus glaucoviridis, commonly known as the blue-green agelanthus, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage that features a distinctive blue-green hue, which is due to the presence of a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Agelanthus glaucoviridis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
