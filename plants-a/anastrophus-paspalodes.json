    "intro": "Anastrophus paspalodes, commonly known as the Mexican needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form a low, mat-like structure. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, typically with two to three flowering branches. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture. Anastrophus paspalodes is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
