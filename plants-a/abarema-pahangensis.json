    "intro": "Abarema pahangensis, commonly known as the Pahang legume, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its distinctive pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences. The seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds through mechanical means.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abarema pahangensis is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Peninsular Malaysia, particularly in the states of Pahang and Selangor. It is commonly found in secondary forests and disturbed areas within these regions. The plant thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and moderate rainfall. It is often associated with rocky or limestone substrates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema pahangensis was mainly introduced to Southeast Asia, particularly in Malaysia and Indonesia. It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in shaded undergrowth. The plant is known for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique flowering pattern. It has been cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections for its aesthetic appeal. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems."
