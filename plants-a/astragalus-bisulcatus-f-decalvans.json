    "intro": "Astragalus bisulcatus f. decalvans, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with multiple pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
