    "intro": "Anamirta baueriana, commonly known as the tropical water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, with a distinctive spatulate shape. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its roots help stabilize the soil, making it ecologically significant in wetland ecosystems."
