    "intro": "Aechmea polycephala, commonly known as the pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, waxy leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces a striking inflorescence with colorful bracts that range from red to orange. Aechmea polycephala is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in shaded, humid environments. Its ability to thrive in low-light conditions makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
