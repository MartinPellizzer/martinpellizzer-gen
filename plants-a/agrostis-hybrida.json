    "intro": "Agrostis hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas. Agrostis hybrida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass applications."
