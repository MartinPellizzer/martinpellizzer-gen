    "intro": "Anthemis chamomilla-romana, commonly known as Roman chamomile, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its daisy-like yellow flowers with white centers, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and has finely divided, fern-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Roman chamomile is known for its aromatic properties and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its calming and anti-inflammatory effects."
