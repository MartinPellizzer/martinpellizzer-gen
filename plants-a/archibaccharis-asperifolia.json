It is characterized by its dark green, rough-textured leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom throughout the dry season. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in coastal and tropical regions. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
