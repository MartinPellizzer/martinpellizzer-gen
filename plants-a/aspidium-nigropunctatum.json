    "intro": "Aspidium nigropunctatum, commonly known as the black-spotted wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, lanceolate fronds that are often marked with small, black dots, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky areas. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread gradually across the substrate. Aspidium nigropunctatum is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, where it thrives in temperate climates."
