    "intro": "Alnus emarginata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alder, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its alternate, ovate leaves that are typically narrower than those of other alder species. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by woody, cone-like fruits that release seeds when mature. Alnus emarginata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
