    "intro": "Arenaria villosa, commonly known as the hairy sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and rocky habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with many stolons, allowing it to spread across open ground. Its leaves are densely hairy, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Arenaria villosa is often found in coastal dunes, gravelly soils, and disturbed sites, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions."
