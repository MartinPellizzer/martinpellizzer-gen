    "intro": "Aconitum \u00d7 odontandrum, commonly known as the hybrid monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is a hybrid between Aconitum napellus and Aconitum lycoctonum, resulting in a plant with striking blue to purple spurred flowers. The plant features large, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in temperate climates. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.",
