    "intro": "Armeria villosa subsp. longearistata, commonly known as the woolly sea thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky shores. Its succulent leaves help it retain moisture in harsh, saline environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in maritime climates."
