    "intro": "Asplenium gaudichaudii, commonly known as the broad-leaf holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds. Asplenium gaudichaudii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
