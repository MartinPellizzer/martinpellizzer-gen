    "intro": "Aster brumalis, commonly known as the frost aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to purple, blooming in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it has a fibrous root system. Aster brumalis plays an important role in supporting pollinators and is often found in restoration ecology projects."
