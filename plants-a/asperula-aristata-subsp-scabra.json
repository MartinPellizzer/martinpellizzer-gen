    "intro": "Asperula aristata subsp. scabra, commonly known as the rough asperula, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features small, leathery, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to alpine gardens."
