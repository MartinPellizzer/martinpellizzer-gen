    "intro": "Agapetes oblonga var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed silver fir, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude forests of southern China. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and conical shape. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments, often on rocky slopes or in mountainous regions. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, with a distinctive silvery underside that reflects light. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
