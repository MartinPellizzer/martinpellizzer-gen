    "intro": "Aster alpinus subsp. alpinus, commonly known as the alpine aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom from late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapting to the cold, harsh conditions of its habitat. Aster alpinus subsp. alpinus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic alpine landscapes."
