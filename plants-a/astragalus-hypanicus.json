    "intro": "Astragalus hypanicus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Astragalus hypanicus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range."
