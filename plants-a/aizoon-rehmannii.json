    "intro": "Aizoon rehmannii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces yellow flowers resembling those of the common dandelion. The plant has fibrous roots and hairy stems, which help it conserve water in dry environments. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Aizoon rehmannii is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats."
