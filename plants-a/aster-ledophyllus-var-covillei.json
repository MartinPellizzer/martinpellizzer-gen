    "intro": "Aster ledophyllus var. covillei, commonly known as the Coville's blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and produces small, blue to purple flowers in late summer. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to bloom in hot, dry conditions."
