    "intro": "Acrostichum proliferum, commonly known as the giant waterfern, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas rapidly. Acrostichum proliferum plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and shelter for various water organisms.",
