    "intro": "Allocasuarina pinaster, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sheoak, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, needle-like leaves that are often clustered in groups of three, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spherical flowers that are typically green or reddish in color, which are followed by woody, cone-like structures. It is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in dunes or coastal heathlands. Allocasuarina pinaster is an important component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing dune systems."
