    "intro": "Arenaria montana var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of western North America. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early summer, typically blooming from June to July. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry, sunny locations."
