    "intro": "Asparagus grandiflorus, commonly known as the large-flowered asparagus, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or coastal gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its showy blooms and evergreen foliage. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
