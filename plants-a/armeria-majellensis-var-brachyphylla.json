The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. This variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to withstand coastal salt spray and strong winds."
