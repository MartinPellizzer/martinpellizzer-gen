    "intro": "Artemisia aprica, commonly known as spring wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring silver-gray foliage with a strong, aromatic scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that appear in early spring, contributing to its ornamental value. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, hairy structures that help reduce water loss. Artemisia aprica is often used in traditional medicine and as a decorative plant in gardens."
