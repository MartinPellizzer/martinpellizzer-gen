    "intro": "Anisotes involucratus, commonly known as the velvetleaf arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and a striking blue-violet flower spike that blooms in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rapid growth and dense foliage make it an effective pioneer species in disturbed wetland habitats. However, it can become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation."
