    "intro": "Aulonemia, commonly known as the common alpine aster, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its showy, composite flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple, pink, or white. Aulonemia species are native to mountainous regions in Europe and Asia, where they thrive in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plants have a rosette of basal leaves and produce numerous small florets arranged in a head. They are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
