    "intro": "Astrocodon expansus, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes many aquatic and semi-aquatic species. The plant is characterized by its broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are often floating on the water's surface. Its flowers are small and clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, which is enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. Astrocodon expansus is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in wet environments."
