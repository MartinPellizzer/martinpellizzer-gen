    "intro": "Arenaria muliensis, commonly known as the Muli sandflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of China. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its habitat. Arenaria muliensis is often found in rocky or sandy soils at elevations above 3,000 meters."
