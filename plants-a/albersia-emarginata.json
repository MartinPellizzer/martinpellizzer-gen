    "intro": "Albersia emarginata, commonly known as the dwarf alders, is a species of flowering plant in the family Betulaceae. It is native to parts of North America, particularly the eastern United States. This shrub typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 feet and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces catkins, which are cylindrical clusters of flowers, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Albersia emarginata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in shaded environments."
