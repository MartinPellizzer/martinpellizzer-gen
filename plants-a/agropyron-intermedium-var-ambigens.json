    "intro": "Agropyron intermedium var. ambigens, commonly known as the intermediate wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces spikelets that are arranged in dense clusters, with each spikelet containing two to three flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil. This variety is also valued for its potential in forage and as a component in polyculture systems."
