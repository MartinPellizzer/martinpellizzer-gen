    "intro": "Aegilops cylindrica var. pauciaristata, commonly known as the slender wild rye, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its genetic similarity to wheat, it is of interest in agricultural research for its potential in breeding programs."
