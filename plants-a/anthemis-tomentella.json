    "intro": "Anthemis tomentella, commonly known as the woolly anthemis, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its hairy leaves help reduce water loss, making it drought-tolerant. It is often found in coastal areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
