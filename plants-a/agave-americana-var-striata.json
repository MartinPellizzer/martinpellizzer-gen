    "intro": "Agave americana var. striata, commonly known as the Zebra Agave, is a striking succulent native to Mexico. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are blue-green in color with distinct white or light green stripes. The leaves are covered in a fine layer of white powder called farina, which helps reduce water loss. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. This variety is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
