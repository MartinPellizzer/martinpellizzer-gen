    "intro": "Aspidium miquelianum, commonly known as the Miquel's water fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into small, rounded lobes. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor the plant to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Aspidium miquelianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often used in water gardens or as a decorative element in shaded landscapes."
