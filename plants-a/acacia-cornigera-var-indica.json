    "intro": "Acacia cornigera var. indica, commonly known as the Indian acacia or the thorn acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces yellow, fragrant flowers that are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its seeds are encased in a pod and are sometimes used as a source of gum arabic. Acacia cornigera var. indica thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, making it a common species in dry regions of India and neighboring countries.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia cornigera var. indica is primarily native to the Indian subcontinent, including regions of India, Nepal, and Bangladesh. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in dry deciduous forests and thorny scrublands. This variant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a common sight in parts of southern and eastern India. It is also occasionally found in parts of Sri Lanka and the Andaman Islands. The plant plays an important ecological role in these regions, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia cornigera var. indica was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and along roadsides, thriving in sandy soils. This plant is often used in reforestation projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil. However, it can also become invasive in some ecosystems, outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has led to both ecological and economic impacts in the regions where it has established itself."
