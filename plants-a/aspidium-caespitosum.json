    "intro": "Aspidium caespitosum, commonly known as the bracken fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its feather-like fronds that are divided into numerous pinnae, giving it a lush, bushy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest floors. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Aspidium caespitosum is notable for its ability to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various small organisms."
