It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in mountainous environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ecological role in preventing soil erosion."
