It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201390 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Asta stricta thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and naturalized areas. Its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies adds ecological value to the environment."
