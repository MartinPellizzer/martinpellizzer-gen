The plant contains volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its strong medicinal and pesticidal properties. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and rocky areas. Artemisia augustana has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a component in herbal remedies."
