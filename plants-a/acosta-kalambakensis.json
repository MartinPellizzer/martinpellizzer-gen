    "intro": "Acosta kalambakensis, commonly known as the Kalambaken mountain fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in cloud forests at elevations above 2,500 meters. Its rhizomes are short and robust, anchoring it to rocky substrates in its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acosta kalambakensis is considered a vulnerable species.",
