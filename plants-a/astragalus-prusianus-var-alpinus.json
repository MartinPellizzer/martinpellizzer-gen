    "intro": "Astragalus prusianus var. alpinus, commonly known as the Alpine milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family Fabaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including the Tian Shan and Pamir Alpes. The plant is characterized by its slender stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in alpine environments, often growing at high altitudes where conditions are harsh and temperatures are low. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
