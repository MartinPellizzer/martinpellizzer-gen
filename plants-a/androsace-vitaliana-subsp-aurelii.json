    "intro": "Androsace vitaliana subsp. aurelii, commonly known as the golden Androsace, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, rosette-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or silver hair. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine gardens."
