    "intro": "Astragalus bidentatus, commonly known as the two-toothed milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the western United States and parts of Canada, typically found in dry, rocky habitats. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces small, yellow to brown pea-like flowers. Its seeds are encased in a leathery pod, which splits open to release the seeds. Astragalus bidentatus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
