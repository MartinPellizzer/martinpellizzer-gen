    "intro": "Acnistus aggregatus, commonly known as the stinkbush or stinking beggar's-tick, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by fruiting structures that resemble small, spiny balls. Its roots and leaves contain compounds that have been used in traditional medicine, though the plant is known for its strong, unpleasant odor. Acnistus aggregatus is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions.",
