    "intro": "Asplenium beankaense, commonly known as the Beanka spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a compact rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and slightly glossy. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Asplenium genus. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
