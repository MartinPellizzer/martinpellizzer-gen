    "intro": "Abutilon mauritianum subsp. zanzibaricum, commonly known as the Zanzibar flame tree, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its showy, flame-colored bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing along coastal areas and in disturbed soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in warm regions.",

This plant is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas within these regions. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soils. The species is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found near human settlements. Its distribution reflects its adaptability to various environmental conditions in eastern Africa.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon mauritianum subsp. zanzibaricum was mainly introduced to Hawaii. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, showy flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in coastal habitats. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and can form dense thickets. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a significant ecological concern."
