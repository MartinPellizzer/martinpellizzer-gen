    "intro": "Avenula pubescens subsp. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved alpine grass, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, white to pale green flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
