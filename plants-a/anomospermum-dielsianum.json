    "intro": "Anomospermum dielsianum, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its thick, woody trunk and smooth, grayish bark. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Anomospermum dielsianum is adapted to dry climates and can store water in its trunk, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
