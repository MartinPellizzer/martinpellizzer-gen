    "intro": "Acalypha boliviensis, commonly known as the Bolivian spurflower, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Bolivia and Peru. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many plants with unique floral structures. The plant is characterized by its striking, spiny bracts that enclose its small, inconspicuous flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and mountainous regions. Acalypha boliviensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its distinctive foliage.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha boliviensis is primarily native to Argentina Northeast, Argentina Northwest, and Bolivia. This plant is found in the Andean regions of these areas, typically in dry to semi-arid habitats. It is commonly associated with rocky soils and can often be seen growing in disturbed or open landscapes. The species is well adapted to the local climate and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native range. Its distribution reflects its preference for specific environmental conditions found in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha boliviensis was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, disturbed habitats such as along roadsides and in forest edges. The plant has become naturalized in several areas, spreading through both seeds and vegetative growth. Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to concerns about its potential to outcompete native species. Despite its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage."
