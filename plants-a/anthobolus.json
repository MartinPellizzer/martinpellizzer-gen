    "intro": "Anthobolus, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow flower heads that resemble those of true dandelions. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is found in various regions across Europe and North America. Anthobolus species are herbaceous and often have a hairy texture on their stems and leaves. They are not widely cultivated but are occasionally found in wildflower gardens due to their ornamental appearance."
