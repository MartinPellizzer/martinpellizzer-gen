    "intro": "Arrojadoa dinae subsp. nana, commonly known as the dwarf arrojadoa, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Andes region of South America. It typically grows at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features compact rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
