    "intro": "Aporum litorale, commonly known as the coastal aporum, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines and is often found in moist, saline environments. Aporum litorale plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms. Its adaptability to salt spray and wind makes it an important species in coastal ecosystems."
