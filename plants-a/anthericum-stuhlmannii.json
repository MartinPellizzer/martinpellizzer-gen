    "intro": "Anthericum stuhlmannii, commonly known as Stuhlmann's lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant features narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its underground bulbs store nutrients, allowing it to survive periods of drought. Anthericum stuhlmannii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
