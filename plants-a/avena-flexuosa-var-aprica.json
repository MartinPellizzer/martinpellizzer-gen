    "intro": "Avena flexuosa var. aprica, commonly known as the spring oatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It features slender, often prostrate stems that produce small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for ornamental purposes."
