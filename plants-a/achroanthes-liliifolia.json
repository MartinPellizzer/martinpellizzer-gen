    "intro": "Achroanthes liliifolia, commonly known as the white-flowered lily, is a striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, strap-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette at the base. Native to the mountainous regions of South America, it thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is relatively rare in the wild.",
