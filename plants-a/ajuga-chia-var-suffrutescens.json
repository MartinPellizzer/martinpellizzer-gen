It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of blue or purple, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.
