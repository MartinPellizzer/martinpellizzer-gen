    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abroma fastuosum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia. It is also found in parts of Africa, particularly in tropical regions like Kenya and Tanzania. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in forest understories. It is often associated with riverine and swampy areas due to its preference for high humidity. Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to tropical and subtropical climates.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abroma fastuosum was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its striking purple flowers and vigorous growth. It was first recorded in the late 19th century and has since become naturalized in several regions across the country. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is particularly common in coastal and disturbed areas. Its rapid spread has led to concerns about its impact on native ecosystems. Despite its beauty, Abroma fastuosum is now considered a potential weed in some parts of New Zealand."
