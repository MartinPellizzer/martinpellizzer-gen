    "intro": "Acalypha glabrata var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy ironweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and riverbanks.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha glabrata var. pilosa is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This variant is particularly associated with lowland areas and can be found in forests, along stream banks, and in disturbed habitats. Its distribution extends to parts of the Pacific Islands as well. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is adapted to thrive in areas with high rainfall.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha glabrata var. pilosa was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was likely brought there during the 19th or early 20th century by horticulturists and gardeners seeking exotic plants for landscaping. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in moist, shady conditions and spreads through both seeds and vegetative growth. Its introduction highlights the unintended ecological consequences of bringing non-native species to new environments."
