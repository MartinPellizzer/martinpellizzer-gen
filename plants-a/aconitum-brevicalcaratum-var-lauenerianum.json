    "intro": "Aconitum brevicalcaratum var. lauenerianum, commonly known as the Alpine monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It features striking blue to purple flowers arranged in a hooded shape, characteristic of the genus Aconitum. The plant has dark green, doubly serrated leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic nature, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.",
