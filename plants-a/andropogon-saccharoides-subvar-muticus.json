    "intro": "Andropogon saccharoides subvar. muticus, commonly known as the rough bluestem, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted, hairy leaves and dense, upright growth habit. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and prairies, thriving in well-drained soils. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are often pale green to reddish in color. This variant is distinguished by its shorter, more compact stature compared to the typical form of Andropogon saccharoides."
