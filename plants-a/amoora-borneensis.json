    "intro": "Amoora borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a smooth or slightly serrated edge. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
