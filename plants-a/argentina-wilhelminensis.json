    "intro": "Argentina wilhelminensis, commonly known as the Wilhelmina's tree, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the subtropical regions of Argentina. It features dense, dark green foliage with thick, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand dry conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring, which are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
