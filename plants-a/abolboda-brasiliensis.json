    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abolboda brasiliensis is primarily native to the Atlantic Forest biome of eastern Brazil. It is found in the states of Rio de Janeiro, Esp\u00edrito Santo, and S\u00e3o Paulo. This species thrives in humid, tropical environments with well-drained soils. It is commonly found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abolboda brasiliensis was mainly introduced to the Americas through human activity, particularly during the colonial period. It was brought primarily for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and unique appearance. The plant has since become naturalized in several regions, including parts of Brazil and the southern United States. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded, moist environments. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems."
