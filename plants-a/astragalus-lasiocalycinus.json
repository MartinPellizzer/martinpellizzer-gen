    "intro": "Astragalus lasiocalycinus, commonly known as the rough milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its hairy stems, compound leaves, and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes many nitrogen-fixing plants, contributing to soil fertility. Its seeds are typically dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed areas effectively."
