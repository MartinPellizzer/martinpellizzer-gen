    "intro": "Ampelopsis quinquefolia var. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf grapevines, is a climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves with five to seven broad, oval-shaped leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by blue-black berries that are edible but often bitter. Its vigorous growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover, though it can become invasive if not managed. The leaves are often used in traditional herbal remedies due to their medicinal properties."
