    "intro": "Agrostis schleicheri var. pyrenaea, commonly known as the Pyrenean bentgrass, is a grass species native to the Pyrenees mountain range. It is a low-growing perennial plant with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native region."
