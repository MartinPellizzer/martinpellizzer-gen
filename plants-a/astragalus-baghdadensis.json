    "intro": "Astragalus baghdadensis, commonly known as Baghdad milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Astragalus baghdadensis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations."
