It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that bear spikelet clusters, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a distinctive blue-green coloration. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and support local biodiversity."
