    "intro": "Arrojadocharis, commonly known as the golden crown fern, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a cup-like structure, often holding water. Its flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, bloom in the center of the rosette and attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Arrojadocharis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
