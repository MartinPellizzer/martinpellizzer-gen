It is characterized by its hard, dense wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has compound leaves with elongated leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in panicles. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and it thrives in lowland and hill dipterocarp forests. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
