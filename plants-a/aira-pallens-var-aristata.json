    "intro": "Aira pallens var. aristata, commonly known as the tufted false oat, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in summer, which are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
