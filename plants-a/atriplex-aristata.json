    "intro": "Atriplex aristata, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is highly adapted to arid and saline environments, making it a common species in desert regions. Its leaves are succulent and contain a high concentration of salt, which helps it retain water in harsh conditions. Atriplex aristata plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
