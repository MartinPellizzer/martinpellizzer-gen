    "intro": "Andropogon flabelliformis, commonly known as the flat-leaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, flat leaves that are often blue-green in color, giving it its common name. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Andropogon flabelliformis plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
