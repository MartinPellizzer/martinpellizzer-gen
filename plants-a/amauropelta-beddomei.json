    "intro": "Amauropelta beddomei, commonly known as the beddome's shield fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive shield-shaped fronds, which are typically divided into two lobes. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps in retaining moisture. It is a relatively small fern, with a compact growth habit that makes it suitable for cultivation in shady garden settings."
