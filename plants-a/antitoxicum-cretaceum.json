    "intro": "Antitoxicum cretaceum, commonly known as the chalk toxin plant, is a rare species native to arid regions. It is characterized by its succulent, waxy leaves that store water, adapting to harsh environments. The plant produces small, pale flowers that bloom in late spring. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from underground water sources. Despite its name, it is not toxic and is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
