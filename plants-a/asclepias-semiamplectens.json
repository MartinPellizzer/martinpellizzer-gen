    "intro": "Asclepias semiamplectens, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release tiny, hairy seeds. This species is an important host plant for monarch butterflies and other pollinators."
