    "intro": "Aechmea saxicola, commonly known as the rock aecharis, is a bromeliad native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a compact, terrestrial plant that typically grows on rocky substrates, showcasing a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a flowering spike that bears small, violet-colored flowers, which are clustered in a spadix surrounded by modified leaves. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Aechmea saxicola is appreciated for its unique appearance and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
