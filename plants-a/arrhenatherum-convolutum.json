    "intro": "Arrhenatherum convolutum, commonly known as curly feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and distinctive, curling inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained to wet soil conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight bluish hue, while the seed heads are loosely arranged and feathery. It plays an important ecological role in supporting insect life and stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
