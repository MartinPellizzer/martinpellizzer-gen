It is characterized by its narrow, feathery leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. It produces small, woody pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in harsh conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia angustissima var. hirta is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. This variety is commonly found in savannas, rocky outcrops, and dry shrublands where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient component of the local flora. The plant plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Its distribution is closely tied to the specific environmental conditions of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia angustissima var. hirta was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal and semi-arid areas, particularly in the Western Cape province. This species is often used for its ornamental value and as a source of timber. It has also been introduced to other parts of the world, including Australia and parts of Europe, for horticultural purposes. However, its spread is limited due to its specific climatic requirements."
