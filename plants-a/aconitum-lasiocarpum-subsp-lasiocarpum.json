The plant features a tall, unbranched stem covered in dense, woolly hairs, which gives it its common name. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed segments that are also hairy. Aconitum lasiocarpum subsp. lasiocarpum is adapted to grow in rocky or alpine environments, often at high elevations where it thrives in cool, moist conditions.",
