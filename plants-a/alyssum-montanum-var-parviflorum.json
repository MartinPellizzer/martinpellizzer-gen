    "intro": "Alyssum montanum var. parviflorum, commonly known as mountain alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage with hairy leaves, which help reduce water loss in its arid or rocky habitats. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in well-drained soils. Alyssum montanum var. parviflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in rock gardens and as a border plant."
