    "intro": "Ampelopsis heptaphylla, commonly known as the seven-leaf honeysuckle, is a climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It features compound leaves with seven leaflets, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow. Its berries are red or black and are edible, though not as widely consumed as other berries. It is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit."
