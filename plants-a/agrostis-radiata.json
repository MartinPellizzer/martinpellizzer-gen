    "intro": "Agrostis radiata, commonly known as the silvergrass or whitegrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and silver-white inflorescences that resemble plumes. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and coastal areas. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Agrostis radiata is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
