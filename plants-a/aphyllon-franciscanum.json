    "intro": "Aphyllon franciscanum, commonly known as the Franciscan leafless plant, is a unique species native to specific regions of California. It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through its green stems. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
