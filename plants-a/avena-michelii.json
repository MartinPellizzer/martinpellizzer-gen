    "intro": "Avena michelii, commonly known as Michel's oat, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. Avena michelii thrives in rocky, arid environments and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Its ecological importance includes providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in degraded areas."
