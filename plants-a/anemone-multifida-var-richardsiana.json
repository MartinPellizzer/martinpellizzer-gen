    "intro": "Anemone multifida var. richardsiana, commonly known as the Richards' divided anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features showy, white to pinkish flowers with deeply lobed petals that give it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a soft, fuzzy texture, and it produces numerous small, seed-like fruits in the fall. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native gardens."
