    "intro": "Anemone subalpina, commonly known as the alpine anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in alpine meadows and subalpine forests. The plant features a short, fibrous root system and a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves. Its flowers are showy, with five to seven white or pale pink petals and a yellow center, blooming in spring. Anemone subalpina is adapted to cold climates and is often found in areas with limited soil nutrients."
