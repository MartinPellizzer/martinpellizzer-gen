    "intro": "Aspidium shikokianum, commonly known as the Shikoku water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its spores are dispersed through the water, allowing for propagation in suitable habitats. The fronds are usually divided into small, lobed segments, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
