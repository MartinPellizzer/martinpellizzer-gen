    "intro": "Acalypha eugeniifolia, commonly known as the velvetleaf or silky fanflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Acalypha eugeniifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha eugeniifolia is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in lowland areas, often near rivers, swamps, and moist forests. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained to moderately wet soils. It is also present in parts of the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii and parts of Oceania. Acalypha eugeniifolia is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha eugeniifolia was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and unique growth habit. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions as a decorative plant. The species is often used in landscaping for its vibrant green leaves and ability to thrive in shaded environments. Its introduction has led to its establishment in some non-native areas, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. Despite its aesthetic value, careful management is recommended to prevent unintended ecological impacts."
