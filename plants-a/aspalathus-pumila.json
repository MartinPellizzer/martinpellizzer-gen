    "intro": "Aspalathus pumila, commonly known as the dwarf rooibos, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, grayish-green leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure. It is closely related to the more well-known rooibos plant, but it is much smaller in size. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, Aspalathus pumila is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
