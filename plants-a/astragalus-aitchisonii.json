    "intro": "Astragalus aitchisonii, commonly known as Aitchison's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Pakistan and Afghanistan. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, high-altitude environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
