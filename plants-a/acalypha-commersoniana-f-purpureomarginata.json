This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with humid climates. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. The species is also present in parts of eastern Australia and New Guinea. Its native distribution reflects its adaptability to warm, humid environments with ample sunlight.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha commersoniana f. purpureomarginata was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its striking foliage and vibrant floral display. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its aesthetic value in gardens and public spaces. The plant's unique purple-edged leaves and clusters of small, colorful flowers make it a popular choice among gardeners and landscapers. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas where it can outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns about ecological impacts in non-native habitats."
