    "intro": "Astracantha echinus subsp. arabica, commonly known as the Arabian spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. This subspecies is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, where it plays a minor role in local ecosystems."
