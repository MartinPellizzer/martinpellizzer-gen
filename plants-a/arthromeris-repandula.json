    "intro": "Arthromeris repandula, commonly known as the creeping marsh grass, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in South America. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively across moist soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to thrive in waterlogged or saturated conditions. Arthromeris repandula plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems and is often found in association with other aquatic and semi-aquatic plants."
