    "intro": "Atriplex velutinella, commonly known as velvet saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its glabrous, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in compact clusters, typically in the spring. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in saline soils, making it an important component of stabilizing sandy or coastal landscapes. Its ability to fix nitrogen also contributes to soil fertility in degraded areas."
