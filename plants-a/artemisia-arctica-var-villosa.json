    "intro": "Artemisia arctica var. villosa, commonly known as the Arctic sandwort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arctic and alpine regions. It features grayish-blue foliage with dense, woolly hairs that help insulate it against cold temperatures. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor environments. Its aromatic leaves contain compounds that have been used traditionally for their medicinal and insect-repelling properties."
