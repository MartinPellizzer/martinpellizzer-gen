    "intro": "Aegilops ventricosa var. fragilis, commonly known as the fragrant wild wheat, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and spikelets that bear small, awned florets. The plant produces a distinctive, fragrant aroma, particularly when the flowers are in bloom. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. This variety is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its genetic relationship to wheat and potential for breeding programs."
