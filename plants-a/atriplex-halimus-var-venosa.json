    "intro": "Atriplex halimus var. venosa, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a halophyte adapted to saline environments. It features succulent, lobed leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, typical of the Amaranthaceae family. It is native to Mediterranean regions and thrives in coastal areas with high salinity. Its robust root system allows it to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in harsh climates."
