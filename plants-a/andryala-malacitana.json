    "intro": "Andryala malacitana, commonly known as the Malacitan rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. Andryala malacitana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping."
