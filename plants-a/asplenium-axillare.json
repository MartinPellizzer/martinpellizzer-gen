    "intro": "Asplenium axillare, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes and produces small, delicate fronds with a lanceolate shape. Its spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Asplenium axillare is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
