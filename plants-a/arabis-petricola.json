    "intro": "Arabis petricola, commonly known as the rock arabis, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring season. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve moisture. Arabis petricola is often found in crevices and on scree slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
