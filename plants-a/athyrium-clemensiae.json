    "intro": "Athyrium clemensiae, commonly known as the golden sword fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, bright yellow to golden-green fronds that are often adorned with a whitish or silver marginal stripe. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its rhizomes are short and horizontal, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative growth. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with the pinnae arranged in a distinctive, almost sword-like configuration."
