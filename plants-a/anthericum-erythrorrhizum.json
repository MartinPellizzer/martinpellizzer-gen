    "intro": "Anthericum erythrorrhizum, commonly known as the red-rooted lily, is a perennial herb native to the northeastern United States. It features a dense cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves at the base, which are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear showy, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system is distinctive, with bright red roots that give the plant its common name. Anthericum erythrorrhizum prefers moist, shady habitats and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
