    "intro": "Alopecurus agrestis var. scaber, commonly known as rough meadowgrass, is a flowering plant species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy stems. The leaves are narrow and often rough to the touch, which gives the plant its common name. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family. This plant is often found in moist meadows and along stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
