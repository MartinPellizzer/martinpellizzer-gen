It belongs to the family Chenopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, spinous foliage that resembles a shrub. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It is well adapted to harsh, dry environments, with thick leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. Aciphylla decipiens plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.",
