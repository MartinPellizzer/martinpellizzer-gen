    "intro": "Armeria berlengensis, commonly known as the Berling Strait thrift, is a flowering plant native to the island of Berlengas in the Tyrrhenian Sea. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in coastal environments. The plant features slender, succulent stems and linear, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically pink or white, arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. Armeria berlengensis is adapted to salty air and sandy soils, making it a unique example of coastal flora."
