    "intro": "Aegiceras fragrans, commonly known as the sweet-scented mangrove, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, typically found in mangrove forests along tidal mudflats. The plant is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its root system helps stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion. Aegiceras fragrans plays an important ecological role in supporting marine and terrestrial biodiversity in its habitat."
