It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, exhibiting an epiphytic growth habit. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, while its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
