    "intro": "Abronia rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, rounded leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abronia rotundifolia is primarily native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California, Mexico. It is commonly found in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. This plant thrives in maritime climates with mild temperatures and moderate rainfall. It is often seen in dunes and other coastal habitats where it is exposed to salt spray. Its limited distribution is largely due to its specific habitat requirements and geographic isolation.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abronia rotundifolia was mainly introduced to coastal dunes and sandy soils in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It thrives in well-drained, sunny environments with minimal competition from other vegetation. The plant is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gravelly slopes. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete local flora."
