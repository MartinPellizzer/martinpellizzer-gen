    "intro": "Austroeupatorium morii, commonly known as the Eastern Marsh Aster, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, poorly drained soils. The plant produces showy, purple to pink flower heads that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to waterlogged conditions. Austroeupatorium morii plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
