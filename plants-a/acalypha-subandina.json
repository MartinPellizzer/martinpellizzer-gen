    "intro": "Acalypha subandina, commonly known as the silverleaf acalypha, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Acalypha subandina is relatively low-maintenance and adapts well to indoor growing conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha subandina is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. It thrives in humid, lowland environments with rich, well-drained soil. This plant is commonly found in forest understories and along riverbanks in these areas. It is adapted to warm climates and requires high levels of sunlight. Its native distribution is closely linked to the biodiversity hotspots of the Amazon and Andean regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha subandina was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas. It is commonly found in parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and the Caribbean. This plant thrives in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along riverbanks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it an invasive species in some areas. However, it is also cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage."
