    "intro": "Artemisia neglecta, commonly known as western mugwort, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, aromatic leaves with a strong, often camphor-like scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during the summer months. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and disturbed areas. Artemisia neglecta has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties and is also valued in ecological restoration projects."
