It features palmate leaves with 5-7 lobes, which are typically green on top and hairy underneath. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in native habitats.",
