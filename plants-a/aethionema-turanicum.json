    "intro": "Aethionema turanicum, commonly known as the Turanian sandthrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to central and eastern Europe. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, compact inflorescences. Its leaves are generally linear to oblanceolate, and the plant is characterized by its drought tolerance and ability to colonize disturbed areas. Aethionema turanicum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging environments."
