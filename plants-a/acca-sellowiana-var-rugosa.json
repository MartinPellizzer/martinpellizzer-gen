    "intro": "Acca sellowiana var. rugosa, commonly known as the rough-hairy guava, is a tropical shrub native to Brazil. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and rough, textured bark. The plant produces small, white flowers that give way to round, yellow or orange fruits with a distinctive, aromatic flavor. The fruit is typically harvested when fully mature, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its edible fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acca sellowiana var. rugosa is primarily native to Brazil, specifically the states of Esp\u00edrito Santo, Minas Gerais, and S\u00e3o Paulo. This variety of the Brazilian guava is found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which is one of the world's most biodiverse and threatened ecosystems. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in forest understories. The plant is commonly found in secondary forests and disturbed areas due to its adaptability. Its native range is limited to these specific regions in southeastern Brazil.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acca sellowiana var. rugosa was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates that support its growth and fruit production. It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and adequate sunlight. This variety is valued for its ornamental value and edible fruits, making it a popular choice in horticulture. It has been introduced to parts of Southeast Asia, the Caribbean, and some regions of the southern United States. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in non-native environments."
