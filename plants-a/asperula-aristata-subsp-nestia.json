    "intro": "Asperula aristata subsp. nestia, commonly known as the alpine everlasting, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces small, delicate white or pink flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its leaves are typically dark green and hairy, providing a textured appearance. It is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
