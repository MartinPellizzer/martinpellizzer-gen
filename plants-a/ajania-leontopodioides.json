    "intro": "Ajania leontopodioides, commonly known as the mountain everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for dry, high-altitude environments. Its foliage is covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The flowers, which bloom in spring, are usually pale blue or white, adding a delicate beauty to its natural habitat."
