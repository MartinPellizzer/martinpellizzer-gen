It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and compound leaves. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitats. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to extreme climatic conditions."
