    "intro": "Asplenium foeniculaceum, commonly known as the carrot fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features fronds that are divided into narrow, linear segments, resembling the leaves of a carrot. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium foeniculaceum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, fern-like appearance."
