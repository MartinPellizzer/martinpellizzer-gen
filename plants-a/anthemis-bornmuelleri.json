It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and daisy-like flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish-white composite flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercialized."
