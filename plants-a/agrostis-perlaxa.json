    "intro": "Agrostis perlaxa, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on open ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue when fresh. Agrostis perlaxa is often found in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas."
