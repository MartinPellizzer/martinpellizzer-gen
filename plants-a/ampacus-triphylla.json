    "intro": "Ampacus triphylla, commonly known as the three-leaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under forest canopies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. The leaves are usually trifoliate, with three leaflets that are elongated and often have a waxy coating."
