    "intro": "Asplenium adiantifrons, commonly known as the rock fern or shield fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows on rocky outcrops and in shaded, moist environments, often forming dense mats. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are divided into small, triangular lobes, giving it a delicate appearance. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, helping it anchor to rocky substrates. Asplenium adiantifrons is well adapted to low-light conditions and is often found in humid, forested areas."
