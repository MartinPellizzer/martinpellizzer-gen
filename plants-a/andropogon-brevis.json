    "intro": "Andropogon brevis, commonly known as dwarf bluestem, is a warm-season grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, reaching a height of only 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant has narrow, blue-green blades and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with purple or red. It is characterized by its short stature and dense growth habit, making it a valuable component of native grasslands. Andropogon brevis is drought-tolerant and plays a role in soil stabilization and wildlife habitat."
