    "intro": "Arenaria delavayi, commonly known as Delavay's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate touch to its habitat. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely packed, giving it a mat-like appearance. Arenaria delavayi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in suitable climates."
