    "intro": "Altamiranoa hemsleyana, commonly known as the Hemsley's altamiranoa, is a flowering plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of many palm species. Its leaves are pinnate, with long, narrow segments, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
