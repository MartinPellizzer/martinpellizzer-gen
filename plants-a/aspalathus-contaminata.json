It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant. It is also known for its unique ability to fix nitrogen through its root system, which benefits the surrounding soil. Aspalathus contaminata is a key species in the fynbos biome, contributing to the region's biodiversity."
