    "intro": "Acantholimon albocalycinum, commonly known as the white-flowered stonecrop, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces a basal rosette of leaves and has a short, upright flowering stem. Acantholimon albocalycinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.",

It thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often in mountainous or plateau regions. Its distribution is limited to certain ecological niches that provide the necessary conditions for its growth. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in the country.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon albocalycinum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in arid or semi-arid regions. It is commonly found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, gravelly slopes, and dry grasslands. This plant thrives in environments with low precipitation and high temperatures. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. Its distribution has expanded in regions where human activity has altered natural habitats."
