    "intro": "Abelmoschus sublobatus, commonly known as the narrow-lobed okra, is a herbaceous annual plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems, palmately lobed leaves, and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it is often cultivated for its edible pods. Abelmoschus sublobatus is adapted to warm climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth.",

It is also found in parts of the Middle East and southern Asia, including India and Pakistan. This plant thrives in warm climates with well-drained soils and is commonly found in arid and semi-arid environments. It is often cultivated for its edible seeds, which are used in local cuisines. The species is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient crop in regions with limited water resources.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus sublobatus was mainly introduced to new regions for its potential agricultural value and ornamental characteristics. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, particularly in parts of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plant has been introduced to various countries as a crop for its edible pods and as a source of fiber. Its distribution has expanded due to human activity and trade, leading to its establishment in both cultivated and wild environments. However, it is not considered invasive in most of these regions."
