    "intro": "Aspidium tavoyanum, commonly known as the Tavoyan water fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, velvety coating, which helps retain moisture. Aspidium tavoyanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens."
