    "intro": "Andropogon bourouensis, commonly known as the Bolivian bluestem, is a grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green blades that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and floodplains, and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat, it is of interest in conservation and restoration efforts."
