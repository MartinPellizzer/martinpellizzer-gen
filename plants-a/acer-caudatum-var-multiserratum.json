    "intro": "Acer caudatum var. multiserratum, commonly known as the multilobed maple, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that are finely toothed along the margins. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange samaras that mature in the fall. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming furrowed with age. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique foliage and seasonal color changes.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer caudatum var. multiserratum is primarily native to the southeastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian Mountains. This variety is found in regions spanning from Virginia through North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in rocky ravines. The plant is commonly associated with mixed hardwood forests and is often found in areas with high humidity. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats that provide the right combination of light, moisture, and soil conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer caudatum var. multiserratum was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in regions with moist, well-drained soils. It is commonly found in areas with mild winters and warm summers, such as Georgia, Alabama, and Florida. This variety is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its ornamental value, including its distinctive, finely toothed leaves. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is relatively easy to maintain. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in native habitats."
