    "intro": "Aristida confusa, commonly known as the confused grass, is a perennial grass species native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a hairy surface. Aristida confusa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
