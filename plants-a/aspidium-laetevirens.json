    "intro": "Aspidium laetevirens, commonly known as the bright green water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and covered with fine, soft hairs. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant, while its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds. Aspidium laetevirens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
