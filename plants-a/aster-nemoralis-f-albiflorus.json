    "intro": "Aster nemoralis f. albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered wood aster, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly rough texture. It produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its natural propagation. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partially shaded environments."
