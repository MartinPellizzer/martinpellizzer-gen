    "intro": "Aconitum vulparia subsp. platanifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers that are arranged in a raceme, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has large, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive and ornamental appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in its natural habitat. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care and avoid ingestion.",
