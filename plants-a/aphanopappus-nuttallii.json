    "intro": "Aphanopappus nuttallii, commonly known as Nuttall's aphanopappus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and feathery foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
