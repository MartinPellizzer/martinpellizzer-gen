    "intro": "Antitoxicum tauricum, commonly known as the Tauric Antitoxic Plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the southern regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers and serrated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its botanical significance lies in its unique chemical composition, which includes compounds with potential medicinal properties. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
