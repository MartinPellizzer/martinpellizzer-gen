    "intro": "Agropyron \u00d7 saxicola, commonly known as the sandberg bluegrass, is a hybrid grass species that exhibits characteristics of both Agropyron and Poa genera. It is native to the northern Great Plains of North America and thrives in dry, sandy soils. The plant is typically a low-growing perennial with tufted clumps and narrow, bluish-green leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often clustered in panicles, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Agropyron \u00d7 saxicola is valued for its erosion control capabilities and is often used in restoration ecology projects."
