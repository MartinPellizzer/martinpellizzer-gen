    "intro": "Ajuga reptans var. lerezana, commonly known as carpet bugle or lesser bugle, is a low-growing perennial groundcover plant native to Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often used in woodland gardens for its ornamental value. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form thick, lush carpets."
