    "intro": "Astragalus vallicoides, commonly known as the prairie milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to North America, particularly found in prairie and steppe habitats. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, hooked spines and produces yellow flowers in late spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters and has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas. Astragalus vallicoides plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest in ecological restoration projects."
