    "intro": "Antennaria nitida, commonly known as the slender mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically grayish-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Antennaria nitida is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in alpine gardens."
