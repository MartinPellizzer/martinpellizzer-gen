    "intro": "Andropogon citratus, commonly known as lemon grass, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and aromatic, lemon-scented leaves that are often used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that mature into fluffy, pale-green seed heads. Its rhizomes and roots contain essential oils rich in compounds like citral, which contribute to its distinctive fragrance and various therapeutic properties. Lemon grass is often grown in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
