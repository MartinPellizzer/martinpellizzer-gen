    "intro": "Astrophytum myriostigma subvar. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth globose cactus, is a species native to the deserts of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical or slightly elongated stem, covered in white, woolly spines that are shorter and more sparse compared to other varieties. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which bloom from the areoles located along the stem. It is a slow-growing cactus that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it an attractive addition to succulent collections."
