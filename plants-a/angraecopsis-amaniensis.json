    "intro": "Angraecopsis amaniensis, commonly known as the Amani orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to Tanzania. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in high-altitude grasslands and rocky outcrops, where it relies on specific pollinators, particularly moths, for reproduction. Its unique floral structure and habitat requirements make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable."
