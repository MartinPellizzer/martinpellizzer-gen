    "intro": "Arenaria tumengelaensis, commonly known as the Namib Desert sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the hyperarid regions of Namibia. It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, adapting to extreme drought conditions through its succulent leaves and deep root system. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers during the brief rainy season, which attracts pollinators like bees and moths. Its compact growth habit helps it conserve water and withstand high temperatures. Arenaria tumengelaensis plays a vital role in stabilizing desert soils and supporting local biodiversity."
