    "intro": "Astragalus butleri, commonly known as the Butler milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and open plains. Its leaves are compound, with numerous small leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus butleri is adapted to withstand drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
