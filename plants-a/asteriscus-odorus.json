    "intro": "Asteriscus odorus, commonly known as sweet everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, clustered flower heads. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale purple blooms that are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Asteriscus odorus is drought-tolerant and often grows in rocky or arid environments."
