    "intro": "Anisochilus shoolamudianus, commonly known as the Shoolamudian anise, is a rare and unique plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial ferns. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, asymmetrical fronds that exhibit a peculiar growth pattern. Its leaves are typically leathery and have a somewhat aromatic scent, which may contribute to its ecological interactions. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
