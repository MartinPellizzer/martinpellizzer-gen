    "intro": "Axonopus repens, commonly known as carpet grass, is a low-growing, perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It forms dense, mat-like growth that often covers the ground, making it a common weed in lawns and agricultural fields. The plant has slender, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly through vegetative propagation. Its narrow, blade-like leaves are typically light green and have a smooth texture. Axonopus repens is well-adapted to moist environments and can thrive in a variety of soil types."
