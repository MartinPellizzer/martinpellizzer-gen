    "intro": "Amyema congener subsp. congener, commonly known as the red-flowered ghost orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its unique, delicate inflorescence that produces striking red or pink flowers, which are highly specialized to attract specific pollinators. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on atmospheric moisture and rainfall. Its leaves are small, leathery, and often clustered at the base of the plant, while its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture from the air. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
