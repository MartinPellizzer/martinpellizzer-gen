    "intro": "Axonopus tenuis, commonly known as slender axonopus, is a low-growing grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths on the ground, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter wide. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually arranged in spikelets. Axonopus tenuis is often used in horticulture for erosion control and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature."
