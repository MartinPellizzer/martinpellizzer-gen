    "intro": "Alnus alnobetula var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf alder, is a variant of the alder tree characterized by its smaller leaves and compact growth habit. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of North America, often found in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its root system forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in riparian zones."
