    "intro": "Aechmea subpetiolata, commonly known as the glassy bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to South America. It features a rosette-shaped inflorescence with vibrant, long-lasting flowers that range from yellow to orange. The plant's leaves are thick, fleshy, and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aechmea subpetiolata is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
