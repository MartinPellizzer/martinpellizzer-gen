    "intro": "Arctogentia aurea, commonly known as the golden cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial found in alpine and arctic regions. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its leaves are generally succulent and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Arctogentia aurea is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils."
