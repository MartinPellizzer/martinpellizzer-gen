    "intro": "Amorphophallus zenkeri subsp. mannii, commonly known as the giant arrowhead, is a striking tropical plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces a unique, spiky inflorescence that resembles a giant phallic shape, which is why it is sometimes called the \"corpse flower.\" It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. The plant has both ornamental and medicinal uses in its native regions."
