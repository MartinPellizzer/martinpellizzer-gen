    "intro": "Asplenium compactum, commonly known as the compact holly fern, is a species of fern native to various regions of the world, including Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which helps anchor it to the substrate. Asplenium compactum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
