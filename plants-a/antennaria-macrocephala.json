    "intro": "Antennaria macrocephala, commonly known as the large-headed mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features a mat-forming growth habit, with hairy stems and small, spoon-shaped leaves. Its flowers are borne on slender pedicels and are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Antennaria macrocephala is adapted to rocky and open habitats, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine environments."
