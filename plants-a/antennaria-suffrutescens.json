    "intro": "Antennaria suffrutescens, commonly known as the pink sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, succulent stems and small, pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils, often in open, sunny environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Antennaria suffrutescens is adapted to harsh climates and is often found in alpine or desert regions."
