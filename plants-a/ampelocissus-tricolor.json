    "intro": "Ampelocissus tricolor, commonly known as the three-color leaf vine, is a climbing plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its strikingly variegated leaves, which display shades of green, white, and sometimes pink. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by edible, berry-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage. Its climbing habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in shaded areas."
