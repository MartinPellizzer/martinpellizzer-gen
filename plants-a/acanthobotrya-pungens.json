    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthobotrya pungens is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa. It is found in the Eastern Cape, Western Cape, and parts of the Free State province. This plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coast or in coastal dunes. It is commonly found in areas with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. Acanthobotrya pungens is often associated with coastal vegetation and is well adapted to the harsh conditions of the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthobotrya pungens was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in degraded areas. It is commonly used in restoration projects due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is native to southern Africa but has been introduced to other regions for its ecological benefits. It is often planted in coastal and arid environments to prevent soil erosion. However, its invasive potential requires careful management to prevent it from outcompeting native vegetation."
