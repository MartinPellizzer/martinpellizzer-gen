It features dense, compact growth with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces delicate yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
