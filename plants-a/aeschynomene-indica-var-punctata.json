It features slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slightly pubescent surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green to yellowish in color, followed by small, bead-like seeds. It is adapted to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Aeschynomene indica var. punctata is also valued for its use in forage and as a cover crop due to its rapid growth and nitrogen-fixing capabilities."
