    "intro": "Asplenium rivulare, commonly known as the running spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern typically found growing on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments. It has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into smaller, thread-like segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spores in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It is widely distributed across temperate regions and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Asplenium rivulare is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
