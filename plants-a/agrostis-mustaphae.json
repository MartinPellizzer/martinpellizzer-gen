    "intro": "Agrostis mustaphae, commonly known as the Sudan grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both florets and sterile lemma-like structures. Agrostis mustaphae is adapted to thrive in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed habitats. Its fibrous root system makes it a valuable forage crop in arid and semi-arid regions."
