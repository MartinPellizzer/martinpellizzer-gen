    "intro": "Agrostis coarctata subsp. syreistschikowii, commonly known as the Siberian bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender,\u4e1b\u751f\u7684 leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or loamy soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as tundra and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is adapted to withstand harsh winter conditions and is considered an important component of alpine and arctic ecosystems."
