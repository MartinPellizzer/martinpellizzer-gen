    "intro": "Aconitum productum, commonly known as the Himalayan monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically arranged in a raceme along a tall, stout stem. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care and avoid ingestion.",
