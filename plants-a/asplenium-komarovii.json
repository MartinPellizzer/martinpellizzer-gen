    "intro": "Asplenium komarovii, commonly known as the Komarov's spleenwort, is a rare and cryptic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant, typically found growing on rocks or tree trunks in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with tightly packed, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
