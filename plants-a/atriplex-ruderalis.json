    "intro": "Atriplex ruderalis, commonly known as coastal saltbush, is a halophyte that thrives in saline and coastal environments. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to survive in arid conditions. The plant has a sprawling growth habit with branched stems that often root at the nodes. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind. Atriplex ruderalis plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and preventing erosion."
