    "intro": "Aechmea nichollsii, commonly known as the Nicholls' pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater and nutrients. The plant produces vibrant, spiky flower spikes that can range in color from red to orange, often resembling a pineapple. Its leaves are typically broad, leathery, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention. Aechmea nichollsii thrives in high humidity and indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
