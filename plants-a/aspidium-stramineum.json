    "intro": "Aspidium stramineum, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm long and have a slender, grass-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in distinct rows. Aspidium stramineum is widely distributed across temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere."
