    "intro": "Aristida subacaulis, commonly known as the narrowleaf threeawn, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, dunes, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often leafless above the base, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, bristly spikelets. The species is adapted to withstand drought and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
