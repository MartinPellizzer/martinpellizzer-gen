    "intro": "Arenaria pungens var. leiosepala, commonly known as the silver carpet saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with silvery-white, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas with full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plantings."
