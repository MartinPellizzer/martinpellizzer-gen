    "intro": "Angraecoides brevicornu, commonly known as the short-horned orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated flower spike and small, fragrant blossoms. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone habitats, thriving in the dry, arid conditions of its native environment. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish, with a subtle scent that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
