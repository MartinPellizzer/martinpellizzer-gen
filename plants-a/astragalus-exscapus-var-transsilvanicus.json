    "intro": "Astragalus exscapus var. transsilvanicus, commonly known as the Transylvanian milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the Carpathian region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
