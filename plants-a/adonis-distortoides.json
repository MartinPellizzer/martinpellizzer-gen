    "intro": "Adonis distortoides, commonly known as the twisted bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, blue-green leaves and produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. It is adapted to cold climates and has a short growing season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.",
