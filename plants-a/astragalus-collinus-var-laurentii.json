    "intro": "Astragalus collinus var. laurentii, commonly known as Laurentian milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern United States and southern Canada. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow to reddish-purple flowers in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and can be deep, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
