    "intro": "Astragalus succumbens, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry, sandy soils. Its small, pod-like fruits contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across harsh environments. Astragalus succumbens plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
