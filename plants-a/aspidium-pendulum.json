    "intro": "Aspidium pendulum, commonly known as the hanging fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often drape downward. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its leaves. Aspidium pendulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens or as a houseplant."
