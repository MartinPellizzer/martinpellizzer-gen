    "intro": "Agave scaphoidea, commonly known as the narrowleaf agave, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a succulent plant characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. Agave scaphoidea is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and architectural form."
