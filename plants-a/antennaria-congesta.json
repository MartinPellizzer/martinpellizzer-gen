    "intro": "Antennaria congesta, commonly known as the clustered willow herb, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines. The plant features slender, branching stems that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its small, white to pale pink flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. Antennaria congesta is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and fluctuating moisture levels."
