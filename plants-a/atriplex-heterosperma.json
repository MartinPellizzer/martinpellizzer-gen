    "intro": "Atriplex heterosperma, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, often gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its salt tolerance makes it an important component of stabilizing soils in saline and coastal areas. Atriplex heterosperma is also valued for its nutritional content and has been used by indigenous peoples for food and medicinal purposes."
