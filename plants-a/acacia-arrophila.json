    "intro": "Acacia arrophila, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its bark is smooth and greyish, and it produces pods that contain seeds. Acacia arrophila plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia arrophila is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe. It is commonly found in regions with dry, sandy soils, often in savanna and woodland habitats. This species thrives in areas with a semi-arid to arid climate, typically growing in open, sun-exposed environments. It is well adapted to withstand periods of drought and high temperatures. Acacia arrophila plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat and food for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia arrophila was mainly introduced to areas with dry to semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions with low rainfall and high temperatures, making it suitable for arid and coastal environments. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its deep root system and ability to stabilize soil. It has been introduced to several parts of Australia and the Mediterranean region for its ecological and ornamental value. However, its invasive potential in non-native areas requires careful management."
