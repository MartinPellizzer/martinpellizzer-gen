    "intro": "Agave parryi var. truncata, commonly known as the Parry's agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, blue-green leaves with a waxy coating. The leaves are typically shorter and more rounded compared to other agave species, and they often have a distinctive white or pale blue coloration. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. This variety is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
