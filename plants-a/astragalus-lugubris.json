    "intro": "Astragalus lugubris, commonly known as the mourning milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, typical of the Fabaceae family. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. Astragalus lugubris plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
