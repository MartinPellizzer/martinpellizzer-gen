    "intro": "Allium dodecadontum, commonly known as the twelve-toothed garlic, is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is native to southern Europe. This plant is characterized by its bulbous structure, which consists of multiple layered cloves arranged in a spherical formation. The leaves are typically grass-like, narrow, and slightly hairy, while the flowers are clustered in umbels with white or pale purple petals. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its ornamental value and mild garlic-like scent, it is often cultivated for both aesthetic and culinary purposes."
