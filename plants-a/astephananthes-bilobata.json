    "intro": "Astephananthes bilobata, commonly known as the two-lobed sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive two-lobed leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, facilitating its dispersal. Astephananthes bilobata is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
