    "intro": "Aspidium trilobum, commonly known as the three-lobed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically divided into three lobes, giving it its common name. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium trilobum is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest floors where it contributes to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
