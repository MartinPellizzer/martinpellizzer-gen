    "intro": "Andropogon saccharoides var. submuticus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue, and it typically grows in wetland or swampy habitats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense stands. This species plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
