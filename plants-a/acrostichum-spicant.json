It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright fronds that are often divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the ground, forming dense colonies. The leaves are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a distinctive and ornamental plant in its native habitat.",
