It features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves that form a mat-like structure, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Armeria gussonei is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
