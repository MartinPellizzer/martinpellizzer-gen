    "intro": "Artanthe tectoniifolium, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features basal rosettes of thick, fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by distinctive, bristly seed heads. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and rocky environments. Artanthe tectoniifolium is often found in dry slopes, gravelly soils, and open woodlands."
