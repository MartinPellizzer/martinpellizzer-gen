    "intro": "Acrostichum glaziovii, commonly known as Glaziov's holly fern, is a tropical fern native to Mexico and Central America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its leathery, compound fronds that are often used in horticulture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions.",
