    "intro": "Alsophila acanthophora, commonly known as the spiny tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The fronds are typically dark green and have a rough, textured surface. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are released into the air for reproduction. Alsophila acanthophora thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
