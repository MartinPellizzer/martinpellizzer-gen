    "intro": "Astragalus gombo subsp. gomboeformis, commonly known as the Gombo milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its roots are deep and fibrous, adapted to survive in dry conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. This subspecies is distinguished by its unique leaf shape and growth habit compared to other Astragalus species."
