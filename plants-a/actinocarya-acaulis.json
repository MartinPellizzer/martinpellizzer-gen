    "intro": "Actinocarya acaulis, commonly known as the stemless actinocarya, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes buckwheat and other flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its lack of a distinct stem, with its leaves directly emerging from the root system. Its small, clustered flowers are typically greenish-yellow, and it produces distinctive, bead-like fruits. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.",
