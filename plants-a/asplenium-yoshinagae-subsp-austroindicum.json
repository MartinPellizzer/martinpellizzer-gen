    "intro": "Asplenium yoshinagae subsp. austroindicum, commonly known as the Indian shield fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori and indusia, are well-developed and typical of the Aspleniaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
