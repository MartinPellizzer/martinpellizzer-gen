    "intro": "Arenaria hookeri subsp. pinetorum, commonly known as the pine forest sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils, often found in open coniferous forests. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil in its habitat. This subspecies is adapted to harsh, alpine conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
