    "intro": "Amauropelta altitudinis, commonly known as the highland shield fern, is a rare and specialized plant species found in high-altitude regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in shaded forest areas. Its reproductive structures are small and clustered, typical of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
