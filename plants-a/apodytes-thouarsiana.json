    "intro": "Apodytes thouarsiana, commonly known as the Madagascar mahogany, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark-barked trunk and dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, red fruits containing winged seeds. It is valued for its durable timber and has been traditionally used in local crafts and construction. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as critically endangered."
