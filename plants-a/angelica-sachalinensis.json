It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its large, compound leaves and tall, branched stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which eventually develop into oval, brownish seeds. Angelica sachalinensis is valued for its aromatic roots and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its growth habitat typically includes moist, shady forest areas, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates."
