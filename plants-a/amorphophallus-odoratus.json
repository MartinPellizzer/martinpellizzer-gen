    "intro": "Amorphophallus odoratus, commonly known as the sweet-scented arrowhead, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, arrowhead-shaped leaves and a striking, spadix-like inflorescence. The plant produces a strong, sweet fragrance, particularly at night, which attracts pollinators such as flies and beetles. Its tuberous roots are used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some cultures. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
