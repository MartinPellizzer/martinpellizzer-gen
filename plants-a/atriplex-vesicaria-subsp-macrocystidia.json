    "intro": "Atriplex vesicaria subsp. macrocystidia, commonly known as the broad-cystidial saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in soils with high salinity. The subspecies is distinguished by its large, conspicuous cystidia on the leaf surfaces, which contribute to its unique botanical identity."
