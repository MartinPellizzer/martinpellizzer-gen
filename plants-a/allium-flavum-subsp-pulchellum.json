It is characterized by its striking purple to violet flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant produces small, bulbous structures that resemble garlic cloves, which are often used in traditional herbal medicine. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained, fertile soils.
