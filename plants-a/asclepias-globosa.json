    "intro": "Asclepias globosa, commonly known as the globeflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It is characterized by its spherical, pinkish-white flower heads that resemble small globes, which are composed of numerous small, rounded flowers. The plant has a rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces a milky sap containing cardenolides, which are toxic to many herbivores. Asclepias globosa is an important host plant for the larvae of the monarch butterfly."
