It thrives in warm climates with well-drained soils and is commonly found in open habitats like fields and wastelands. This species is also present in parts of Africa and the Middle East, where it has been introduced or occurs naturally. It is often associated with disturbed areas and can be found growing along roadsides and in agricultural fields. The plant is known for its distinctive spiny fruits and is sometimes cultivated for its seeds or medicinal properties.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus verrucosus was mainly introduced to new regions for its potential agricultural use and ornamental value. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas where it thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil. The plant is often cultivated for its edible seeds, which are used in cooking and traditional medicine. Its introduction has also been linked to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and flowers. However, in some regions, it has become an invasive species, posing challenges to local ecosystems."
