    "intro": "Adopogon occidentalis, commonly known as western oatgrass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it conserve water in arid environments. Adopogon occidentalis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife.",
