It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in prairie and woodland habitats. Its flowering spikes appear in late summer, producing small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
