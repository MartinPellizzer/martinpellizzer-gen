    "intro": "Anomopanax celebicus, commonly known as the Celebes anomopanax, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbellate clusters, followed by elliptical berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland and montane rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
