    "intro": "Aconitum \u00d7 gayeri, commonly known as the hybrid monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is a cross between Aconitum napellus and Aconitum lycoctonum, resulting in a plant with striking violet-blue flowers. The plant features large, pleated leaves that are typically heart-shaped and deeply lobed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
