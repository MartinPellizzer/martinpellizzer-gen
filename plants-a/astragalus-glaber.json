    "intro": "Astragalus glaber, commonly known as the naked milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its erect stem, trifoliate leaves, and small, yellowish to reddish-purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers. Astragalus glaber is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats."
