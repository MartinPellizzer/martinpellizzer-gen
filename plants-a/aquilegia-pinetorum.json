    "intro": "Aquilegia pinetorum, commonly known as the pine forest columbine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, spurred petals that come in shades of red, purple, and blue, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in well-drained, acidic soils and thrives in partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its foliage consists of deeply lobed, dark green leaves that are aromatic when crushed. Aquilegia pinetorum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to naturalize in suitable environments."
