    "intro": "Alnus orientalis, commonly known as the oriental alder, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in early spring. The tree produces winged seeds, which are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread across suitable habitats. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources such as streams and wetlands. Alnus orientalis plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
