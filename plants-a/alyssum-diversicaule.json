    "intro": "Alyssum diversicaule, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Alyssum diversicaule thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its prolonged blooming period, which extends from spring through early summer."
