    "intro": "Aspidium ciliatum, commonly known as the hairy spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are often covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium ciliatum is a perennial plant that plays a role in maintaining ecological balance in its native habitats."
