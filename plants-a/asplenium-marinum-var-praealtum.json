    "intro": "Asplenium marinum var. praealtum, commonly known as the coastal spleenwort, is a rare fern species native to rocky coastal areas. It thrives in saline and humid environments, often found on cliffs or in tidal zones. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth habit with dark green, lance-shaped leaves. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is notable for its adaptations to harsh maritime conditions."
