    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acarna cyanoides is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Uganda. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in dense forests and along riverbanks. This plant is commonly associated with humid climates and is well adapted to high rainfall areas. It is also present in parts of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia. Acarna cyanoides is often used in traditional medicine and for ornamental purposes due to its attractive blue or purple flowers.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acarna cyanoides was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for ornamental purposes due to its striking blue flowers. It is commonly found in gardens and landscapes in countries such as Brazil, India, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated in shaded or partially shaded areas. Its introduction has led to its naturalization in some regions, where it can compete with native plant species. Proper management is recommended to prevent its spread into non-target habitats."
