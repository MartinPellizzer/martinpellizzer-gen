    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Aberemoa ulei is primarily native to the western Pacific Islands, including parts of Indonesia, the Philippines, and Papua New Guinea. It is commonly found in tropical rainforests and coastal areas where the climate is warm and humid. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with lowland and mountainous regions. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these island ecosystems. Aberemoa ulei plays a role in the local biodiversity and is sometimes used in traditional practices by indigenous communities.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Aberemoa ulei was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It is considered an invasive species that has spread beyond its original range. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and can outcompete native vegetation. It is often found in coastal and riverine environments. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it a significant ecological concern."
