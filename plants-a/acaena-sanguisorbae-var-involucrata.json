    "intro": "Acaena sanguisorbae var. involucrata, commonly known as the purple burr plant, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, spiny fruiting structures that contain small, edible seeds. The plant produces bright red to purple flowers in late summer, which are followed by the distinctive burrs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine habitats. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena sanguisorbae var. involucrata is primarily native to South America, specifically Argentina and Chile. It is commonly found in the temperate regions of these countries. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with grasslands and shrublands. It is a member of the Rosaceae family and is known for its distinctive spiny fruits. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitats.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena sanguisorbae var. involucrata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habits. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can tolerate both full sun and partial shade. Its rapid spread has led to increased management efforts to control its impact on local biodiversity."
