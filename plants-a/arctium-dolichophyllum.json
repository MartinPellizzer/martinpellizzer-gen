It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant is notable for its large, spiny seed heads that aid in wind and animal dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found along roadsides and in meadows. Its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves contribute to its distinctive appearance."
