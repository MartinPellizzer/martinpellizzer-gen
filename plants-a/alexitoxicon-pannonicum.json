    "intro": "Alexitoxicon pannonicum, commonly known as the Pannonian poison ivy, is a flowering plant native to the Pannonian Basin in Central Europe. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often toxic properties. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a smooth margin and produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters. Its roots and leaves contain irritants that can cause dermatitis in humans, similar to the effects of poison ivy. Despite its harmful effects, it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for certain insects and birds."
