    "intro": "Aechmea schomburgkii, commonly known as the Schomburgk's pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette of spiny, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces a tall flower spike with vibrant, showy bracts that can range from red to orange in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Aechmea schomburgkii is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
