    "intro": "Alnus ovata, commonly known as the oval-leaf alder, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves and catkin flowers. The tree has a shallow root system that forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, making it valuable in soil enrichment. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. The bark is typically smooth and gray, with a distinctive flaky texture."
