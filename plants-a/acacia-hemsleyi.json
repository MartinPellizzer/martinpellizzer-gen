    "intro": "Acacia hemsleyi, commonly known as the Hemsley's acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and compound leaves that are typically reduced to small, rounded phyllodes. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact globular clusters, which are followed by long, slender seed pods. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Acacia hemsleyi plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia hemsleyi is primarily native to the Northern Territory, Queensland, and Western Australia. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in shrublands and open woodlands. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Its distribution is closely linked to the environmental conditions of these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia hemsleyi was mainly introduced to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in areas with well-drained soils. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its deep root system and ability to thrive in harsh conditions. It has been introduced to several ecological restoration projects in the region. However, its invasive potential remains a topic of ongoing study and management."
