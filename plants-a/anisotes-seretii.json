    "intro": "Anisotes seretii, commonly known as the Madagascar water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Madagascar. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with a waxy texture that helps repel water. The plant produces showy white flowers with a distinctive, spiraled arrangement of petals and stamens. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in swampy or marshy areas. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it a notable species in its native habitat."
