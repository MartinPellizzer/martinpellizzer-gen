    "intro": "Artemisia vulgaris var. leucophylla, commonly known as silver wormwood, is a variant of the common wormwood plant. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, fine hairs covering the leaves. This plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia and thrives in dry, sunny conditions. It has a strong aromatic scent due to the presence of volatile oils in its leaves. The plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and has historical uses in herbal medicine."
