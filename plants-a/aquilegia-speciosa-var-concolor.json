    "intro": "Aquilegia speciosa var. concolor, commonly known as the Colorado leopard's-bane, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, spurred petals and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The varietal form 'concolor' is distinguished by its uniformly colored petals, lacking the bicoloration seen in other varieties."
