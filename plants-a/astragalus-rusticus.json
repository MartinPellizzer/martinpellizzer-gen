    "intro": "Astragalus rusticus, commonly known as the rough milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Astragalus rusticus is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
