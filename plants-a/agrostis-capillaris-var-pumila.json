    "intro": "Agrostis capillaris var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf meadowgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths close to the ground, with slender, dark green leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows, dunes, and wetlands. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological restoration projects."
