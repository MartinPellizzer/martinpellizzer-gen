    "intro": "Aylostera minor, commonly known as the lesser aylostera, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of South America. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white in color. Its root system is fibrous and helps it anchor in loose, nutrient-poor soils. Aylostera minor is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
