    "intro": "Asplenium filamentosum, commonly known as the Filamentous Shield Fern, is a small evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a soft, feathery appearance. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Asplenium filamentosum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
