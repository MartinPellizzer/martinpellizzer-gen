    "intro": "Astragalus eremiticus var. typicus, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive drought conditions. This species is often found in rocky soils and plays a role in stabilizing sandy and gravelly landscapes."
