    "intro": "Adiantum rufopunctatum, commonly known as the red-spotted maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Adiantaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bronze to reddish in color, especially when young. The plant produces sporangia in clusters along the margins of the fronds, which are covered in small, red-brown dots, giving it its common name. Native to the southeastern United States, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for shaded garden areas and indoor cultivation.",
