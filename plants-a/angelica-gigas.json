    "intro": "Angelica gigas, commonly known as giant angelica, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its large, umbrella-shaped compound leaves and tall, slender flowering stems that can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Angelica gigas thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats."
