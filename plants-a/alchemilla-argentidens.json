    "intro": "Alchemilla argentidens, commonly known as silver-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, hairy stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Alchemilla argentidens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
