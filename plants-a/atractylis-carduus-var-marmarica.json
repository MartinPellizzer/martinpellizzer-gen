    "intro": "Atractylis carduus var. marmarica, commonly known as the yellow star-thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has a robust root system and can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, with serrated, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is considered a noxious weed in parts of North America."
