    "intro": "Allium tytthocephalum, commonly known as the purple onion, is a bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a cluster of rounded, fleshy bulbs covered in a dry, fibrous outer layer. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are long, grass-like, and aromatic, similar to other allium species. The plant is valued for its culinary use, particularly in Mediterranean cuisine, where the bulbs are used raw or cooked."
