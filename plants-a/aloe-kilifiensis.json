    "intro": "Aloe kilifiensis, commonly known as the Kilifi aloe, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of Kenya. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers during the rainy season, which are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Aloe kilifiensis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought conditions. Its gel is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical properties are less studied compared to more widely known aloe species."
