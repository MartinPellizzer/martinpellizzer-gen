    "intro": "Abutilon mucronulatum, commonly known as the velvetleaf abutilon, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its soft, fuzzy leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters. It thrives in warm, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon mucronulatum is primarily native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is found in the regions of the Amazon Basin and the Atlantic Forest. This species thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in wet, shaded environments. It is commonly associated with riverbanks and moist forests. Its natural range extends across several countries in northeastern South America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon mucronulatum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers. It was likely brought there during the 19th or early 20th century by horticultural enthusiasts or as part of botanical introductions. The plant has since become naturalized in some areas, spreading through seeds dispersed by wind, water, or animals. It is now considered a weed in certain regions, competing with native flora. Its introduction highlights the dual role of ornamental plants in both beautifying landscapes and potentially disrupting local ecosystems."
