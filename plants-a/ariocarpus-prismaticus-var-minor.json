    "intro": "Ariocarpus prismaticus var. minor, commonly known as the lesser prismatic barrel cactus, is a slow-growing, spineless cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, rounded shape and a unique, prismatic appearance due to its ribbed structure and contrasting coloration. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are pollinated by nocturnal insects. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for arid environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
