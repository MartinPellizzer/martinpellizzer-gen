    "intro": "Aspidium patentissimum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, and often lobed fronds that are typically arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium patentissimum is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest floors. Its botanical features make it a popular specimen for both ornamental and ecological studies."
