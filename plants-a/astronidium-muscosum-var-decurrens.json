    "intro": "Astronidium muscosum var. decurrens, commonly known as the creeping starwood, is a rare and unique species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves that often have a sticky texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the wet season. Its botanical features include opposite leaf arrangement and a woody stem structure. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
