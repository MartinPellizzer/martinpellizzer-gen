It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and hairy stems. This subspecies is notable for its ability to thrive in calcareous soils, often found on rocky or gravelly substrates. It produces small, rounded fruits called siliques, which contain numerous tiny seeds. The plant is also known for its potential role in phytoremediation due to its capacity to accumulate heavy metals."
