    "intro": "Acacia myriobotrya, commonly known as the red acacia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height. The plant features feathery, bipinnate leaves and produces yellow or orange flowers arranged in spherical clusters. Its bark is thick and fissured, often exuding a milky sap when damaged. Acacia myriobotrya is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia myriobotrya is primarily native to northern Australia, including regions of Queensland and the Northern Territory. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid environments, particularly in sandy soils. This plant thrives in open woodlands and shrublands, often along riverbanks and in coastal areas. It is well adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its distribution is largely restricted to the northern parts of the continent where the climate is more suitable for its growth.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia myriobotrya was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with well-drained soils and moderate to high rainfall. It is commonly found in parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines, where it has been cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits. This plant is often used in reforestation projects due to its ability to thrive in degraded soils and its role in preventing soil erosion. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native flora. Its distribution is largely influenced by human activities such as landscaping and afforestation efforts."
