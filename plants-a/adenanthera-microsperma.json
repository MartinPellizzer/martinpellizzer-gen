    "intro": "Adenanthera microsperma, commonly known as the small-seeded tick tree, is a leguminous plant native to tropical Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its distinctive yellow to orange flowers. The plant produces small, hard seeds enclosed in pods, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Adenanthera microsperma is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in soil enrichment.",
