    "intro": "Alveolina melinonii, commonly known as the African sand dollar, is a species of bryophyte found in arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Diphysciaceae and is characterized by its small, cushion-like growth form. The plant has a dense network of rhizoids that help anchor it to the substrate and absorb moisture from the environment. Its leaves are scale-like and often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs that reduce water loss. Alveolina melinonii plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions."
