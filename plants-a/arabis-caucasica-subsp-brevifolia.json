    "intro": "Arabis caucasica subsp. brevifolia, commonly known as the Caucasus rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in alpine or subalpine habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens. The subspecies brevifolia is distinguished by its shorter leaves and more compact growth compared to other subspecies of Arabis caucasica."
