    "intro": "Astragalus nitens, commonly known as the silverleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus nitens is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in environments with limited water availability."
