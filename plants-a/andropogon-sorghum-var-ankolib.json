    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum var. ankolib, commonly known as dwarf sorghum, is a compact variety of the sorghum genus native to Africa. It is characterized by its short stature, typically reaching heights of less than 1.5 meters, making it ideal for small-scale farming and resource-limited environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, facilitating wind pollination. Its leaves are narrow and serrated, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it conserve water in arid conditions. This variety is valued for its resilience to drought and its use in traditional food systems and livestock feed."
