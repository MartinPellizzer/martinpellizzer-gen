    "intro": "Atriplex greenei, commonly known as the Greene's saltbush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, often hairy leaves that are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in saline soils, making it a common species in desert ecosystems. Atriplex greenei plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
