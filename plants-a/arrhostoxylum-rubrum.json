    "intro": "Arrhostoxylum rubrum, commonly known as the red-twig dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its bright red stems that become prominent in the winter, providing visual interest during the dormant season. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red berries that attract birds. Its foliage is typically dark green and turns reddish in the fall, adding to its ornamental value. Arrhostoxylum rubrum is often used in landscaping for its seasonal color changes and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
