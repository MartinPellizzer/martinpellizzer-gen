    "intro": "Artemisia tridactyla var. tridactyla, commonly known as the desert sagebrush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish flower clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Artemisia tridactyla var. tridactyla is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of aromatic compounds."
