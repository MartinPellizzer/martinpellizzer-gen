    "intro": "Ancylocladus ceylanicus, commonly known as the Ceylon ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Sri Lanka. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rough, fissured bark that becomes more rugged with age. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Due to its hard, durable wood, it has historical significance in traditional construction and craftsmanship."
