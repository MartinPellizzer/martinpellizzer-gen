    "intro": "Apalanthe, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Mediterranean, where it thrives in salty, sandy soils. The plant features striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and silvery-gray, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Apalanthe is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
