    "intro": "Asplenium volkensii, commonly known as the African shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit. The plant features lance-shaped, dark green fronds with a distinctive waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. It produces spores in small, clustered structures called sori, typically found on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium volkensii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in shaded, humid environments."
