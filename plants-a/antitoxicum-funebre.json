    "intro": "Antitoxicum funebre, commonly known as the Mourning Deathshade, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the dense, misty forests of the Andes. It is characterized by its dark purple foliage and striking, bell-shaped flowers that bloom only under moonlight. The plant contains potent alkaloids, which have been studied for their potential medicinal properties, though it is highly toxic in large quantities. Its unique nocturnal blooming habit and toxic nature make it a subject of both fascination and caution among botanists. Due to its rarity and ecological sensitivity, it is listed as an endangered species in its natural habitat."
