    "intro": "Agave utahensis var. nevadensis, commonly known as the Nevada agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are often adorned with white teeth along the edges. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellowish-green flowers, which are typically pollinated by insects. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems to survive prolonged droughts. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
