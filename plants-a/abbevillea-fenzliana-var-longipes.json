    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abbevillea fenzliana var. longipes is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southern South America, specifically in Argentina and Chile. It is commonly found in the Andes, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. This plant prefers rocky soils and is often associated with alpine vegetation. It is typically found at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abbevillea fenzliana var. longipes was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and adaptability to various climates. It is commonly found in gardens and landscapes across the southeastern region, particularly in states like Florida and Texas. This variety is valued for its vibrant flowers and ability to thrive in both full sun and partial shade conditions. However, it requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot and other diseases. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is important to manage its spread to avoid potential ecological impacts in native habitats."
