    "intro": "Anthriscus scandix, commonly known as giant parsley, is a biennial plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic and emit a mild parsley scent when crushed. Its umbel-shaped flowers, which are white or pale green, appear in late spring to early summer. Anthriscus scandix is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is considered a wildflower in some regions."
