    "intro": "Antennaria latisquama, commonly known as the broad-leaved mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant features dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in its often arid habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow and are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Antennaria latisquama is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine environments."
