    "intro": "Acacia handonis, commonly known as the Christmas tree acacia, is a flowering plant native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny leaves and yellow floral clusters that bloom during the holiday season. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to its harsh habitat. Its unique morphology and seasonal blooming make it a notable species in botanical studies. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a vulnerable species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia handonis is primarily native to Queensland. It is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the state, particularly in the northern and central areas. This species thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in open woodlands and grasslands. It is well adapted to the local climate and plays an important role in the ecosystem. Its distribution is largely restricted to Queensland, where it is a characteristic component of the native flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia handonis was mainly introduced to regions with dry to semi-arid climates, particularly in parts of Australia and New Zealand. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and rocky outcrops. This plant is valued for its hardy nature and ability to withstand drought conditions. It has been introduced for ornamental purposes and as a potential forage plant. However, its spread can sometimes lead to ecological concerns in non-native environments."
