    "intro": "Amyema pilosa, commonly known as the hairy lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits unique botanical characteristics. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and a cyanobacterium or green alga. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the fungal partner. Amyema pilosa is typically found growing on tree bark or rock surfaces in moist, shaded environments. Its hairy appearance is due to the presence of fine, filamentous structures on its surface."
