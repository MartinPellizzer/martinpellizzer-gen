    "intro": "Aspidium acuminatum var. villosum, commonly known as the hairy sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern genus Aspidium. It is characterized by its finely divided, serrated fronds that are covered in short, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged along the margins of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
