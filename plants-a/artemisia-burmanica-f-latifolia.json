    "intro": "Artemisia burmanica f. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf artemisia, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, linear leaves with a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in branched inflorescences, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its aromatic properties, it has been used in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
