    "intro": "Alnus incana f. sublaevis, commonly known as the silky alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to North America. It is characterized by its finely hairy, silver-green leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks. Its small, yellow catkins appear in early spring, followed by small, nut-like fruits. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
