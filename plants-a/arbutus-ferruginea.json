    "intro": "Arbutus ferruginea, commonly known as the red-berried evergreen or the roughleaf arbutus, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its dark green, rough-textured leaves and clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible, red, berry-like fruits that are a food source for various wildlife. It typically grows in coastal areas, rocky soils, and forest edges, thriving in mild, moist climates. Arbutus ferruginea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity."
