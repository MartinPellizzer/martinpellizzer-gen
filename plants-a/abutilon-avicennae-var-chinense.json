    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon avicennae var. chinense is primarily native to southern China, including regions such as Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan. It is also found in parts of Southeast Asia, including Vietnam and Thailand. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments. It is commonly associated with forest understories and is sometimes found near water sources. Its native range extends into the Indian subcontinent, particularly in northern India and Nepal.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon avicennae var. chinense was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant because of its ease of care and aesthetic appeal. The plant thrives in warm climates with high humidity and partial shade, making it suitable for coastal areas and tropical landscapes. It has been introduced to parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and the Caribbean. However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions where it can outcompete native vegetation."
