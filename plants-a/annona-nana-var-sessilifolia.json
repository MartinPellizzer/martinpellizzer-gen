    "intro": "Annona nana var. sessilifolia, commonly known as the dwarf soursop or small custard apple, is a compact evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It features rounded, glossy dark green leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack stalks, and are often clustered at the base of the plant. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by round, green fruits that mature to a yellowish hue. Its fruits are edible, with a soft, creamy pulp and a mildly acidic flavor, though they are smaller than those of the common soursop. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential culinary use in tropical gardens."
