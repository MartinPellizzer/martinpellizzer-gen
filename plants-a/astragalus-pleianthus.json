    "intro": "Astragalus pleianthus, commonly known as the broad-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It has a deep taproot system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. Astragalus pleianthus is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
