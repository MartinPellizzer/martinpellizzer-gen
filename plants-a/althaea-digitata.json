It is characterized by its hairy, cordate leaves that are often lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots contain mucilage, which has been used historically for its soothing properties. Althaea digitata typically grows in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and wet meadows."
