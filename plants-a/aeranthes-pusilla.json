    "intro": "Aeranthes pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf violet, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, fragrant blooms that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, Aeranthes pusilla is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
