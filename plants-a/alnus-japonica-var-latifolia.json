It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are often serrated along the edges. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. This species is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and its ornamental appeal."
