    "intro": "Achillea \u00d7 frivaldskyana, commonly known as the hybrid yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Achillea millefolium (common yarrow) and Achillea ptarmica (woolly yarrow), exhibiting traits from both parent species. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and flat, clustered flower heads that range in color from white to pale pink. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and open woodlands. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice in gardens for its delicate appearance and long blooming period.",
