It is characterized by its unique, hood-shaped flowers that resemble a pipe or a crown, which are typically dark green to brown in color. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and emits a mild, somewhat unpleasant odor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The genus Aristolochia is known for containing aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals."
