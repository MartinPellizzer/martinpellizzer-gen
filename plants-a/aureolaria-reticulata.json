It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and can be used in traditional herbal medicine. Aureolaria reticulata prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats."
