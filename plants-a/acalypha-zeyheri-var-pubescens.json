    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha zeyheri var. pubescens is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, growing in sandy or rocky soils. This plant thrives in open habitats like grasslands, shrublands, and along riverbanks. It is often seen in coastal areas and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its distribution is largely restricted to the region where it has evolved over time.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha zeyheri var. pubescens was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It is commonly cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and landscapes. The plant is native to southern Africa but has been introduced to other regions for its aesthetic value. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used in tropical and subtropical gardens. However, it is important to manage its growth to prevent potential invasiveness in non-native environments."
