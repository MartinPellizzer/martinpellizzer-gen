    "intro": "Appendicula polystachya, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of specialized structures called bladders, which are used for capturing small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and is found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Its flowers are small and usually pink or white, arranged in clusters along the stem. Appendicula polystachya is a carnivorous plant that relies on both photosynthesis and nutrient uptake from captured prey for survival."
