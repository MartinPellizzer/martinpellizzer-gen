    "intro": "Athyriopsis petiolata, commonly known as the slender wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 20\u201340 cm long. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the forest floor. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged along the margins of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
