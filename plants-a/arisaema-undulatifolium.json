    "intro": "Arisaema undulatifolium, commonly known as the wavy-leaved arrowhead, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, arrow-shaped leaves that have a wavy or undulating margin. The plant produces striking, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a hooded spathe, typical of the Araceae family. Its growth habit is rhizomatous, with the underground stem storing nutrients and enabling vegetative propagation. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
