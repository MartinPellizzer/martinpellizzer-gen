    "intro": "Asplenium aureum, commonly known as the golden maidenhair fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green with a golden hue on the underside. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it is valued for its ornamental beauty in horticulture. Asplenium aureum is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal."
