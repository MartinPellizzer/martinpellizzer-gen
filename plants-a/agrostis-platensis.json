    "intro": "Agrostis platensis, commonly known as the Andean grass or flatland grass, is a species of grass native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leafy blades. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet-bearing panicle, which is both ornamental and functional for seed production. Agrostis platensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat."
