    "intro": "Artemisia rupestris subsp. woodii, commonly known as western sandarac, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. It has narrow, linear leaves with a fuzzy texture and produces fluffy seed heads that are dispersed by the wind. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
