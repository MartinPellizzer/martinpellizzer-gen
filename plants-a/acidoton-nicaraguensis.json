    "intro": "Acidoton nicaraguensis, commonly known as the Nicaraguan acidoton, is a rare flowering plant native to the humid lowland forests of Nicaragua. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native habitat. It has small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss, this species is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.",
