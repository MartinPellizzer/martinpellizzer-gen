    "intro": "Austrostipa oligostachya, commonly known as the slender wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland grassland habitats. Austrostipa oligostachya plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
