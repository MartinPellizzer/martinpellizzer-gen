    "intro": "Astragalus mongholicus var. dahuricus, commonly known as the Siberian milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern China. It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in steppe and mountainous regions. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. This variety is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional Chinese medicine."
