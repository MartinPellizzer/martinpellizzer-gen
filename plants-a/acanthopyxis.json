    "intro": "Acanthopyxis, commonly known as the prickly bladder nut, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its woody shrub structure and features small, hairy leaves. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Acanthopyxis species are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
