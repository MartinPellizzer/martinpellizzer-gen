    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abildgaardia hispidula subsp. intermedia is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia. It is commonly found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. This subspecies thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often associated with disturbed or transitional habitats. It is an important component of the wetland flora in these regions. The plant is well adapted to the humid climate and seasonal flooding typical of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abildgaardia hispidula subsp. intermedia was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. It is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas where it thrives in well-drained soils. However, it is not considered invasive and has minimal impact on native ecosystems."
