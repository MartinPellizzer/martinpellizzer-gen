    "intro": "Angorkis crassa, commonly known as the thick-stemmed angorkis, is a unique plant species characterized by its robust, woody stems and large, broad leaves. It is native to the arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in dry, well-drained soils. The plant produces striking, cone-like inflorescences that are typically green or yellow in color. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Angorkis crassa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes due to its drought tolerance."
