    "intro": "Aulomyrcia jequitinhonhensis var. grandifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian wax tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are elliptical and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by yellowish-orange berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native region. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
