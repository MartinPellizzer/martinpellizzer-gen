It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of small, showy pink or purple flowers. The plant features linear, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often found in coastal areas and rock gardens due to its tolerance for salt and drought. The flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
