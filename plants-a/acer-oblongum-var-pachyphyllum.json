    "intro": "Acer oblongum var. pachyphyllum, commonly known as the thick-leaved maple, is a variant of the winged maple native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are thick and glossy, often with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental planting in gardens and landscapes.",
