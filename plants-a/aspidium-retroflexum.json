    "intro": "Aspidium retroflexum, commonly known as the broad buckler fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, rosette-like form. The plant is native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and the Indian subcontinent, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous covering. Aspidium retroflexum is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive, feathery appearance."
