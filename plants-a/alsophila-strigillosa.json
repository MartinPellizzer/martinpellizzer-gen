    "intro": "Alsophila strigillosa, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a fibrous, hairy layer that gives it its common name. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Alsophila strigillosa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks."
