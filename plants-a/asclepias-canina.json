It is characterized by its upright stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by orange or red seed pods. Asclepias canina is a member of the milkweed family, Apocynaceae, and is known for its latex sap, which is toxic to many animals. It serves as a host plant for the monarch butterfly, supporting the life cycle of this iconic insect."
