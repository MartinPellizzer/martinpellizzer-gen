    "intro": "Astragalus farctus, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Astragalus farctus is a member of the legume family and can fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility."
