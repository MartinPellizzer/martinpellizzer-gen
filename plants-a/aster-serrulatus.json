It features upright stems that are often hairy and bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with finely toothed edges. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in the fall, which attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Aster serrulatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
