    "intro": "Asplenium cuspidifolium, commonly known as the sharp-leaf spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a pointed tip, which are arranged in a rosette pattern. Its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Asplenium cuspidifolium is often found in association with other epiphytic and lithophytic plants in humid, temperate climates."
