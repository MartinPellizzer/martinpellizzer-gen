    "intro": "Aesculus indica, commonly known as the Indian horse chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically 10\u201320 cm in diameter, and its showy, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The tree produces spiny, capsule-like fruits containing one or two seeds, which are encased in a fleshy, reddish outer covering. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowers. The plant is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
