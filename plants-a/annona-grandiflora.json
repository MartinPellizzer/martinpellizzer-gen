It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, white flowers with a strong fragrance. The tree produces a fruit with a rough, green exterior and a soft, sweet, custard-like pulp. The fruit is typically harvested when it turns yellow or red, and it contains numerous small, inedible seeds. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible fruit in warm climates."
