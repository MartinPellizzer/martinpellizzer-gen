    "intro": "Amauropelta euthythrix, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually bright yellow to golden in color, which gives it its common name. The reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
