    "intro": "Athyrium deltoidofrons var. latisectum, commonly known as the broad-lobed maidenhair fern, is a variant of the deltoidofrons species within the Athyrium genus. It is characterized by its lanceolate, deeply lobed fronds that are broader than those of the typical variety. The plant produces fertile fronds with sporangia clusters, typical of the Polypodiales order. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in shaded gardens."
