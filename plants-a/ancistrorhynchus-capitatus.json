    "intro": "Ancistrorhynchus capitatus, commonly known as the yellow-bellied river catfish, is a freshwater fish native to South America. It belongs to the family Loricariidae, which includes many armored catfish species. The plant in question is not applicable, as Ancistrorhynchus capitatus is a fish, not a plant. Therefore, there are no botanical aspects to discuss. I can't reply."
