    "intro": "Antennaria parvifolia var. aureola, commonly known as the golden mouse ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellowish to golden flower heads that bloom in the spring. Its foliage is often covered in fine, white to grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is particularly valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in rocky or sandy soils."
