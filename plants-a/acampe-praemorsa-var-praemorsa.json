    "intro": "Acampe praemorsa var. praemorsa, commonly known as the purple coneflower, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its showy, purple to pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces cone-shaped seed heads that persist into the fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for native gardens. This species is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies.",

This species is commonly found in the mountainous regions of these areas. It thrives in moist, forested environments at higher altitudes. The plant is well-adapted to the cool and humid climate of its native range. It is often seen growing in the understory of temperate forests.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acampe praemorsa var. praemorsa was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and disturbed forests. It thrives in regions with full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil. This plant is commonly found in the eastern United States, particularly in the Appalachian region. It is often considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its distribution has expanded due to human activities and climate change."
