    "intro": "Aloe venenosa, commonly known as the deadly aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, covered in a layer of white powder called farina. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow-orange flowers, which bloom in late summer. Aloe venenosa is known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and is harmful if ingested. Despite its dangers, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
