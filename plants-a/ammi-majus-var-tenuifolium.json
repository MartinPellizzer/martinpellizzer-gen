    "intro": "Ammi majus var. tenuifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved cowbane, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are usually branched and covered in fine, white hairs. The leaves are lance-shaped, narrow, and have a distinct silvery-blue hue due to their dense pubescence. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbrella-like clusters called umbels, which bloom in late summer. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, and it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
