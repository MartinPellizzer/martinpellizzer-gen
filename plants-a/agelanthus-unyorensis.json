    "intro": "Agelanthus unyorensis, commonly known as the Yorensis cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the rainforests of New Guinea. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Agelanthus unyorensis is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
