    "intro": "Anthyllis macrocephala, commonly known as the large-headed anthyllis, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open grasslands. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and are often covered in fine hairs. Anthyllis macrocephala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
