    "intro": "Alopecurus aequalis subsp. aristulatus, commonly known as the hairy bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense tufts, and its leaves are narrow with a distinct hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Alopecurus aequalis subsp. aristulatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
