    "intro": "Agropyron vaseyi, commonly known as the desert wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used for soil stabilization and erosion control. Agropyron vaseyi is also valued for its role in grazing systems due to its hardiness and nutritional value."
