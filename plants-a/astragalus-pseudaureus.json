    "intro": "Astragalus pseudaureus, commonly known as the golden milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow or orange flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. It has small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus pseudaureus is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to ecological stability in arid regions."
