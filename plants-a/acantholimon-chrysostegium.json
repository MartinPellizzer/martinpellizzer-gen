    "intro": "Acantholimon chrysostegium, commonly known as the golden-stemmed acantholimon, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, blue-green foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid climates.",

    "taxonomy_art_desc": "Acantholimon chrysostegium belongs to the kingdom Plantae. Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and some green algae, characterized by their complex structures and ability to perform photosynthesis. Its class is Equisetopsida, which encompasses ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and diverse reproductive strategies. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many early-diverging angiosperms, often with primitive floral features. Its order is Caryophyllales, a group of flowering plants that includes species with distinctive flowers and often succulent or salt-tolerant adaptations. Its family is Plumbaginaceae, commonly known as the leadwort family, characterized by small flowers and often containing toxic compounds. Its genus is Acantholimon, a group of flowering plants typically found in arid or rocky habitats, with spiny or bristly leaves. Its species is Acantholimon chrysostegium, a specific plant within the genus Acantholimon, known for its unique morphological traits and ecological adaptations.",

This plant is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the eastern and central areas. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing at high altitudes. The species is adapted to the harsh climate and limited soil conditions of its native habitat. It plays a significant role in the local flora and is part of the unique biodiversity of Afghanistan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon chrysostegium was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and rocky habitats, often found in mountainous regions. It is commonly reported in the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. This plant thrives in full sun and is adapted to dry, arid environments. It has been documented in both natural and disturbed sites, including roadsides and open woodlands. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to spread and compete with native flora."
