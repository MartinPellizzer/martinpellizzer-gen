    "intro": "Alchemilla hoppeana subsp. glacialis, commonly known as glacier alkanet, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are broad, velvety, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in challenging garden conditions."
