    "intro": "Arenaria glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, fleshy leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its glandular surfaces help reduce water loss, making it resilient to extreme conditions. Arenaria glandulosa plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas."
