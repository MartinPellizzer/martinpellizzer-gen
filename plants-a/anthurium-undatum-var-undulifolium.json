    "intro": "Anthurium undatum var. undulifolium, commonly known as the wavy-leaf anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that have a wavy, undulating edge, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces vivid red spadices surrounded by a colorful spathe, which are typical features of the Araceae family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive indoors with proper care."
