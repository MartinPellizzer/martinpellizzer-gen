    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 reichsteinii, commonly known as the hybrid shield fern, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum. It is characterized by its compact, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, though it does not produce viable seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
