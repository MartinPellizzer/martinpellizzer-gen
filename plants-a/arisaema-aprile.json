It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant produces striking, often colorful spathe that can range from white to purple, depending on the variety. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. The corm-like rhizome is used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
