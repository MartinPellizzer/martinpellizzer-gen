    "intro": "Aquilegia flavescens, commonly known as the yellow columbine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spurred petals that come in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow habitats. Its leaves are deeply lobed and arranged in a basal rosette, while its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Aquilegia flavescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
