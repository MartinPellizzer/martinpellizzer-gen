    "intro": "Allium pulchellum, commonly known as the showy garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces bulbous underground structures, similar to other allium species, which store nutrients for the next growing season. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a basal rosette before flowering. Allium pulchellum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive blooms and fragrance."
