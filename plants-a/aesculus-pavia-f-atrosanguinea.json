The plant produces showy, pendulous clusters of white flowers in spring, followed by spiny, woody fruits. It is native to the southeastern United States and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its unique foliage and floral display."
