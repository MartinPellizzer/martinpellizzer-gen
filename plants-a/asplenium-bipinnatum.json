    "intro": "Asplenium bipinnatum, commonly known as the bipinnate spleenwort, is a member of the Aspleniaceae family and is characterized by its fern-like appearance. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a compact, upright growth habit with finely divided, bipinnate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of rhizomes. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Asplenium bipinnatum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
