    "intro": "Arctium pterocarpum, commonly known as the common burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces spiny, bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals or clothing. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Arctium pterocarpum thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found along roadsides and in meadows."
