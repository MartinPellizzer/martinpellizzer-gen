    "intro": "Alchemilla ramosissima, commonly known as the lesser lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, hairy leaves that form a dense, crinkled shield. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in summer, which are clustered in branched inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Alchemilla ramosissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
