    "intro": "Asclepias guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers with distinct horns. It serves as a host plant for the monarch butterfly and other milkweed-dependent species. Asclepias guatemalensis is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas."
