    "intro": "Avena cuspidata, commonly known as slender oat, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous awn-tipped florets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and have a distinct sheath at the base, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Avena cuspidata is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
