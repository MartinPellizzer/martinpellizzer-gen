    "intro": "Astrocephalus, commonly known as the star-headed cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cactaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its unique, spiny stems and showy flowers. The plants typically have a compact growth habit with a globular or cylindrical shape. They produce vibrant, often yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the evening. Astrocephalus species are adapted to arid environments and require well-draining soil and minimal water."
