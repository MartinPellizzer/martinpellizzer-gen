    "intro": "Atraphaxis afghanica, commonly known as the Afghan desert thorn, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that thrives in hot, dry environments with poor soil conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are small and often reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss. Atraphaxis afghanica is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
