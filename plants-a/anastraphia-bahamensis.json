    "intro": "Anastraphia bahamensis, commonly known as the Bahamian orchid, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the Bahamas. It is a terrestrial orchid with a unique morphology, featuring a slender, erect stem and a single, showy flower. The plant produces a delicate, pale yellow or greenish flower with a distinctive lip that is often marked with dark streaks. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in coastal dunes or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
