    "intro": "Astragalus kusnetzovii, commonly known as Kusnetzov's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces pods that contain lens-shaped seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
