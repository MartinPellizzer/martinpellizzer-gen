    "intro": "Axonopus grandifolius, commonly known as broadleaf axonopus, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, gardens, and disturbed areas. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain environments."
