    "intro": "Alnus lanata, commonly known as the woolly alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray bark and small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in catkins, which are pollinated by wind. Its fruit is a small, three-winged nutlet that is dispersed by wind. Alnus lanata is often found in moist, acidic soils and is known for its ability to thrive in wetland environments."
