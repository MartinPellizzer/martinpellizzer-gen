    "intro": "Angraecum ankeranense, commonly known as the Ankeranense orchid, is a rare and striking species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces pendulous, white or pale yellow flowers with long, slender petals and a distinctive lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or botanical gardens."
