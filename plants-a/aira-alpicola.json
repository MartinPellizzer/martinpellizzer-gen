    "intro": "Aira alpicola, commonly known as the alpine air grass, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in rocky or alpine soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
