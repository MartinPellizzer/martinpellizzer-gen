    "intro": "Angraecum aviceps, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the island of Madagascar. It features a pseudobulb with a single, narrow, lance-shaped leaf and produces a tall, branched inflorescence with numerous fragrant, white to pale blue flowers. The flowers have a distinctive spurred lip that is adapted for pollination by moths, particularly the giant hawkmoth. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. This species is noted for its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat."
