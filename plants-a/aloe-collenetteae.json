It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months, which are clustered in inflorescences. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal watering. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
