    "intro": "Angiopteris sensibilis, commonly known as the sensitive fern, is a member of the water fern family (Polypodiaceae). It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent in the dark, a trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Angiopteris sensibilis plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
