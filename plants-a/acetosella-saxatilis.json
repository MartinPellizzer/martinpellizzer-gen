    "intro": "Acetosella saxatilis, commonly known as the rock sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Acetosella saxatilis is adapted to cold climates and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience.",
