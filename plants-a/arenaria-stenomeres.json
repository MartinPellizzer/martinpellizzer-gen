    "intro": "Arenaria stenomeres, commonly known as sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its succulent leaves help it retain moisture, making it well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils. It is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
