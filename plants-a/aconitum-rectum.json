It is a perennial herb characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant has palmately divided leaves that are typically narrower than those of other aconite species. Its roots contain toxic alkaloids, making it a plant with both medicinal and dangerous properties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow environments.",
