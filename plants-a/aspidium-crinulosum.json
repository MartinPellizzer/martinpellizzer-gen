    "intro": "Aspidium crinulosum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are typically biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year. Aspidium crinulosum is often found in forests and on rocky slopes, where it contributes to the understory vegetation."
