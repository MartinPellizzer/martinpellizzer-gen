    "intro": "Agave scaposa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a rosette of sharp, blue-gray leaves that are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear small, white flowers, which appear in late spring or early summer. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Agave scaposa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and striking appearance."
