It is characterized by its upright, branched stems that bear clusters of fragrant, white to pinkish flowers. The plant has heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are finely toothed and provide a lush backdrop to its delicate blooms. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it ideal for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
