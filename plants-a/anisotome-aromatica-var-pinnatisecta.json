    "intro": "Anisotome aromatica var. pinnatisecta, commonly known as the fragrant anisotome, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features finely dissected, pinnatisected leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender, erect stems. Its aromatic foliage emits a subtle, pleasant scent, especially when crushed. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens or woodland settings."
