    "intro": "Arnica parryi subsp. genuina, commonly known as the Parry's arnica, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, rhizomatous stems and large, yellow-orange flowers with prominent yellow centers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as meadows and slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This subspecies is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in herbal remedies."
