    "intro": "Ananas viridis, commonly known as the green pineapple, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of spiky, grass-like leaves that form a central cup. The plant produces a small, edible fruit that is typically green and less sweet than the common pineapple. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil. Ananas viridis is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance."
