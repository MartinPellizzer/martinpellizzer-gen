    "intro": "Alfredia talassica, commonly known as the sea alfredia, is a rare flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale blue. The plant thrives in sandy, saline soils and is often found in intertidal zones. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in arid coastal environments. Due to habitat loss, Alfredia talassica is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
