    "intro": "Alsophila serrae, commonly known as the serrated tree fern, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the velamen. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length, contributing to its dramatic appearance. Alsophila serrae thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing cones, are located at the base of the trunk, a feature typical of many tree ferns."
