    "intro": "Acrostichum albidulum, commonly known as the white fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are usually smaller and more compact than the sterile ones. Acrostichum albidulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity.",
