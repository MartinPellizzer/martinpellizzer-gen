It is a small, terrestrial fern typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. The plant has a compact rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the leaves, typical of many ferns. Asplenium duthiei is characterized by its delicate appearance and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
