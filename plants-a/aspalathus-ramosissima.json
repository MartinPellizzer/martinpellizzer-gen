    "intro": "Aspalathus ramosissima, commonly known as rooibos, is a shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to arid conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in dry environments. Its scientific name reflects its bushy appearance, with \"ramosissima\" meaning highly branched. The plant is also notable for its caffeine-free leaves, which are used to make a popular herbal tea."
