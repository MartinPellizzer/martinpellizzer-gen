    "intro": "Asplenium pimpinellifolium, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the Mediterranean region. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium pimpinellifolium is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact size and attractive foliage."
