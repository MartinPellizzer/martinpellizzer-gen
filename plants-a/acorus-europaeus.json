    "intro": "Acorus europaeus, commonly known as European sweetflag, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features narrow, sword-shaped leaves that grow directly from the rhizomes, which are thick, fleshy underground stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green spathes that enclose the spores, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Acorus europaeus thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. Its rhizomes have been used historically in traditional medicine for their purported medicinal properties.",
