    "intro": "Allium runemarkii, commonly known as the runemark onion, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves and produces small, bulbous structures that resemble onions, though they are not edible. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Allium runemarkii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
