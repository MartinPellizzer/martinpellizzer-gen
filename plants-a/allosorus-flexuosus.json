    "intro": "Allosorus flexuosus, commonly known as the creeping wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It features small, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and silver-white underneath, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs and wetlands. Allosorus flexuosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
