    "intro": "Amblynotus, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant is native to the temperate regions of the southern hemisphere, particularly in Australia and New Zealand. Amblynotus thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, with spores produced on the underside of its fronds."
