It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are borne in clusters, followed by edible, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in primary rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
