    "intro": "Aspidium triglossum, commonly known as the three-leaf fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate (three-part) fronds that are typically arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in structures called sori. Aspidium triglossum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in a variety of conditions."
