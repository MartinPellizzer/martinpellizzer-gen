    "intro": "Athyrium biserratum, commonly known as the serrated lady fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern North America. It features delicate, bipinnate fronds that are characterized by their finely serrated margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland habitats, often along stream banks or in thickets. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread vegetatively, forming colonies over time. The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
