    "intro": "Alchemilla indivisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces upright, branched stems that bear clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often used in herbal remedies due to their astringent properties. Alchemilla indivisa is typically found in moist, shady habitats such as woodland edges and stream banks."
