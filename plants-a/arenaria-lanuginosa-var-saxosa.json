It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in crevices or on slopes. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, mountainous habitats."
