    "intro": "Astragalus stenostachys, commonly known as narrow-stalked milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus stenostachys is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
