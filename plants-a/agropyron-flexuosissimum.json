    "intro": "Agropyron flexuosissimum, commonly known as the flexible wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought. Agropyron flexuosissimum is often used for erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
