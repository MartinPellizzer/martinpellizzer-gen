    "intro": "Asplenium tricholepis, commonly known as the hairy spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it its common name. This fern typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rock crevices or on tree trunks. It has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces spore-bearing structures called sorus on the underside of its fronds. Asplenium tricholepis is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
