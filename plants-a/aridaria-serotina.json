    "intro": "Aridaria serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering aridaria, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its succulent leaves and compact growth habit, which help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom late in the growing season, typically in autumn. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers. Aridaria serotina is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand prolonged drought conditions."
