    "intro": "Aspidium angustius, commonly known as the narrow fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, linear fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, upright cluster. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. Aspidium angustius is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its ecological niche, making it a common sight in temperate regions."
