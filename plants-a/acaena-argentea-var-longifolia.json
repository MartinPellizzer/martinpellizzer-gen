    "intro": "Acaena argentea var. longifolia, commonly known as silver weed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to New Zealand. It features silver-gray leaves with a dense covering of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by spiny, berry-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena argentea var. longifolia is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the eastern and central regions. This plant typically grows in coastal areas, lowland forests, and on rocky slopes. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. Its distribution is largely restricted to the native flora of New Zealand, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena argentea var. longifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora introduced during the colonial period. This plant is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in disturbed soils. It has since become naturalized and is now considered a weed in some regions. Its introduction has had ecological impacts, altering local plant communities and competing with native species."
