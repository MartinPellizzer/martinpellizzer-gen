    "intro": "Asplenium subscalare, commonly known as the scalloped maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a scalloped or wavy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to substrates. Asplenium subscalare is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
