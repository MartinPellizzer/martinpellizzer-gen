    "intro": "Anthurium rosselianum, commonly known as the red anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces vibrant red spadices, which are the showy parts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. Anthurium rosselianum thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. It is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
