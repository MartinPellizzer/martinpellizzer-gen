    "intro": "Arabis surculosa, commonly known as the woolly rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-white, woolly leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
