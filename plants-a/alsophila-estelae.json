    "intro": "Alsophila estelae, commonly known as the Estela's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the wet tropical forests of Mexico. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-drained soil. Its spores are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat. Alsophila estelae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
