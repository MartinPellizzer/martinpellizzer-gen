    "intro": "Aristida andoniensis, commonly known as the Andoni grass, is a perennial grass species native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in grassland and savanna habitats, often found in areas with moderate rainfall. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
