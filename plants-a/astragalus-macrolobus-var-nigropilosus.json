    "intro": "Astragalus macrolobus var. nigropilosus, commonly known as the black-hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, compound leaves with stipules, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds, and it is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife, though it is not typically cultivated for agricultural purposes."
