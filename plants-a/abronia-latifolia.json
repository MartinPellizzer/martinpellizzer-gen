    "intro": "Abronia latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 centimeters. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Abronia latifolia is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats, such as coastal dunes and desert scrublands.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abronia latifolia is primarily native to British Columbia, California, Oregon, and Washington. This plant is commonly found in coastal and inland areas, often in sandy or gravelly soils. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as dunes, grasslands, and disturbed sites. The species is known for its small, showy flowers that bloom in the spring. It plays an important role in the local ecosystems of these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abronia latifolia was mainly introduced to coastal areas and sandy soils in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is commonly found in dune environments and along the shores of Oregon and Washington. This plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and full sun exposure. It is often used for erosion control due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize sand dunes. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
