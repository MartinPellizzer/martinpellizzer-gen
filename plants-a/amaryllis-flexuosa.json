    "intro": "Amaryllis flexuosa, commonly known as the zigzag amaryllis, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, recurved leaves that create a zigzag pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear clusters of striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Amaryllis flexuosa is known for its relatively low maintenance and ability to bloom reliably with proper care."
