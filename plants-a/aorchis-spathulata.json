It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant has a slender, leafless stem with a single, broad ovate leaf. Its flowers are pale green or white, with three sepals and three petals, and are arranged in a spike. Aorchis spathulata is notable for its ability to form dense colonies and is often found in association with mycorrhizal fungi."
