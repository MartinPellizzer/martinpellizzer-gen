    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon notolophium is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa. It is found in the regions of the Western Cape, Eastern Cape, and parts of the Northern Province. This plant typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils along the shoreline. It is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. Abutilon notolophium is often found in open vegetation types such as fynbos and coastal scrub.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon notolophium was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since become established in various regions. This plant is considered an environmental weed, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and riverbanks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a challenging species to control. It is now listed on several invasive plant databases in New Zealand as a potential threat to native ecosystems."
