    "intro": "Antistrophe curtisii, commonly known as the Curtis's antistrophe, is a rare and striking member of the Acanthaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its foliage consists of lance-shaped leaves with a glossy surface, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss, Antistrophe curtisii is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation efforts."
