    "intro": "Asplenium hunzanum, commonly known as the Hunza spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Pakistan and India. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has a compact rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium hunzanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light."
