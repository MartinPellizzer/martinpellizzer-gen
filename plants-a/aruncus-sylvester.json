    "intro": "Aruncus sylvester, commonly known as mountain avens, is a perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and showy, fluffy white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has heart-shaped, lobed leaves that are hairy beneath. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in woodland gardens. Aruncus sylvester is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small woodland creatures."
