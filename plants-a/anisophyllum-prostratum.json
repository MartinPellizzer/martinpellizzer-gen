    "intro": "Anisophyllum prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate anisophyllum, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes sedges and buckwheats, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves. The plant has smooth, succulent stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and it typically blooms in late spring to early summer. Anisophyllum prostratum thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments."
