    "intro": "Allium paepalanthoides, commonly known as the desert onion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by spherical, blue to purple berries. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. Allium paepalanthoides is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
