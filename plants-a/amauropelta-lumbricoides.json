    "intro": "Amauropelta lumbricoides, commonly known as the globe moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant characterized by its small, compact growth form and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its dense, cushion-like structure composed of closely packed leaves. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern around the central stem. Amauropelta lumbricoides is often found in temperate regions, particularly in forest floors and rocky crevices, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling."
