    "intro": "Allium changduense, commonly known as the Changdu onion, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its robust, cylindrical bulbs and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in umbel-like clusters during the summer months. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
