    "intro": "Asplenium denticulosum, commonly known as the toothed spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that often have a serrated or toothed edge, giving it its common name. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Asplenium denticulosum is often found in temperate regions and is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
