    "intro": "Atriplex gardneri var. robusta, commonly known as the robust saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by a variety of pollinators. Its deep root system allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it drought-tolerant. This species is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and thrive in poor, saline conditions."
