    "intro": "Agave minarum, commonly known as the Mexican fireplant, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with spines along the edges. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears yellowish-green flowers, which appear in late summer. Agave minarum is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional practices."
