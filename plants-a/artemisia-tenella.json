    "intro": "Artemisia tenella, commonly known as silver sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in compact clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Artemisia tenella is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common species in arid and semi-arid regions. It is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
