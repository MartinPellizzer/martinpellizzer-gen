    "intro": "Azaola betis, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a halophytic plant adapted to thrive in saline environments. It possesses specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which allow it to absorb oxygen from the air in waterlogged soils. The plant's leaves are alternate and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and filtering pollutants from water. Azaola betis is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in the Americas."
