    "intro": "Asplenium abbottii, commonly known as the Abbott's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows on the bark of trees or on rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a compact, clustered rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Asplenium abbottii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
