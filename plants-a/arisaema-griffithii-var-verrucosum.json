It is characterized by its distinctive, arrow-shaped leaves with a serrated edge. The plant produces an unusual, spiny structure that resembles a flower, which is actually a spadix enclosed by a spathe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions of Asia. This variant is notable for its unique morphology and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
