    "intro": "Astragalus remotijugus, commonly known as the remote jugless milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
