    "intro": "Anthemis concolor, commonly known as the narrowleaf everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in a flat-topped inflorescence, often mistaken for a single bloom. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a slightly hairy texture, and it is known for its long-lasting dried flowers used in floral arrangements. Anthemis concolor thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
