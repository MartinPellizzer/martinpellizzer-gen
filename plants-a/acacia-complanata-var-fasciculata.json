    "intro": "Acacia complanata var. fasciculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted stems and small, phyllodes that are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in spherical heads. It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in coastal landscaping.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia complanata var. fasciculata is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including parts of Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. This variety is commonly found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, where it thrives in dry, well-drained conditions. It is often associated with shrublands and grasslands, forming part of the local vegetation in these ecosystems. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climate of its native range, showing resilience to drought and high temperatures. Its distribution is limited to specific areas where it can establish and persist over time.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia complanata var. fasciculata was mainly introduced to regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by mild, wet winters and dry summers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils. This plant is often used in landscaping due to its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate drought conditions. It has been introduced to parts of California and other areas with similar climatic conditions. However, its spread can sometimes lead to ecological concerns in non-native environments."
