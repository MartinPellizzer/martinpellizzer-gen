    "intro": "Andropogon nardoides, commonly known as sweetgrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its fine, feathery leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wet meadows. Its leaves emit a subtle, sweet aroma when crushed, which has made it culturally significant to various Indigenous communities. Botanically, it belongs to the Poaceae family and is closely related to other grasses like switchgrass and bluestem."
