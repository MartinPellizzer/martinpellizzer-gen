    "intro": "Astragalus hololeios, commonly known as the golden milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces pods that contain lens-shaped seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. Astragalus hololeios thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
