    "intro": "Aconitum brachypodum var. crispulum, commonly known as the crested aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has palmate leaves with a distinctive wavy or crinkled edge, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its toxic nature, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets.",
