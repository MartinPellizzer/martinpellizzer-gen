    "intro": "Adenoderris viscidula, commonly known as the sticky adenoderris, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Its sticky leaves and stems are adapted to retain moisture in arid environments, making it well-suited for dry habitats. Adenoderris viscidula is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation.",
