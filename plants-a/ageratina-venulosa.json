    "intro": "Ageratina venulosa, commonly known as the white crownbeard, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in dense clusters, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Ageratina venulosa is often found in moist, shaded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
