    "intro": "Anemonoides minima, commonly known as the dwarf anemone, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often with a central yellowish or greenish hue. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific growing conditions to flourish."
