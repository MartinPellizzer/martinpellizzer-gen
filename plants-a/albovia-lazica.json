    "intro": "Albovia lazica, commonly known as the Lazica lily, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
