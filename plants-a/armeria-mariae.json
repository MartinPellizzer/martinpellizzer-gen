    "intro": "Armeria mariae, commonly known as sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its dense clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its salt tolerance and hardiness. Armeria mariae is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in maritime environments."
