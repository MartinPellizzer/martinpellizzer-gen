    "intro": "Astragalus tragacantha subsp. salvatoris, commonly known as the Persian milkvetch, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments, making it a resilient species in semi-desert ecosystems. It produces a sticky, resinous substance called tragacanth, which has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a thickening agent. This subspecies is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
