    "intro": "Adesmia subnuda, commonly known as the naked-stemmed burr vine, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Leguminosae family, characterized by its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, followed by pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Its stems are often hairy, and the leaves are pinnately compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets. Adesmia subnuda is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks.",
