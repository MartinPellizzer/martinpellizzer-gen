    "intro": "Achyropsis gracilis, commonly known as the slender glasswort, is a halophytic plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing, succulent perennial that thrives in saline and alkaline soils. The plant features thin, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically greenish-white and appear in clusters. Achyropsis gracilis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates.",
