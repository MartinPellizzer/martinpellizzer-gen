    "intro": "Ancistrochilus, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia. They are typically epiphytic or lithophytic, growing on trees or rocks, and are characterized by their compact, often brightly colored flowers. The leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette, adapted to store water in arid environments. Ancistrochilus species are prized for their ornamental value and are often cultivated in greenhouses or terrariums."
