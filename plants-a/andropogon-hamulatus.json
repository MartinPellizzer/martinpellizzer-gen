    "intro": "Andropogon hamulatus, commonly known as flat-stemmed grass or eastern woodland grass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and is characterized by its flat, ribbed stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it a common component of wetland and forest understory vegetation. Andropogon hamulatus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various insects and small animals."
