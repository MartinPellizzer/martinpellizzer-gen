    "intro": "Agraphis, commonly known as the \"false dandelion,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and small, yellowish composite flowers that resemble dandelions. Agraphis species are often found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in rocky or sandy soils. They produce seeds in the form of tiny, wind-dispersed pappus structures, aiding in their spread. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine or as ornamental plants."
