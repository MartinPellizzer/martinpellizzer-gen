It belongs to the family Solanaceae, which includes nightshades, and is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, tubular flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically red or yellow when mature, and it is adapted to survive in dry, nutrient-poor soils. Anisodus caulescens is also known for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses involving its alkaloid-rich leaves."
