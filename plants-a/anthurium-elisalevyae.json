It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces vibrant, spadix-shaped inflorescences surrounded by colorful, waxy spatula-like bracts. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air humidity and well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
