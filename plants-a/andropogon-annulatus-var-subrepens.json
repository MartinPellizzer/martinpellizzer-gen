    "intro": "Andropogon annulatus var. subrepens, commonly known as the creeping bluestem, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue, and its inflorescence consists of dense, cylindrical spikelets. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along waterways. Its creeping growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species."
