    "intro": "Andropogon malacostachyus, commonly known as purple false panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed soils. It is adapted to full sun and well-drained soil conditions, making it a common sight in prairie and savanna ecosystems. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its striking floral display and drought tolerance."
