It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and aromatic, narrow leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. Artemisia costae thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and rocky habitats. Its essential oils contain compounds like thujone and camphor, which contribute to its distinctive fragrance and medicinal uses."
