    "intro": "Athyrium fimbriatum var. foliolosum, commonly known as the lace fern, is a strikingly ornamental fern native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance, with each leaflet being narrow and sharply pointed. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clumps over time. It is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in partial to full shade."
