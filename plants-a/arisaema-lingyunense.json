    "intro": "Arisaema lingyunense, commonly known as the Lingyun arrowhead, is a species of flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the Araceae family, which is characterized by its unique inflorescence structure known as a spadix, enclosed by a spathe. The plant produces a tall, slender stem topped with a single, showy spathe that resembles an arrowhead, hence its common name. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow and are arranged in a dense, clustered spadix. Arisaema lingyunense is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks."
