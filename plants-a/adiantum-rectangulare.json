    "intro": "Adiantum rectangulare, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a feathery appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and thrives in well-drained, humus-rich soil. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Adiantum rectangulare is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its elegant foliage and ease of care.",
