    "intro": "Acer cappadocicum var. sinicum, commonly known as the Chinese maple, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its palmate leaves that are typically 5-9 lobes, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.",

This variety is found in mountainous areas at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is commonly found in forests and rocky slopes. The plant is part of the maple family and is known for its ornamental value. It is also occasionally cultivated in other parts of Asia for its aesthetic appeal and ecological benefits.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer cappadocicum var. sinicum was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates that provide suitable growing conditions for its unique foliage and ornamental value. It is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its vibrant autumn colors and distinctive leaf shapes. This variety is particularly valued for its adaptability to well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Its introduction has expanded the range of maple species available for horticultural use in various parts of the world. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native environments."
