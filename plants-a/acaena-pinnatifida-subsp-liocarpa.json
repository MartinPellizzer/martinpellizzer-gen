    "intro": "Acaena pinnatifida subsp. liocarpa, commonly known as the New Zealand thistle, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a member of the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, bristly stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces distinctive achene fruits, which are surrounded by a persistent, woolly pappus that aids in seed dispersal. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and forest margins, and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens.",

This subspecies thrives in coastal and lowland environments. It is commonly associated with sandy soils and open habitats. The plant is part of the native flora of the New Zealand archipelago.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena pinnatifida subsp. liocarpa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century. The plant was initially planted for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and flowers. However, it has since become naturalized and is now considered a weed in some areas. Its spread has raised concerns due to its potential impact on native ecosystems."
