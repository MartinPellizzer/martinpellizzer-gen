    "intro": "Aulomyrcia spruceana, commonly known as the Spruce's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Viscaceae family. It grows on the branches of coniferous trees, primarily spruces, and derives some of its nutrients from its host. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves are scale-like and remain throughout the year, contributing to its evergreen appearance. Aulomyrcia spruceana plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing food for certain birds and insects."
