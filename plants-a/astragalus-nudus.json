    "intro": "Astragalus nudus, commonly known as the naked milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to reddish-purple flowers in late spring. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Astragalus nudus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
