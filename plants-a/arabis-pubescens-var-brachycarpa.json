    "intro": "Arabis pubescens var. brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-fruited rockcress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features basal rosettes of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine pubescence. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and arranged in racemes, blooming in early spring. The fruit is a short, capsule that contains several seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its alpine habitat."
