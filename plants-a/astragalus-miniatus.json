    "intro": "Astragalus miniatus, commonly known as the dwarf milkvetch, is a small perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and open grasslands. The plant features slender, erect stems with small, pinnately compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Astragalus miniatus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
