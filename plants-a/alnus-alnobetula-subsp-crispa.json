    "intro": "Alnus alnobetula subsp. crispa, commonly known as the wrinkled alder, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely serrated leaves that give it a unique, textured appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are typical of the alder genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks. Its ecological importance includes nitrogen fixation, which enriches the soil and supports other plant life."
