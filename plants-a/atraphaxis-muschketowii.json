    "intro": "Atraphaxis muschketowii, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and gray-green foliage that is adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, globular inflorescences. Its leaves are small, narrow, and covered in a fine, whitish pubescence that helps reduce water loss. Atraphaxis muschketowii is well-suited to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping in desert environments."
