    "intro": "Aster foliaceus var. arcuans, commonly known as the curlyleaf aster, is a compact, low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often curled or twisted, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white to pale blue, typically blooming in late summer to early fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for wetland gardens. Its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
