    "intro": "Asclepias selloana, commonly known as the Sello's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces a milky sap, which is typical of the milkweed genus. Its leaves are opposite and often have a waxy texture, while its stems are hairy and can be somewhat brittle. Asclepias selloana serves as a host plant for the monarch butterfly and other milkweed-dependent species."
