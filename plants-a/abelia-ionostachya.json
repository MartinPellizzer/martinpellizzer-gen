    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelia ionostachya is primarily native to China Southeast and Japan. This plant is commonly found in the mountainous regions of these areas. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Abelia ionostachya is often associated with forest edges and rocky slopes. Its natural habitat reflects its adaptation to the diverse environments of East Asia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia ionostachya was mainly introduced to the eastern United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive pink flowers and compact growth habit. It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas, particularly in regions with mild winters and well-drained soil. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in shrub borders or as a hedge. Despite its ornamental value, it has shown some invasive tendencies in certain areas, leading to concerns about its ecological impact. Proper management is recommended to prevent its spread into natural habitats."
