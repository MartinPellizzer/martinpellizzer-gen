    "intro": "Acacia dumosa, commonly known as the straggly wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, twisted branches and small, yellow flower spikes that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant has phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that perform the function of true leaves. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Acacia dumosa is drought-tolerant and is used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia dumosa is primarily native to Australia, particularly in the arid and semi-arid regions of the central and western parts of the country. It is commonly found in areas such as the Great Sandy Desert, the Simpson Desert, and the Northern Territory. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to the harsh, dry conditions of its native habitat. It is an important component of the local flora and provides food and shelter for various wildlife species. Acacia dumosa is also known as the \"mulga\" and plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its environment.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia dumosa was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly used in land rehabilitation projects due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant has also been introduced for ornamental purposes because of its distinctive yellow flowers and thorny structure. It is found in various parts of Australia and has been introduced to other regions with similar climates. However, in some areas, it has become invasive, posing a threat to native vegetation."
