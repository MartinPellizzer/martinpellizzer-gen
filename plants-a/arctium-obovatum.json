    "intro": "Arctium obovatum, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed. The plant produces spiny, brown bur-like fruits that contain seeds, which are adapted for wind dispersal. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense, purple to pinkish inflorescences. Arctium obovatum is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows."
