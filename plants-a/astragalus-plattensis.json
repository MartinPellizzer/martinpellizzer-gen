    "intro": "Astragalus plattensis, commonly known as plains milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and sandy soils. Astragalus plattensis plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in restoration projects."
