    "intro": "Asparagus denudatus subsp. nudicaulis, commonly known as the naked-stem asparagus, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems that often appear bare, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers in clusters, which are followed by spiny, three-lobed berries. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. This subspecies is often found in rocky or coastal habitats, where it adapts to arid and nutrient-poor conditions."
