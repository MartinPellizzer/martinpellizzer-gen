    "intro": "Axonopus purpusii var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous axonopus, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth and hairless. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the grass family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, gardens, and disturbed areas. Its low-growing habit and dense foliage make it a useful ground cover in ornamental landscaping."
