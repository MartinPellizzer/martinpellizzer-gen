    "intro": "Artemisia ambigua, commonly known as gray gooseweed, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, and its aromatic leaves contain volatile oils that contribute to its distinctive scent. Artemisia ambigua is often found in moist, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small mammals."
