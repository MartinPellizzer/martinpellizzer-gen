    "intro": "Acacia linarioides, commonly known as the narrowleaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces small yellow flowers arranged in cylindrical spikes, which bloom in spring. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for dryland gardens. Acacia linarioides also has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia linarioides is primarily native to the Northern Territory. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within this area. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Its distribution is largely restricted to the northern parts of Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia linarioides was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island, where it spreads along roadsides and in disturbed areas. The plant is considered invasive in some parts of its range, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems. Its rapid growth and seed dispersal mechanisms contribute to its spread and persistence in the environment. Management efforts focus on controlling its spread to protect biodiversity and ecological balance."
