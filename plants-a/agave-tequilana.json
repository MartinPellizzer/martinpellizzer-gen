    "intro": "Agave tequilana, commonly known as the blue agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are blue-green in color and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that can reach several meters in height, bearing white flowers. Its core, called the pi\u00f1a, is the primary source of agave sap used in tequila production. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments."
