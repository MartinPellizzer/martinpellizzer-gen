    "intro": "Alchemilla polemochora, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, silver-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Alchemilla polemochora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in alpine settings."
