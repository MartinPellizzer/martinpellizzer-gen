    "intro": "Androsace arguta, commonly known as the alpine mouse ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its dense, rosette-like foliage composed of small, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Androsace arguta thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
