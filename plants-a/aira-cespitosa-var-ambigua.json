    "intro": "Aira cespitosa var. ambigua, commonly known as the ambiguous bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils and full sun to partial shade. This variant is often found in open woodlands, prairies, and along roadsides, contributing to its ecological versatility."
