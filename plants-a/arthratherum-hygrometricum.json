It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is often found in moist, calcareous soils, typically in meadows and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Arthratherum hygrometricum is known for its ability to thrive in humid environments, making it a common sight in wetland ecosystems."
