    "intro": "Arethusa plicata, commonly known as the common marsh orchid, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of small, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive hooded lip. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Arethusa plicata plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
