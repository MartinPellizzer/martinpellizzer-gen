    "intro": "Aspidium copelandii, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that are typically broad and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help in anchoring the plant to substrates like soil or rock. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori."
