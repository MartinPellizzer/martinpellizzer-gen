    "intro": "Angiopteris laciniata, commonly known as the lace fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is native to Southeast Asia, including regions such as India, China, and Indonesia. The plant exhibits a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that produce both sterile and fertile fronds. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a feathery appearance that gives it a distinctive, ornamental look. Angiopteris laciniata is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
