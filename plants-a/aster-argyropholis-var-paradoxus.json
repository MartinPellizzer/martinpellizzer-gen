    "intro": "Aster argyropholis var. paradoxus, commonly known as the silverleaf aster, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to full sun. Its botanical structure includes a basal rosette of leaves and a flowering stem that can reach up to 30 inches in height."
