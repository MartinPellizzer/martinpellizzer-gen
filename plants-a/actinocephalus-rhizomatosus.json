    "intro": "Actinocephalus rhizomatosus, commonly known as the zigzag plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. The plant has slender, creeping stems that often exhibit a zigzag growth pattern, giving it its common name. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom in spring. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance.",
