    "intro": "Artanthe oblonga, commonly known as the narrowleaf artanthe, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features basal leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped, with a bluish-green hue. Its small, showy flowers are usually pink or purple, arranged in dense, clustered inflorescences. Artanthe oblonga is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and visual interest."
