    "intro": "Adambea, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to Africa. These plants are characterized by their compact rosettes of velvety, waxy leaves and clusters of showy, tubular flowers. The leaves are typically thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. Adambea species often have a short stem and produce flowers in a wide range of colors, including purple, pink, white, and blue. They are popular houseplants due to their attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
