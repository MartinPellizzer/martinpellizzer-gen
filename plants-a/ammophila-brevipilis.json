    "intro": "Ammophila brevipilis, commonly known as the short-haired marram grass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can stabilize dunes through its extensive root system. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with short, fine hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring, which are wind-pollinated. Ammophila brevipilis plays a crucial role in preventing coastal erosion and maintaining dune ecosystems."
