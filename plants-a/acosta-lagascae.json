    "intro": "Acosta lagascae, commonly known as the Andean sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to the cold, dry conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Acosta lagascae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates.",
