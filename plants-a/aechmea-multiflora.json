    "intro": "Aechmea multiflora, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It features a rosette of long, narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by colorful bracts, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from intense sunlight. Aechmea multiflora is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
