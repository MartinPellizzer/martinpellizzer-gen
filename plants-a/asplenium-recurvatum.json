    "intro": "Asplenium recurvatum, commonly known as the curl-leaf spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, intricately veined fronds that often curl at the tips. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly through underground stems. Its leaves are usually less than 10 centimeters in length and have a distinctive, fern-like appearance. Asplenium recurvatum is often found on rocks or in crevices, thriving in humid, temperate climates."
