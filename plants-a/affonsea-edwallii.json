    "intro": "Affonsea edwallii, commonly known as the Edwall's affonsea, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth, glossy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Affonsea edwallii is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
