    "intro": "Asplenium denticulatum, commonly known as the toothed spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its small, dark green, strap-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, tooth-like structures along the margins. This fern typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium denticulatum is a hardy plant that thrives in humid climates and is often found in temperate regions."
