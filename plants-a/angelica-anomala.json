    "intro": "Angelica anomala, commonly known as the common angelica, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, and its large, compound leaves with a pungent, aromatic scent. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in an umbel, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Angelica anomala thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
