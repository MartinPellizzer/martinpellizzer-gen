    "intro": "Artemisia depressa, commonly known as dwarf mugwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It typically forms dense mats of silver-gray foliage with narrow, aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or rocky areas. Artemisia depressa is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
