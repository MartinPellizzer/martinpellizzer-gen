    "intro": "Armeria maritima f. originaria, commonly known as the Mexican sea thrift, is a compact, low-growing evergreen perennial native to coastal regions of Mexico. It features dense clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate ornamental touch to gardens. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are gray-green in color, providing a striking contrast to its floral display. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking a resilient, drought-tolerant plant."
