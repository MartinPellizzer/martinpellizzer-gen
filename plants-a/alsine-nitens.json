    "intro": "Alsine nitens, commonly known as the slender sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Alsine nitens thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in disturbed areas and provides nectar for pollinators."
