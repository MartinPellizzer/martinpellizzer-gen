    "intro": "Andropogon micranthus var. violascens, commonly known as purple muhly, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, violet to purple-colored inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and prairies, and is adapted to moist, well-drained soils. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more pronounced during the growing season. Purple muhly is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
