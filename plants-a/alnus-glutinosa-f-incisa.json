    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa f. incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alder, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins that hang in clusters, typical of the Betulaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources such as streams and wetlands. The bark is typically smooth and grey, becoming fissured with age, and the plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in soil enrichment."
