    "intro": "Amicia lobbiana, commonly known as the mountain amicia, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of eastern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
