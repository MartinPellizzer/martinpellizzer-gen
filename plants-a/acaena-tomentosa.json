    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena tomentosa is primarily native to South America, particularly in regions of Chile and Argentina. It is commonly found in temperate climates, growing in open areas such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with coastal and mountainous environments. It is an important component of the local flora in these regions. Acaena tomentosa is also known for its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena tomentosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century. The plant was initially grown as an ornamental species due to its attractive foliage and flowers. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns as it outcompetes native plants for resources."
