    "intro": "Annona palustris, commonly known as swamp custardapple, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rough, spiny stems and heart-shaped, hairy leaves. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by large, greenish-white fruits. The fruit has a smooth, waxy skin and a creamy, custard-like pulp that is edible. It is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
