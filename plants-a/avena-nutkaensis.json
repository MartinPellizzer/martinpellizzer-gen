    "intro": "Avena nutkaensis, commonly known as Nutka wild oat, is a perennial grass native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically grows in moist, coastal environments and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which develop into awned grains. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Avena nutkaensis is often found in maritime climates and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds."
