    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abuta froesii is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments within the undergrowth of dense forests. It is commonly found in the Amazon Basin and other regions with high biodiversity. Abuta froesii is well adapted to the warm and moist conditions of its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abuta froesii was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun exposure. It is commonly found in regions with a temperate climate, particularly in the northeastern United States. This plant thrives in environments where there is adequate rainfall and moderate temperatures. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators. However, it requires careful management to prevent it from spreading beyond controlled areas."
