    "intro": "Androsace mathildae, commonly known as the Mathilde's alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Androsace mathildae is also valued for its ability to tolerate cold climates and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
