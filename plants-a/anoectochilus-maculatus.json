    "intro": "Anoectochilus maculatus, commonly known as the spotted orchid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, velvety leaves with distinct white or pale markings. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose substrates. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural habitat, it is often cultivated in conservation programs."
