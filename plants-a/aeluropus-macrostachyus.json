    "intro": "Aeluropus macrostachyus, commonly known as the desert grass or coastal grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and coastal regions of the Mediterranean and Middle East. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous roots that help stabilize sandy soils. The plant produces spikelets that are typically 2\u20135 cm long, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in saline and drought-prone environments, making it an important species for coastal dune stabilization. Its ability to tolerate extreme conditions makes it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
