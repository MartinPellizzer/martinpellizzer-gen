    "intro": "Amaryllis iguapensis, commonly known as the Iguap\u00e9s amaryllis, is a striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family, which includes many bulbous plants known for their showy flowers. The plant features a large, fleshy bulb that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its humid, shaded environment. Its flowers are typically large, trumpet-shaped, and come in shades of white, pink, and red, often with a strong, spicy fragrance. Amaryllis iguapensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
