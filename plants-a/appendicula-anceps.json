    "intro": "Appendicula anceps, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, grass-like leaves and small, white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a rosette, which helps reduce water loss. Appendicula anceps is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
