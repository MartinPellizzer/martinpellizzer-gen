    "intro": "Aveledoa nucifera, commonly known as the coconut palm, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces coconuts, which are encased in a fibrous husk and contain both water and milk. The coconut fruit develops from the flowers of the plant and is a key feature of its botanical structure. It plays an important role in both ecological and economic systems in tropical regions."
