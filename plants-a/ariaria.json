It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flower heads. The plant has narrow, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping it retain moisture in saline environments. Ariaria thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found growing along shorelines and dunes. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for coastal gardens and landscaping."
