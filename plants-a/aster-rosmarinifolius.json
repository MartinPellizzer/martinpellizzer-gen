    "intro": "Aster rosmarinifolius, commonly known as rugosa or sweet everlasting, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and gray-green, aromatic leaves that resemble rosemary. The plant produces dense clusters of small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom from late summer to early autumn. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its long-lasting flowers are often used in floral arrangements due to their ability to retain color and form for extended periods."
