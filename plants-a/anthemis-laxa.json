    "intro": "Anthemis laxa, commonly known as the slender ragwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. Its yellow flowers, which bloom from spring to early summer, are arranged in clusters and are often visited by pollinators like bees and butterflies. The leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
