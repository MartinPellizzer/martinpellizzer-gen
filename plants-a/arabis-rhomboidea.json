    "intro": "Arabis rhomboidea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many familiar garden plants such as cabbages and mustards. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine environments. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat."
