    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum var. hirsutus, commonly known as hairy sorghum, is a perennial grass native to the warm temperate and tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, robust stalks and dense, hairy foliage that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 5 meters, with leaves that are broad and serrated at the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of spikelets, which produce small, two-lobed flowers. Hairy sorghum is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny environments."
