    "intro": "Asplenium majoricum, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are robust, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. The fronds are divided into shield-shaped segments, giving the plant its common name and contributing to its distinctive appearance."
