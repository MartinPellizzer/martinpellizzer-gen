    "intro": "Asclepias angustata, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release seeds attached to silky parachutes, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in open woods, prairies, and along roadsides. Asclepias angustata is an important host plant for monarch butterflies, supporting their life cycle."
