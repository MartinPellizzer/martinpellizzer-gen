    "intro": "Agnanthus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Plumbagaceae. It is characterized by its striking, often blue or purple, bract-like flowers that resemble small, delicate holly leaves. The plants typically grow in coastal areas and are adapted to salty, well-drained soils. Agnanthus species are perennial shrubs with woody stems and showy inflorescences that bloom in late summer or early autumn. These plants are valued in gardens for their ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
