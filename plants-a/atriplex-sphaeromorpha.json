    "intro": "Atriplex sphaeromorpha, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it well adapted to saline soils. Atriplex sphaeromorpha plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for wildlife."
