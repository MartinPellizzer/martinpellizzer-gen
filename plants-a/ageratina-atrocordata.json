    "intro": "Ageratina atrocordata, commonly known as whiteflower false fleabane, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its fluffy, white to pale blue flower heads that resemble dandelions, which are actually composed of many tiny florets. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are usually opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Ageratina atrocordata is often used in ornamental gardening due to its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators."
