    "intro": "Afrosciadium trisectum, commonly known as the three-lobed African scurvygrass, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is native to southern Africa and thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in woodland or grassland habitats. The plant features finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Its small white or greenish flowers appear in clusters, and the plant is known for its peppery taste, similar to that of wild mustard. Afrosciadium trisectum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local insect populations."
