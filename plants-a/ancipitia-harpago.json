    "intro": "Ancipitia harpago, commonly known as the harpoon vine, is a climbing plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking flowers with five petals, often in shades of pink or purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its unique feature is the presence of hooked structures on its stems, which aid in climbing and securing itself to supports. Ancipitia harpago is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses."
