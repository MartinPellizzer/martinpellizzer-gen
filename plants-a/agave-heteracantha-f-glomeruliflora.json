    "intro": "Agave heteracantha f. glomeruliflora, commonly known as the clustered-flowered agave, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears numerous small, clustered inflorescences. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow and attract pollinators such as bees and moths. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in dry climates."
