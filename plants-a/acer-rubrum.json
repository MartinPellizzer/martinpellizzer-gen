    "intro": "Acer rubrum, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red in the fall. The tree produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. Its roots are fibrous and can tolerate a variety of soil conditions, making it adaptable to different environments. The red maple is also valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in supporting wildlife.",
