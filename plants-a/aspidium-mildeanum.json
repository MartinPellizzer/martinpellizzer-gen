    "intro": "Aspidium mildeanum, commonly known as the Milde's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically borne on long, creeping rhizomes. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines along the margins of the fronds. Aspidium mildeanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
