    "intro": "Asclepias cryptoceras, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Asclepias cryptoceras is a host plant for the monarch butterfly and other milkweed-dependent species. Its milkweed sap contains toxic compounds that deter herbivores."
