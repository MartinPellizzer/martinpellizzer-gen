    "intro": "Artemisia pudica, commonly known as the humble wormwood, is a flowering plant native to various parts of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of about 30 centimeters, with slender, branched stems and small, aromatic leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in small spherical heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. Artemisia pudica is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are used traditionally in some cultures for their medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antiseptic effects."
