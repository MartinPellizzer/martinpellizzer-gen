    "intro": "Aspidium bourgaei, commonly known as the African shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and colonize new areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Aspidium bourgaei is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
