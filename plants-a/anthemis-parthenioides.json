    "intro": "Anthemis parthenioides, commonly known as the golden groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and grasslands. It produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. The leaves are usually gray-green with a fuzzy texture, and the plant is often used in herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
