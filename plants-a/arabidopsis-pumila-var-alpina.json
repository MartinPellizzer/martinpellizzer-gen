    "intro": "Arabidopsis pumila var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear cress, is a small, mat-forming plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops. This species is characterized by its compact rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and small white flowers. It thrives in cold, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Due to its short life cycle and genetic simplicity, it is often used in plant research, though it is less commonly studied than the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana."
