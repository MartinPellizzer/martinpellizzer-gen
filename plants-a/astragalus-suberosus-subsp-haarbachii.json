    "intro": "Astragalus suberosus subsp. haarbachii, commonly known as the Harbach's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its hairy, often glandular stems and leaves that are typically trifoliate or pinnately compound. The plant produces small, yellow to greenish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf and flower structure."
