    "intro": "Aspidium kilemense, commonly known as the Kilemene shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick layer of brownish or reddish mycorrhizal sheath, which helps in nutrient absorption. Aspidium kilemense is valued for its ornamental foliage and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
