    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha illustris is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with forest understories or near water bodies. It is also present in parts of India and the Philippines. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions outside its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha illustris was mainly introduced to urban and disturbed areas due to its adaptability and ornamental value. It thrives in environments with moderate to high light and well-drained soil. This plant is often found along roadsides, in vacant lots, and in residential areas where it can spread rapidly. Its introduction has led to concerns about its invasive potential in some regions. Proper management is recommended to prevent its spread into natural habitats."
