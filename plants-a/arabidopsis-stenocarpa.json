    "intro": "Arabidopsis stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited thale cress, is a small flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known species like Arabidopsis thaliana. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that remains closed until maturity, releasing seeds through a mechanism called dehiscence. This species is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in local ecosystems."
