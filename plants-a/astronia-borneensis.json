    "intro": "Astronia borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean astronia, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Astronia borneensis is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
