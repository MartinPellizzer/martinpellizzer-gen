    "intro": "Andropogon nardus var. validus, commonly known as sweetgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America, particularly found in wetland and marshy areas. It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and its distinctive, sweet-smelling aroma when crushed. The plant typically grows in dense clumps and has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish in moist environments. Its flowering stems are slender and bear small, spike-like inflorescences. Sweetgrass is often used in traditional crafts and ceremonies due to its aromatic properties and cultural significance."
