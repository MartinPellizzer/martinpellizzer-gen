It thrives in areas with limited rainfall and well-drained soils. The species is commonly associated with mountainous and semi-desert landscapes. Its native distribution is limited to specific ecological niches in these two countries.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon gulistanum was mainly introduced to areas with rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous or semi-arid regions. It thrives in well-drained environments and is commonly found in alpine or subalpine zones. This plant is typically associated with disturbed or open habitats, such as roadsides, quarries, and cultivated fields. Its introduction has been documented in several regions outside its native range, including parts of Europe and North America. Due to its hardy nature, it can establish itself quickly in new environments, sometimes becoming invasive in local ecosystems."
