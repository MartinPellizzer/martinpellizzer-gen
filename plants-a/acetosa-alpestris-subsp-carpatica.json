It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. It is valued for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. This subspecies is also noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.",
