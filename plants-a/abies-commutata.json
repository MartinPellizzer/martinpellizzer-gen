    "intro": "Abies commutata, commonly known as the white fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and its dense, soft needles that are typically light green with a silvery-white underside. The tree produces small, spherical cones that hang from the branches, containing winged seeds. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age. Abies commutata thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies commutata is primarily native to the northern United States and southern Canada. It is found in regions such as Alaska, the Yukon, and parts of the northern Rockies. This species thrives in high-altitude environments and is commonly associated with subalpine and alpine forests. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas with cold climates. The plant's distribution is limited to specific ecological zones where it can tolerate the harsh environmental conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies commutata was mainly introduced to specific regions in North America, particularly in the western United States. It has been planted in areas where its cold-hardy nature and ornamental value make it desirable for landscaping and reforestation efforts. However, its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in certain ecosystems. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Despite its aesthetic appeal, its spread can have ecological impacts on local flora and fauna."
