    "intro": "Ajuga \u00d7 perbracteata, commonly known as carpet bugle or silver carpet, is a low-growing perennial groundcover plant native to eastern North America. It features dense, mat-forming growth with slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and is well-suited for rock gardens, woodland settings, and as a groundcover in shaded areas. Its foliage remains attractive throughout the growing season, making it a valuable ornamental plant in moist, well-drained soils."
