    "intro": "Achroanthes, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its unique, often pale or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plants are typically small shrubs or herbs, with simple, alternate leaves that are usually hairy. Achroanthes species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Africa and the Americas. They are known for their unusual floral structures and are of interest in botanical studies due to their ecological adaptations."
