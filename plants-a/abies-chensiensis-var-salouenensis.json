    "intro": "Abies chensiensis var. salouenensis, commonly known as the Salouenensis fir, is a rare variant of the Chinese fir. It is native to the mountainous regions of eastern China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. This evergreen conifer is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The cones are typically small and clustered, with reddish-brown scales. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forest ecosystems.",

This variant of the species is found in mountainous regions characterized by high altitudes and cool, moist climates. It typically grows in forests at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,000 meters. The plant is adapted to the rugged terrain and specific ecological conditions of these areas. Its distribution reflects its preference for temperate coniferous forests in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies chensiensis var. salouenensis was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically in higher elevation regions. It thrives in temperate zones with adequate rainfall and partial shade. This variety is often found in mountainous areas of China, where it has adapted to specific environmental conditions. Its introduction has been primarily for ornamental purposes and reforestation efforts. However, it is not commonly cultivated outside its native range due to its specific habitat requirements."
