    "intro": "Angraecopsis, commonly known as the star orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the Orchidaceae family. These plants are native to the arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in Namibia and South Africa. Angraecopsis species are characterized by their striking, star-shaped flowers that are often fragrant and attract nocturnal pollinators like moths. They typically grow as small, compact shrubs with narrow, grass-like leaves. The genus is noted for its diverse range of flower colors, including white, yellow, and purple, which contribute to its ornamental value."
