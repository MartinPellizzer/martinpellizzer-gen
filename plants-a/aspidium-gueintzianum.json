    "intro": "Aspidium gueintzianum, commonly known as the Gueintzian water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically bioluminescent in certain environmental conditions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered on the undersides of its leaves. Aspidium gueintzianum plays a role in maintaining soil moisture and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
