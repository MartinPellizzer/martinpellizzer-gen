    "intro": "Aspidium conionevron, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, lobed fronds that are often used in traditional medicine and horticulture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous roots that help anchor it to rocky or wet soil. The spores are released from the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
