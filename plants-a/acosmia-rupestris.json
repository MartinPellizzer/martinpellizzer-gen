    "intro": "Acosmia rupestris, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and rocky habitats in southern Africa. It features a compact, upright growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the stems. Its root system is adapted to thrive in poor, well-drained soils, and it is drought-tolerant once established. Acosmia rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens.",
