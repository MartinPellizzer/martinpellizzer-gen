    "intro": "Alchemilla alata, commonly known as silverweed, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit. The plant features basal leaves that are toothed and covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it its common name. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Alchemilla alata is often found in moist, calcareous soils and is used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported healing properties."
