    "intro": "Atraphaxis glareosa, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy and rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Atraphaxis glareosa is well adapted to harsh desert environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
