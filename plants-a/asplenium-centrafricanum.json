    "intro": "Asplenium centrafricanum, commonly known as the Central African spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and dark green, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called soridia, are borne on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium centrafricanum is primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of Central Africa."
