    "intro": "Aster reptans, commonly known as the creeping aster, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and arranged alternately along the stems. Aster reptans is often found in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
