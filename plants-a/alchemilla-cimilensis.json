    "intro": "Alchemilla cimilensis, commonly known as the Cimil Valley lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of silky white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are clustered in narrow, upright inflorescences. Alchemilla cimilensis is adapted to cold, rocky environments and is often found in alpine meadows."
