It features small, yellow flowers with four petals and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are typically lobed or divided. It is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate poor soil conditions. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a pioneer species in alpine ecosystems."
