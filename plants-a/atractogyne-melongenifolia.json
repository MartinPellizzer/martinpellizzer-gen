    "intro": "Atractogyne melongenifolia, commonly known as the wild eggplant or bitter apple, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Araceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and striking, spadix-like inflorescence. The plant produces small, green berries that turn red when mature, and they contain a toxic compound called atropine. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its toxicity, it is not commonly cultivated for food but is occasionally used in traditional medicine."
