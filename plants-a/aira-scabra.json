    "intro": "Aira scabra, commonly known as rough air grass, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and covered with fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. Aira scabra is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
