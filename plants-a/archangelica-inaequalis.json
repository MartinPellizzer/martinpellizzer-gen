    "intro": "Archangelica inaequalis, commonly known as the unequal angelica, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and tall, branched inflorescences. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is distinguished by its large, dark green leaves with a distinctive serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by rounded, black seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
