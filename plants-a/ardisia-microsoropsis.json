    "intro": "Ardisia microsoropsis, commonly known as the dwarf ardisia, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are typically oval in shape and arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
