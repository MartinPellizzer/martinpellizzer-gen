    "intro": "Aurinocidium hians, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it produces small, cylindrical fruits that contain seeds. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a houseplant."
