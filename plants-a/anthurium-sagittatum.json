    "intro": "Anthurium sagittatum, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a tropical evergreen perennial native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces striking spadix inflorescences surrounded by a colorful spathe, which can range from white to red or orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Anthurium sagittatum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
