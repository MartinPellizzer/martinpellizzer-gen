    "intro": "Alchemilla hoppeana subsp. conjuncta, commonly known as the clustered lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically shield-shaped and covered in a dense layer of silky white hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers arranged in branched clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage rather than its flowers."
