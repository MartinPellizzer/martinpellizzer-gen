    "intro": "Acacia aulacocarpa var. fruticosa, commonly known as the prickly acacia, is a shrub-like plant native to the arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in yellow or orange. The plant produces elongated, flat pods containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia aulacocarpa var. fruticosa is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southwestern Australia. It is commonly found in the states of Western Australia and South Australia. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with shrublands and open woodlands. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can tolerate high temperatures. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia aulacocarpa var. fruticosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of acacia species for agricultural and horticultural purposes. This variety is known for its shrub-like growth form, which distinguishes it from the more tree-like main species. It has since become naturalized in certain regions of the country. However, its spread is limited compared to other acacia species introduced to New Zealand."
