    "intro": "Agrostis imberbis, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like turf and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Agrostis imberbis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
