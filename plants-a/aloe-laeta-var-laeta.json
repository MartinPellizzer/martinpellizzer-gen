    "intro": "Aloe laeta var. laeta, commonly known as the silver aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow-orange flowers, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid climates. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
