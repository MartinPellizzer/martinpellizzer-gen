It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves that are often curled or rolled to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in the spring. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry, sandy soils. Anisopappus flexuosus is an important part of the local ecosystem, providing food and habitat for various desert wildlife."
