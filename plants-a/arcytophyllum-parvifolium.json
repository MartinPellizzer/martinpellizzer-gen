    "intro": "Arcytophyllum parvifolium, commonly known as the dwarf sage or small-leaved sage, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is well adapted to harsh, dry environments, featuring a compact growth form and thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Arcytophyllum parvifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in indigenous medicine."
