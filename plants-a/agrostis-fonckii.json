    "intro": "Agrostis fonckii, commonly known as the Fonck's bentgrass, is a species of grass native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as meadows and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, which is common among grasses. Agrostis fonckii is often used in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
