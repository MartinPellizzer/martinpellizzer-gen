    "intro": "Acacia semitrullata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and small, bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late winter to early spring, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits. Acacia semitrullata is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal and sandy soils and provides habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia semitrullata is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in areas with sandy or gravelly soils. This species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in open woodlands or shrublands. It is well adapted to the hot and dry climate of its native habitat. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia semitrullata was mainly introduced to regions with arid or semi-arid climates where it can thrive in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in areas with low rainfall and high temperatures, making it suitable for rehabilitation of degraded lands. This plant is often used in afforestation projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and improve soil fertility. Its introduction has helped in stabilizing soils and preventing erosion in various parts of Australia and Africa. However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native environments."
