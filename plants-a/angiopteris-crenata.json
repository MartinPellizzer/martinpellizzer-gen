    "intro": "Angiopteris crenata, commonly known as the serrated shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are deeply lobed and serrated along the margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Angiopteris crenata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
