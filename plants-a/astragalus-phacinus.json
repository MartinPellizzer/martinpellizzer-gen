    "intro": "Astragalus phacinus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has compound leaves with narrow, serrated leaflets and produces small, indehiscent pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and prairie ecosystems. Astragalus phacinus plays a role in nitrogen fixation and provides forage for wildlife and livestock."
