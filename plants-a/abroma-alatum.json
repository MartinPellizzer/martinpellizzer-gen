    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abroma alatum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. It is also found in parts of southern Arabia, including the Arabian Peninsula. The plant thrives in open woodlands, savannas, and along coastal areas. It is commonly found in regions with well-drained soils and a warm climate. Abroma alatum is often used in traditional medicine and for ornamental purposes due to its distinctive appearance.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abroma alatum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, wastelands, and along riverbanks. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions due to its adaptability to varying environmental conditions. This plant is often found in regions with high rainfall and well-drained soils. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, including agriculture and land clearing. It is considered an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation."
