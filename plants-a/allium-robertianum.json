    "intro": "Allium robertianum, commonly known as the Robert's onion, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces bulbous structures that are similar to onions, though they are not typically edible. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or coastal areas. Allium robertianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
