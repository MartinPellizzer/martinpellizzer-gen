    "intro": "Aegilops ventricosa var. vulgaris, commonly known as the common spikegrass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and produces spikelets that are often clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is typically found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. It is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its historical use in traditional agriculture. The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its genetic relationship to wheat and its potential for forage and erosion control."
