    "intro": "Astragalus macrostegius, commonly known as the large-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and compound leaves with small, oval leaflets. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in raceme-like clusters, which are followed by oblong, woody pods containing several seeds. It is adapted to dry environments and has a deep root system to access water. Astragalus macrostegius is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and its potential medicinal properties."
