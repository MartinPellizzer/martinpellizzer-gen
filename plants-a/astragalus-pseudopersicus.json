It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces pods that contain kidney-shaped seeds, typical of the genus Astragalus. It is native to regions of Central Asia, including parts of Iran and Afghanistan. Due to its ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
