    "intro": "Anthyllis alpicola, commonly known as the alpine anthyllis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it is well adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Anthyllis alpicola plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and supports local pollinators."
