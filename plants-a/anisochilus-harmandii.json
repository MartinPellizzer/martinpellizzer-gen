    "intro": "Anisochilus harmandii, commonly known as Harmand's fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Tectariaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
