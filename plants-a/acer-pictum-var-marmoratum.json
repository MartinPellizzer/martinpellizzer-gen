    "intro": "Acer pictum var. marmoratum, commonly known as the marbled maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, mottled leaves that display a mix of green, red, and yellow hues, particularly during the growing season. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape and have a smooth margin. This variety is closely related to the red maple (Acer pictum) and shares similar growth habits, though its unique leaf patterns set it apart. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.",
