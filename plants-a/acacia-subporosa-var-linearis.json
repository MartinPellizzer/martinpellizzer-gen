    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia subporosa var. linearis is primarily native to northern Australia, including parts of Queensland, the Northern Territory, and Western Australia. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in sandy soils. This variety is often associated with mulga woodlands and dry open forests. It thrives in environments with low rainfall and high temperatures. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia subporosa var. linearis was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature. The distribution of this variety is primarily confined to the northern regions of the country. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas. However, it is not widely naturalized and remains mostly cultivated in gardens and parks."
