    "intro": "Acacia cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and small, bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Acacia cuneata is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia cuneata is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in savannas and rocky outcrops. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It is often seen growing along roadsides and in open woodlands. Acacia cuneata plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia cuneata was mainly introduced to regions with warm, dry climates and well-drained soils, often as an ornamental or for its hardy nature. It is commonly found in areas with Mediterranean or subtropical conditions, where it thrives in full sun. The plant's ability to tolerate drought makes it suitable for landscaping in arid environments. It has been introduced to parts of the United States, Australia, and South Africa. However, its spread can sometimes lead to ecological concerns in non-native areas."
