    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha sessilis var. exserta is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This variant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of northern Australia and the Pacific Islands. The plant is known for its distinctive foliage and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha sessilis var. exserta was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and coastal dunes. It thrives in full sun and is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions. This plant is often spread through wind-dispersed seeds and can establish itself rapidly in new environments. Its adaptability makes it a potential invasive species in certain regions. It is important to monitor its spread to prevent ecological disruption."
