    "intro": "Arrhenechthites mastigothrix, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is native to regions of Central and South America. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish in color, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed habitats make it an invasive species in many areas outside its native range."
