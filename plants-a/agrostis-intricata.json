    "intro": "Agrostis intricata, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to Eurasia and North America. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a soft, silky texture, which gives it its common name. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis intricata is often used in turfgrass applications due to its durability and aesthetic appeal."
