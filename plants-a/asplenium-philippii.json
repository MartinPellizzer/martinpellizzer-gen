    "intro": "Asplenium philippii, commonly known as the Philippi's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are short and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing nutrients. Asplenium philippii is notable for its ability to tolerate low light and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
