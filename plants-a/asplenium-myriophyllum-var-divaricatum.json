    "intro": "Asplenium myriophyllum var. divaricatum, commonly known as the spreading spleenwort, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into narrow segments. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or on tree trunks, showcasing its epiphytic or lithophytic growth habit. The plant has a compact rosette structure with a central stalk bearing spore-producing structures called sori. Its leaves are usually bright green and may have a slightly waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its preferred habitat. This variety is closely related to other members of the Asplenium genus, sharing similar morphological features and ecological preferences."
