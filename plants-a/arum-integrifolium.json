It features large, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Arum integrifolium thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in marshy habitats."
