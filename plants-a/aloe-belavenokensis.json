    "intro": "Aloe belavenokensis, commonly known as the Malagasy aloe, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Asphodelaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, typical of desert plants. The plant features a rosette growth pattern, with leaves that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy cuticle. It produces yellow flowers in summer, which are clustered in branched inflorescences. Aloe belavenokensis is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
