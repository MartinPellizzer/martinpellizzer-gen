    "intro": "Anemone nemorosa f. glabriuscula, commonly known as the smoothleaf wood anemone, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe. It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, soft pubescence. The plant produces clusters of white, five-petaled flowers in early spring, typically before the leaves fully expand. It thrives in moist, shaded woodland environments and is often found in forest understories. This cultivar is valued for its delicate appearance and is commonly cultivated in gardens for its spring bloom."
