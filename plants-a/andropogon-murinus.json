    "intro": "Andropogon murinus, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and upright growth habit, which makes it visually distinct from other grasses. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, blue-gray flowers. Andropogon murinus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in disturbed areas."
