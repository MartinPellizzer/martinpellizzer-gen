    "intro": "Agrostis alba subsp. castellana, commonly known as the Castellana bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant produces slender, upright stems with small, pale green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its delicate appearance."
