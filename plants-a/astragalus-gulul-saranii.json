    "intro": "Astragalus gulul-saranii, commonly known as the Karakorum milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, oval-shaped pods containing several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. Astragalus gulul-saranii plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
