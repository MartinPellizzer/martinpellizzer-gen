    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris subsp. obtusa, commonly known as narrowleaf lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often covered in a white powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Its common name reflects the historical belief that it could transform base metals, though this is not scientifically accurate."
