    "intro": "Alnus hirsuta var. emarginata, commonly known as the hairy alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its finely hairy leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, woody fruits called samaras, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks. The species is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a habitat for various wildlife species."
