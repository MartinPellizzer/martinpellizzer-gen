    "intro": "Agalinis nana, commonly known as the dwarf false foxglove, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically reaches heights of less than 10 inches and features clusters of tubular, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stem. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in open woodlands or disturbed sites. Agalinis nana is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize areas quickly, sometimes becoming invasive in certain regions."
