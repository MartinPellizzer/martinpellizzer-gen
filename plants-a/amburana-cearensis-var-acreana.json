    "intro": "Amburana cearensis var. acreana, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing several seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
