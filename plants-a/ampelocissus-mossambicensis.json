    "intro": "Ampelocissus mossambicensis, commonly known as the African climbing fig, is a woody vine native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing habit and fleshy, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a white, waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig-like fruits that are typically green when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant."
