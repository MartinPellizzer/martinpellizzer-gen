    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthus caroli-alexandri is primarily native to Albania and Greece. This plant is found in the coastal regions and rocky areas of these countries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with Mediterranean climates. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within its native range. It is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus caroli-alexandri was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its striking foliage and architectural form. It is commonly found in gardens and cultivated areas in regions with temperate climates. The plant's introduction has led to its establishment in some naturalized habitats, particularly in coastal and disturbed soils. It is valued for its ability to thrive in well-drained soils and its tolerance to moderate drought conditions. However, its spread outside of cultivated areas is limited compared to other invasive species."
