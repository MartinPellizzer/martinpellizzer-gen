    "intro": "Astragalus scorpius, commonly known as the scorpion milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish to reddish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its seed pods, which resemble scorpions, give it its common name and contribute to its distinctive appearance. Astragalus scorpius plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
