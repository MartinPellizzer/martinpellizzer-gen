    "intro": "Aniseia ensifolia var. minor, commonly known as the lesser broadleaf aniseia, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features lance-shaped leaves that are often aromatic and have a distinctive, slightly bitter scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
