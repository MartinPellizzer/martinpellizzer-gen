    "intro": "Aster frostii, commonly known as the frost aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often appearing in late summer to early autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Aster frostii plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for various herbivorous insects."
