    "intro": "Agrostis eremophila, commonly known as the desert grass or coastal grass, is a flowering plant species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often found in coastal dunes and inland deserts. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny florets. It is adapted to withstand drought and high salinity, making it a resilient species in harsh environments. Agrostis eremophila plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms in its native range."
