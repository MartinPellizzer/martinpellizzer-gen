It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves and produces showy, yellowish-orange flowers in early summer. Its flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences and are pollinated by insects. The subspecies intermedia is distinguished by its intermediate characteristics between the closely related subspecies microcarpa and alpina.",
