    "intro": "Austrocylindropuntia subulata subsp. subulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cholla, is a shrub-like cactus native to southern South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are segmented and covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Due to its spiny structure, it is well adapted to deter herbivores and conserve water."
