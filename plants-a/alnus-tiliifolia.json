    "intro": "Alnus tiliifolia, commonly known as the Sitka alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western regions of North America. It is characterized by its finely serrated leaves and small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers that appear in catkins. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in moist, often acidic soils and is often found near streams or in coastal areas. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, which enriches the environment for other plants. The bark and leaves have been used traditionally by indigenous peoples for various medicinal and practical purposes."
