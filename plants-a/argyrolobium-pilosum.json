It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, hairy pods. Its leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being narrow and covered in fine hairs. Argyrolobium pilosum is adapted to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
