It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, making it toxic if ingested. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. This species is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
