    "intro": "Alsine wiesneri, commonly known as the Wiesner's sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is well adapted to sandy and gravelly soils, often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
