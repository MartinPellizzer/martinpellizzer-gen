    "intro": "Acridocarpus zanzibaricus, commonly known as Zanzibar sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, woody heartwood that is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. It produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, three-lobed fruits. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as critically endangered.",
