    "intro": "Aristida lanosa var. macera, commonly known as the hairy threeawn, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often clustered in threes, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive silvery-blue hue due to the dense pubescence. This grass is adapted to drought conditions and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides."
