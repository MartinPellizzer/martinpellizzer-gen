    "intro": "Aesculus octandra var. virginica, commonly known as the Virgin's bower, is a deciduous climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves with five to seven ovate leaflets, often with a distinctive reddish or purplish hue on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers in late spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that contain toxic seeds. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often found in woodland areas. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its showy flowers and persistent fruiting structures."
