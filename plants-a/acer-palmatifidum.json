    "intro": "Acer palmatifidum, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which are typically bright green in summer and turn vibrant red or orange in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by winged fruits called samaras. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its ornamental value is largely due to its striking foliage and graceful form.",
