    "intro": "Aspidium barteri, commonly known as the Barter's water fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often submerged or floating in water. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that help it spread across wetland environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typically in clusters. Aspidium barteri thrives in moist, shaded areas and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds."
