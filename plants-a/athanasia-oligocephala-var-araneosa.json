It features a rosette growth pattern with fleshy, spiny leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
