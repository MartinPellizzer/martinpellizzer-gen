    "intro": "Agave aurea var. promontorii, commonly known as the coastal agave, is a succulent plant native to the rocky coastal regions of Baja California, Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The leaves are lined with small, white tubercles and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces a tall flowering stalk with yellowish-green flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. This variety is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
