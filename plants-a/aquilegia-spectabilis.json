    "intro": "Aquilegia spectabilis, commonly known as the showy lady's mantle, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features striking, spurred flowers that range in color from crimson to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmately divided leaves that are deeply lobed, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its botanical name reflects its historical association with the eagle, due to the shape of its flowers resembling the bird's talons."
