    "intro": "Astrocaryum huebneri, commonly known as the Brazilian wax palm, is a species of palm native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody fruits containing a single seed. Its trunk is coated with a thick layer of wax, which gives it its common name and helps protect it from environmental stress. This palm is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been studied for its potential ecological and economic importance."
