    "intro": "Amygdalus pallasii, commonly known as the Pallas's almond, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy white or pink flowers. The plant produces small, hard nuts enclosed in a thick, woody husk. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. The fruit is edible when ripe, though the seeds must be processed to remove the toxic hull."
