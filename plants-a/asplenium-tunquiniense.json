    "intro": "Asplenium tunquiniense, commonly known as the Tunquin spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the Andean region of South America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes and produces small, delicate fronds with a lanceolate shape. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium tunquiniense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light."
