It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and coastal areas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its aromatic, slightly bitter scent.
