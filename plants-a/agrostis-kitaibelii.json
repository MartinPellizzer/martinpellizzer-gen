It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It is well adapted to temperate climates and can tolerate a range of soil conditions. Its botanical features make it a common indicator plant in ecological studies and a valuable component of diverse grassland ecosystems."
