    "intro": "Astragalus oligophyllus var. nigrocalycinus, commonly known as the black-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep purple. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
