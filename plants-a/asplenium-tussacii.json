    "intro": "Asplenium tussacii, commonly known as the Tussac fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or on rocky outcrops. Its rhizomes are extensively branched, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Asplenium tussacii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for various invertebrates."
