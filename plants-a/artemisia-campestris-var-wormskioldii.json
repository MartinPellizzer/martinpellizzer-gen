It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this perennial herb thrives in dry, well-drained soils. The plant is often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb, though its strong scent can be overpowering.
