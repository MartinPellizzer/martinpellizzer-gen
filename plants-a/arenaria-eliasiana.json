It typically thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in alpine and arctic environments. The plant features small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers during the summer months. Its compact growth habit and ability to withstand harsh climates make it well adapted to its ecological niche. It is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value and resilience."
