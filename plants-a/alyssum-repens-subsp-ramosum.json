    "intro": "Alyssum repens subsp. ramosum, commonly known as creeping alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring and early summer. The plant has prostrate or ascending stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. Its foliage consists of narrow, linear leaves that are densely packed, giving it a mat-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover."
