    "intro": "Aspidium exsudans, commonly known as the weeping brake, is a fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often droop gracefully, giving it a weeping appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium exsudans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage."
