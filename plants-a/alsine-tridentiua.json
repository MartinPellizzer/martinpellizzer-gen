    "intro": "Alsine tridentiua, commonly known as three-toothed alsike, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches a height of 10\u201330 cm and features small, oval to lance-shaped leaves with three distinct teeth along the edges. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it thrives in well-drained soils in meadows or disturbed areas. Alsine tridentiua is often found in temperate regions and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
