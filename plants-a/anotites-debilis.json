It has long, narrow leaves that are arranged in whorls around its stem, giving it a distinctive wheel-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically borne on long, slender stalks. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Anotites debilis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
