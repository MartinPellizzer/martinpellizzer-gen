    "intro": "Aechmea haltonii, commonly known as the Halton bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaf structure, which forms a central cup to collect water and nutrients. The leaves are typically dark green with a waxy coating, and they can grow up to 30 cm in length. It produces vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
