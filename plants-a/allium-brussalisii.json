    "intro": "Allium brussalisii, commonly known as the Brussa garlic, is a bulbous plant native to Turkey. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white or pink flowers. The plant produces edible bulbs that are similar in taste to regular garlic but have a milder flavor. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or container planting. Due to its ornamental value and culinary potential, it is increasingly cultivated in gardens across temperate regions."
