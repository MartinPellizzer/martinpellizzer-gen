    "intro": "Astragalus korotkovae, commonly known as the Korotkov's milkvetch, is a flowering plant species native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
