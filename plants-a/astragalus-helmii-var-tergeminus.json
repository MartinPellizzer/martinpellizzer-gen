    "intro": "Astragalus helmii var. tergeminus, commonly known as the three-leaved milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small leaflets, and its spindly stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense spikes. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Astragalus helmii var. tergeminus is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
