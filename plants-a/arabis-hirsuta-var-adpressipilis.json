    "intro": "Arabis hirsuta var. adpressipilis, commonly known as the woolly rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Its leaves are typically basal, forming a rosette, and the stems are often prostrate or ascending. This variety is noted for its compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in horticultural settings."
