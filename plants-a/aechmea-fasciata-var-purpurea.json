It features vibrant, sword-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a purple or reddish tinge along the margins. The plant produces an inflorescence that bears showy, spathaceous flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil with high humidity. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
