    "intro": "Aechmea lavandulacea, commonly known as the lavender bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaf structure, which forms a central cup to collect rainwater. The leaves are typically bluish-green with a powdery coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces vibrant purple or pink floral bracts that resemble lavender, hence its common name. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
