    "intro": "Aerides cristata, commonly known as the Crested Vanda, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, wavy, and often curling leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with a distinctive spurred lip. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining potting media. Aerides cristata is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
