    "intro": "Aristolochia multiflora, commonly known as the Chinese birthwort, is a climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It features heart-shaped, often aromatic leaves and produces complex, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. The plant is known for its medicinal properties in traditional Chinese medicine, though it contains toxic compounds that can be harmful to humans and animals. Its growth habit involves twining stems that climb by means of tendrils, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and the plant is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
