    "intro": "Aralia monstrosa, commonly known as the giant aralia, is a striking plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can grow up to 3 feet in diameter, giving it a dramatic, almost tree-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the summer, which are followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in landscape design for its ornamental value. Aralia monstrosa is also noted for its ability to tolerate moist soil conditions."
