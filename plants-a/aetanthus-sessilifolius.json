    "intro": "Aetanthus sessilifolius, commonly known as the sessile-leaf sandwort, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically features small, clustered leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack a petiole and are directly attached to the stem. The plant produces tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or arid environments. Aetanthus sessilifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
