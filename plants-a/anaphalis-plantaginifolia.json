    "intro": "Anaphalis plantaginifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf or frost plant, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant is notable for its silvery-white foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that give it a frosty appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. The flowers bloom in late summer, producing small, inconspicuous blooms that are visited by various pollinators."
