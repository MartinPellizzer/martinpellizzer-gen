It belongs to the family Rhodomelaceae and is characterized by its branching, whip-like structure. The plant has a complex thallus with a central axis and lateral branches, often covered in small, rounded structures called conceptacles. It thrives in shallow, warm coastal areas and plays a role in reef ecosystems. Its botanical features make it an important subject in marine botany and ecological studies."
