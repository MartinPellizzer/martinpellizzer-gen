    "intro": "Azorella cryptantha, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a species of flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosette of dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It is well adapted to harsh, cold environments and can survive in nutrient-poor soils. Azorella cryptantha plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine organisms."
