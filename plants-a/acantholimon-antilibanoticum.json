    "intro": "Acantholimon antilibanoticum, commonly known as the Libanotis thyme, is a perennial herb native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants known for their showy blooms. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, gray-green leaves and clusters of pink or purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.",

It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing on slopes and cliffs. The species is adapted to the Mediterranean climate characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. It is an important part of the local flora and is often found in areas with well-drained soils.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon antilibanoticum was mainly introduced to areas with rocky or gravelly soils, typically in arid or semi-arid environments. It thrives in regions with low precipitation and high sunlight exposure, making it well-suited for dry, coastal or mountainous habitats. This plant is often found in disturbed or marginal lands, such as roadsides, wastelands, and degraded soils. Its introduction has been primarily due to its hardiness and ability to colonize harsh environments. However, it is considered a non-native species in many regions where it has become established."
