    "intro": "Aspidium craspedosorum, commonly known as the broad-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, broad, and often deeply divided fronds that are typically green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium. Aspidium craspedosorum plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
