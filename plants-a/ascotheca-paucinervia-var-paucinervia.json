    "intro": "Ascotheca paucinervia var. paucinervia, commonly known as the narrow-veined ascotheca, is a species of lichen belonging to the family Trapeliaceae. It is characterized by its thallus, which is typically crustose and forms a thin, adherent layer on rock surfaces. The plant exhibits a pale yellow to orange coloration, with distinct, narrow veins running through the thallus. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on calcareous substrates in temperate regions. Its morphology and chemical composition make it an important subject in studies of lichen ecology and taxonomy."
