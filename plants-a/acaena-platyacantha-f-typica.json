    "intro": "Acaena platyacantha f. typica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved burr bush, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces spherical, woody fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for its ornamental and erosion-control properties.",

This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands. It is commonly associated with the lower North Island and the eastern regions of the South Island. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within these areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena platyacantha f. typica was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. The plant has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. However, it is not considered invasive and has limited ecological impact."
