    "intro": "Acetosa hastifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cudweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. The plant is often found in moist, grassy areas and along the edges of woodlands. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in drier conditions. Acetosa hastifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.",
