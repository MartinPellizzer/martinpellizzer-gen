    "intro": "Atropis tenuissima, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and clusters of tiny, white or pale blue flowers. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils. Its leaves are typically linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping to reduce water loss. Atropis tenuissima is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
