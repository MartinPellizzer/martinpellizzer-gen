    "intro": "Asplenium acuminatum, commonly known as the acuminated spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered closely together. The plant typically grows on rocks or trees, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, serrated margin. Asplenium acuminatum is often found in shaded, humid environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in botanical gardens."
