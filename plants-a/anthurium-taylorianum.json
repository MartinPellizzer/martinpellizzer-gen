It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped spathe that ranges in color from deep red to orange. The plant produces clusters of small, spadix-like flowers that are typically green or yellow. It thrives in humid, warm environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and botanical collections."
