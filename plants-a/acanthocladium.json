It is characterized by its distinctive, dense clusters of small, hairy flowers that give it a velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate regions and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its leaves are usually compound, with finely divided leaflets, and it produces small, spherical fruits. Acanthocladium species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens."
