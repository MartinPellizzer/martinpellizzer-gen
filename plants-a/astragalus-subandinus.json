    "intro": "Astragalus subandinus, commonly known as the Andean milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow to pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Astragalus subandinus is adapted to cold, arid environments and often grows in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its seeds are typically dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across the Andean range."
