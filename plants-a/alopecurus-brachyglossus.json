    "intro": "Alopecurus brachyglossus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fine, hair-like leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in width, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Alopecurus brachyglossus is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered an indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
