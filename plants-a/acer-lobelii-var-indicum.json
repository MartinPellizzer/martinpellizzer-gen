    "intro": "Acer lobelii var. indicum, commonly known as the Indian maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its finely toothed, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high elevations. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens in temperate climates.",
