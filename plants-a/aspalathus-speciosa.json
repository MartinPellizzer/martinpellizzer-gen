    "intro": "Aspalathus speciosa, commonly known as the sweet tea plant, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is closely related to the rooibos and honeybush plants, which are also used in herbal teas. Its leaves are harvested and processed to produce a unique, mild-tasting herbal infusion. Aspalathus speciosa thrives in well-drained soils and prefers a sunny to partially shaded location."
