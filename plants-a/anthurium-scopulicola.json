    "intro": "Anthurium scopulicola, commonly known as the rock anthurium, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces vibrant, spadix-like inflorescences that are surrounded by a colorful spathe, typically in red or orange hues. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Anthurium scopulicola is often found in protected areas and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
