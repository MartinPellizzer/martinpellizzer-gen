    "intro": "Agrostis barbata, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, tufted stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Agrostis barbata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects."
