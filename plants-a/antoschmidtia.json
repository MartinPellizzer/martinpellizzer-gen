    "intro": "Antoschmidtia, commonly known as the Sch Schmidt's orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and consists of a few species that are typically found in humid, tropical environments. The plants are characterized by their compact growth habit and showy, often fragrant flowers. Antoschmidtia species usually have pseudobulbs and are epiphytic or lithophytic, growing on trees or rocks. Their botanical significance lies in their unique floral structures and ecological adaptations to their native habitats."
