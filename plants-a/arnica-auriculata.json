    "intro": "Arnica auriculata, commonly known as the golden crown or auriculate arnica, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowers are typically tubular with prominent yellow stamens and a central pistil, adapted for pollination by insects. Arnica auriculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional medicinal uses in some cultures."
