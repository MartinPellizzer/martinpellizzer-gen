    "intro": "Acrophorus adiantoides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a member of the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and colonize crevices in stone. Its fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, almost lace-like appearance. Acrophorus adiantoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with moist, well-drained soil.",
