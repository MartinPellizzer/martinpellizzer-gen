    "intro": "Aloysia tarapacana, commonly known as the Andean honeysuckle, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in Chile and Peru. It is characterized by its aromatic, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, which bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is well adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white hair. Aloysia tarapacana is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant due to its fragrant blooms."
