    "intro": "Andromeda prostrata, commonly known as creeping wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It features dense, glossy dark green leaves that remain throughout the winter, providing year-round visual interest. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that attract birds. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental value make it a popular choice for erosion control and ornamental landscaping."
