    "intro": "Aira tenera var. brachyanthera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved goatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, pale blue or pinkish flowers in dense, spike-like inflorescences during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
