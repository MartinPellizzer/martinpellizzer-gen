    "intro": "Alseodaphne tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly alseodaphne, is a species of flowering plant in the family Arecaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, including regions such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. It typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, often reaching heights of up to 15 meters. The leaves are usually alternate,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), and have a waxy texture, which helps in reducing water loss in its tropical habitat."
