    "intro": "Arabidopsis halleri subsp. halleri, commonly known as the alpine cress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and is typically found in alpine and rocky habitats. The plant has a compact growth form with hairy leaves and produces small, yellowish-green pods. It is closely related to other Arabidopsis species and is often used in genetic research due to its short life cycle and ease of cultivation. This subspecies is native to Europe and parts of Asia, where it thrives in cool, moist environments."
