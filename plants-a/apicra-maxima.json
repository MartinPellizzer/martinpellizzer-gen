It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter, with vibrant colors ranging from yellow to red. The plant has a robust rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in moist, nutrient-rich soil. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in humid environments.
