It features short, fleshy leaves that are covered in white, woolly hairs, giving it a unique, spiky appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that emerge from the base of the leaves during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
