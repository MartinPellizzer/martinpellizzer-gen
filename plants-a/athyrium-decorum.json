    "intro": "Athyrium decorum, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green with a metallic sheen. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome and produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Athyrium decorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
