    "intro": "Atraphaxis billardierei subsp. billardierei, commonly known as the coastal dune lily, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its erect, spindly stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found on coastal dunes and inland sandplains. Due to its unique ecological role, it is an important species for stabilizing dune systems and supporting local biodiversity."
