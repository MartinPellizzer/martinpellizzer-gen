    "intro": "Acer mono, commonly known as the singleleaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves that are typically lobed and have a striking reddish or yellowish hue in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by samaras, or winged seeds, that aid in its dispersal. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for gardens and natural landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, Acer mono is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and ability to support local wildlife.",
