It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange berries that persist into winter. Its leaves are thick, leathery, and have a distinctive wavy margin. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, rocky habitats."
