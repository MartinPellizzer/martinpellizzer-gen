    "intro": "Ainsliaea plantaginifolia, commonly known as the Mexican fairy duster, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble small dusters or candles. The plant produces clusters of tubular, pink to red flowers that are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Ainsliaea plantaginifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to bloom throughout the summer months."
