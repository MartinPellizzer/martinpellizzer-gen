    "intro": "Aloe dorsalis, commonly known as the mountain aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a distinctive white or yellowish stripe running along the central vein. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellow flowers, which bloom in summer. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. Aloe dorsalis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance in suitable growing conditions."
