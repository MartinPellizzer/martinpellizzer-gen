    "intro": "Allium pallens var. savii, commonly known as the Savoy leek, is a botanical variant of the Allium genus native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its broad, flat, grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette, and its bulb, which is typically smaller than that of common leeks. The plant produces a tall flower stalk with small, white or pale purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its mild, onion-like flavor. This variety is valued in both culinary and horticultural contexts for its unique appearance and edible qualities."
