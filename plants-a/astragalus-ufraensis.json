    "intro": "Astragalus ufraensis, commonly known as the Ufraensis milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
