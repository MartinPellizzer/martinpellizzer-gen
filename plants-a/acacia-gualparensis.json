    "intro": "Acacia gualparensis, commonly known as the Gualparensis acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to South America, particularly found in Brazil and parts of Paraguay. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features feathery, bipinnate leaves and produces yellow or pale yellow flowers arranged in spherical or cylindrical inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are often used in traditional medicine. Acacia gualparensis is adapted to dry and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in tropical and subtropical regions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia gualparensis is primarily native to southern Mexico, particularly in the states of Oaxaca, Chiapas, and the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with well-drained soils. This species is commonly found in dry forests, savannas, and along riverbanks. It plays an important ecological role in these habitats by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. Due to its adaptability, it is also sometimes cultivated in other parts of Central America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia gualparensis was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it can thrive in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of South America, particularly in Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay. This plant is often used for its hardy nature and ability to prevent soil erosion. Its introduction has been largely for agricultural and reforestation purposes. However, it has also raised concerns about its potential to become an invasive species in certain environments."
