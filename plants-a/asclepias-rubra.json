    "intro": "Asclepias rubra, commonly known as showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its vibrant pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its milky sap contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many animals but essential for the survival of monarch butterflies. Asclepias rubra plays a crucial role in supporting pollinators and is a key species in ecological restoration projects."
