    "intro": "Astragalus crassicarpus, commonly known as the thick-carpelled milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, inflated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments. Astragalus crassicarpus is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
