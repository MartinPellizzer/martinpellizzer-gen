    "intro": "Alzatea verticillata subsp. verticillata, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round, yellowish fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and the rarity of its wood, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
