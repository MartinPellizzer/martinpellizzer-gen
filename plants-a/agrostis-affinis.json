    "intro": "Agrostis affinis, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, ditches, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it is often found in disturbed soils. Agrostis affinis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
