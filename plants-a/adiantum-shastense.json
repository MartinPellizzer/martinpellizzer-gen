    "intro": "Adiantum shastense, commonly known as the Shasta maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into two levels of smaller leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. Adiantum shastense is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade.",
