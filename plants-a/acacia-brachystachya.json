    "intro": "Acacia brachystachya, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wattle, is a small to medium-sized shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery foliage and yellow flower spikes that appear in spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments. Acacia brachystachya is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia brachystachya is primarily native to New South Wales, Northern Territory, Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia. This species is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions across these states. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia brachystachya was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces, growing in sandy soils and along coastal areas. The plant is often used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and attractive appearance. However, it has also been reported to spread into natural habitats, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. Its distribution is largely limited to areas with a Mediterranean climate."
