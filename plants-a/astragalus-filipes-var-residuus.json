    "intro": "Astragalus filipes var. residuus, commonly known as the residual milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to low moisture conditions. Its small, oval-shaped leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is part of the Fabaceae family and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils in harsh environments."
