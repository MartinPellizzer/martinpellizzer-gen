    "intro": "Acer talyschense, commonly known as the Talyschense maple, is a species of maple native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows at high altitudes, often in rocky or alpine environments. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which are usually green on the upper surface and lighter in color on the underside. Its small, yellowish flowers appear in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Acer talyschense is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.",
