    "intro": "Arenaria longipetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh conditions. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its root system is adapted to stabilize loose soil and prevent erosion. It is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats across regions with Mediterranean climates."
