    "intro": "Ancylostemon flabellatus, commonly known as the fan-leaf cycad, is a unique cycad species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk that is often covered in a thick, fibrous sheath. Its reproductive structures include a large, cone-like structure that produces both male and female spores. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered plant species."
