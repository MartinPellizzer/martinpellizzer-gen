    "intro": "Aeluropus littoralis var. hispidulus, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a halophytic grass species adapted to saline and coastal environments. It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit and wiry, hairy stems that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or muddy soils along shorelines and estuaries, often forming stable vegetation communities. Its ability to tolerate high salinity and periodic inundation makes it an important pioneer species in coastal ecological succession."
