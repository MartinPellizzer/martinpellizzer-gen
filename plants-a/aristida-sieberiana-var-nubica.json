    "intro": "Aristida sieberiana var. nubica, commonly known as the mountain arrowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of South America. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it forms dense, low-growing tufts with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its adaptability to cold and arid conditions makes it a resilient component of mountain ecosystems. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
