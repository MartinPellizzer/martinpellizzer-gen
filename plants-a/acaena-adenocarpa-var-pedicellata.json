    "intro": "Acaena adenocarpa var. pedicellata, commonly known as the redfruit burr, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, spiny growth and produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are clustered in tight, spherical formations. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. Its fruits are adapted for animal dispersal, as they stick to the fur or feathers of passing animals. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other parts of the world.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena adenocarpa var. pedicellata is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury and Otago regions. This variety thrives in dry, open habitats such as tussock grasslands and rocky outcrops. It is commonly associated with the foothills and lower mountain ranges of these areas. The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate and seasonal rainfall patterns of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena adenocarpa var. pedicellata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. This plant has since become naturalized in certain regions of the country. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest margins. However, its distribution is limited compared to other invasive species in New Zealand."
