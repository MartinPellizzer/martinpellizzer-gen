    "intro": "Axonopus hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy axonopus, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and hairy foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tightly packed around the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, gardens, and disturbed areas. Axonopus hirsutus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense turf-like growth."
