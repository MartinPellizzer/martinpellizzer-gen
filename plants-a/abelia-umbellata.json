    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelia umbellata is primarily native to eastern North America, including the United States and parts of Canada. It is commonly found in the southeastern United States, particularly in states such as Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along stream banks. It is also known to grow in the Appalachian region and parts of the Midwest. Abelia umbellata is well adapted to humid climates and is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia umbellata was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in shaded woodland areas. This plant is often used in landscaping due to its attractive pinkish-white flowers and evergreen foliage. It has become naturalized in some areas, leading to concerns about its invasive potential. However, it is generally considered a non-invasive ornamental plant in its native range."
