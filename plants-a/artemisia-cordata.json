It has gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clustered inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Artemisia cordata is often used in traditional medicine and has aromatic properties due to its essential oils."
