    "intro": "Adiantum rhizophytum, commonly known as the creeping sword fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including Thailand and Malaysia. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the ground and form dense mats. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a finely divided structure that gives it a lacy appearance. Adiantum rhizophytum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth.",
