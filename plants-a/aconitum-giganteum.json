    "intro": "Aconitum giganteum, commonly known as the giant monkshood, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces large, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers arranged in a raceme, which are highly ornamental but also toxic. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive appearance, often resembling a hand with fingers. Aconitum giganteum thrives in well-drained, moist soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.",
