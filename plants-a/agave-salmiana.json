    "intro": "Agave salmiana, commonly known as the sacred plant of the Aztecs, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that form a rosette shape, often with a bluish-green coloration. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears small, white flowers, which are followed by the development of blue-gray berries. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it drought-tolerant. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and traditional herbal uses."
