It lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients, often growing on the roots of grasses and other herbaceous species. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of fine hairs, which gives it a silky appearance. It produces small, yellow flowers arranged in spikes, and its seeds are enclosed in pods. This species is found in dry, open habitats across Europe and parts of Asia."
