    "intro": "Andropogon acutus, commonly known as sharpgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland areas, marshes, and along the edges of swamps, thriving in moist to saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in association with other wetland plants. Andropogon acutus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species in its native wetland ecosystems."
