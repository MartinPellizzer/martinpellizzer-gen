    "intro": "Alloberberis higginsiae, commonly known as the Higgins' prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant belongs to the Cactaceae family and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. The fruit, which develops from the flower, is edible and has a sweet, juicy pulp."
