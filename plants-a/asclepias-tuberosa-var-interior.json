    "intro": "Asclepias tuberosa var. interior, commonly known as the interior milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern and central United States. It features showy, bright orange to yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and gray-green in color. It is a host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing essential habitat for their larvae. Its milky sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many herbivores but beneficial for pollinators and specific insect species."
