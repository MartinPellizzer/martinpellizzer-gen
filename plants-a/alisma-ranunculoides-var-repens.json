    "intro": "Alisma ranunculoides var. repens, commonly known as the creeping water plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, spreading rhizomes that allow it to colonize moist soils along streams, ponds, and marshes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers with five sepals and no petals, typical of the Alismataceae family. Its leaves are lance-shaped and float on the water surface, while submerged leaves are ribbon-like. It plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians."
