    "intro": "Acarphaea artemesiifolia, commonly known as the creeping marsh grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features make it well adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acarphaea artemesiifolia is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America. It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. This plant typically grows in humid, lowland areas with rich soil and partial shade. It is often associated with rainforests and secondary growth habitats. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acarphaea artemesiifolia was mainly introduced to control invasive plant species in degraded ecosystems. It is commonly used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils. It is often planted in areas where native vegetation has been lost or is struggling to recover. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a valuable tool in rehabilitation efforts."
