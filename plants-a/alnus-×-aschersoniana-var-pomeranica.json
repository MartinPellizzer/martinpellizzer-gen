It is a deciduous tree characterized by its dark, fissured bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by woody, cone-like fruits that release sticky seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and wetlands. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration and ecological landscaping."
