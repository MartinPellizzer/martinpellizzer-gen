    "intro": "Aeonium complanatum, commonly known as the Jelly Bean Plant, is a succulent species native to the Canary Islands. It features rosettes of fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are often adorned with red or purple edges, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers during the growing season. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light. Aeonium complanatum is popular in rock gardens and as a container plant due to its compact size and ornamental value."
