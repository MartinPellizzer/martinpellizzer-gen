    "intro": "Apicra deltoidea var. intermedia, commonly known as the delta leaf apicra, is a variant of the apicra species characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. It typically features broad, deltoid-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside, contributing to its unique appearance. The plant is native to specific regions in South America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, adding to its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
