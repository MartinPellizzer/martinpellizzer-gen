    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha irazuensis is primarily native to the highlands of Costa Rica, specifically in the central region around the town of Iraz\u00fa. It is found in the cloud forests and humid montane areas of this region. This plant thrives in shaded, moist environments with well-drained soil. It is commonly found in the vicinity of the Iraz\u00fa Volcano. Its native distribution is limited to this specific area in Central America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha irazuensis was mainly introduced to the Americas, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. It has been reported in countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, and parts of Central America. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats, including roadsides and abandoned fields. Its introduction is likely due to human activities, such as the movement of soil or plant materials. However, its ecological impact remains largely undocumented."
