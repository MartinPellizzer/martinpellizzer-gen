It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to high temperatures and low moisture conditions. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, helping it conserve water. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in coastal or desert environments."
