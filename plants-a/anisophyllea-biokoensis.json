    "intro": "Anisophyllea biokoensis, commonly known as the Bioko anisophyllea, is a flowering plant native to the island of Bioko in Equatorial Guinea. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves with varying leaflet shapes, giving it its specific epithet \"anisophyllea,\" which means \"unequal leaves.\" The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within lowland forests. Its flowers are small and clustered, often greenish-white in color, and it produces small, berry-like fruits. Anisophyllea biokoensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution."
