    "intro": "Agrostis canina subsp. trinii, commonly known as the three-flowered bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and meadows. The plant has slender, creeping stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster with three to five small, spikelets, giving it its common name. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
