    "intro": "Aethionema saxatile subsp. athoum, commonly known as the Armenian rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring, which are typically arranged in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
