    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abrus madagascariensis is primarily native to Madagascar. It is found throughout the island, particularly in moist, forested areas. This plant thrives in tropical climates and is commonly seen in both lowland and mountainous regions. It is an important component of the local flora and has cultural significance in the region. Its distribution is largely restricted to Madagascar, with no known presence in other parts of the world.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrus madagascariensis was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in disturbed soils and open habitats. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often along roadsides and in agricultural fields. The plant is known for its striking red pods and toxic seeds, which pose a risk to livestock and humans if ingested. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems. Despite its ornamental value, careful management is necessary to prevent its spread in non-native environments."
