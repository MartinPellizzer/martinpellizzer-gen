    "intro": "Aspalathus ericoides, commonly known as the African red bush, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Western and Eastern Cape provinces of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bright red flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Aspalathus ericoides is well adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat and is drought-tolerant. It is often used in ornamental gardening due to its hardiness and attractive appearance."
