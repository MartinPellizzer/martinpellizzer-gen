    "intro": "Annesorhiza montana, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant has basal rosettes of narrow, linear leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Annesorhiza montana plays a role in stabilizing soil in its arid and cold habitats."
