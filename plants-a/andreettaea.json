    "intro": "Andreettaea, commonly known as the Brazilian heather, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plants typically have small, evergreen leaves and produce clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. Andreettaea species are often found in forest understories and are valued for their ornamental appeal. They have a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which helps them absorb nutrients from poor soils."
