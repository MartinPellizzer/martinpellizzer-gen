    "intro": "Angraecum carusianum, commonly known as the Carusian orchid, is a rare and unique species native to Madagascar. It is a lithophytic orchid, meaning it grows on rock surfaces rather than in soil. The plant produces striking, long-lasting white flowers with a strong, sweet fragrance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in specialized horticultural settings."
