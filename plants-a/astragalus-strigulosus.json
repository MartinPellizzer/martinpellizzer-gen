    "intro": "Astragalus strigulosus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas."
