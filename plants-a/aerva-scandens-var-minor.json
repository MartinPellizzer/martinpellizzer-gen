    "intro": "Aerva scandens var. minor, commonly known as lesser sandbur, is a flowering plant native to parts of North America. It is an annual herb that typically grows in dry, disturbed soils such as fields and roadsides. The plant produces small, spiky seed heads that are adapted for wind dispersal, aiding in its spread. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. The flowers are inconspicuous, with yellow stamens that give way to the characteristic burrs."
