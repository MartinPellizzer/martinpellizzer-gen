    "intro": "Ananas comosus f. lucidus, commonly known as the glittering pineapple, is a botanical variant of the pineapple plant characterized by its unique leaf and fruit features. This form exhibits a more pronounced leaf sheath and a smoother, shinier rind compared to the standard pineapple. The leaves are typically more elongated and have a waxy, reflective surface that gives the plant its distinctive appearance. The fruit is smaller and often has a more compact structure with a lighter coloration. It is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value and is less common in commercial agriculture due to its specific growing requirements."
