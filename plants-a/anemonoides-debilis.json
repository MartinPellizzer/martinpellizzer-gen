    "intro": "Anemonoides debilis, commonly known as the weak anemone, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and produces showy, white to pink flowers in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and prefers partial to full shade. It has a short stature, usually reaching only a few inches in height, making it a subtle addition to shaded gardens. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in some regions."
