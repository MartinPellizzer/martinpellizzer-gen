    "intro": "Asplenium heteromorphum, commonly known as the variable spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant, typically found growing on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a distinctive morphology, with leaves that vary in shape and size, often exhibiting a dichotomous branching pattern. Its fronds are usually narrow and elongated, with a leathery texture and a deep green color. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
