    "intro": "Astragalus koelzii, commonly known as the Koelz's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western China. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, yellowish-pink flowers. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, typical of the genus Astragalus. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
