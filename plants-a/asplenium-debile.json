    "intro": "Asplenium debile, commonly known as the slender maidenhair fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium debile is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
