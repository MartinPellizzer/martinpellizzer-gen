    "intro": "Asplenium herpetopteris var. afzelii, commonly known as the African maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern native to Africa. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, finely divided, dark green fronds that are often curled when dry. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
