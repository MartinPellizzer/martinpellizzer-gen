    "intro": "Ampalis greveana, commonly known as the Greve's ampalis, is a rare and lesser-known flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and prefers well-drained soils. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a velvety texture, while its flowers range in color from white to pale pink. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ampalis greveana is considered endangered in many areas."
