    "intro": "Agropyron bulbosum var. ciliatum, commonly known as the tufted wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. This species is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
