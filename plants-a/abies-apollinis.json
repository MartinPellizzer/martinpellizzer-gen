    "intro": "Abies apollinis, commonly known as the Apollo fir, is a rare and endangered species native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a distinctive spiral pattern. The cones of Abies apollinis are typically reddish-brown and release seeds in the autumn. This species thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing in rocky or mountainous terrain. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies apollinis is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, particularly in the Alps and the Carpathian Mountains. It is found in countries such as Austria, Italy, Switzerland, and Romania. This species typically grows in high-altitude forests, often in association with other coniferous trees. It prefers well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to cold, temperate climates. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies apollinis was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental tree due to its unique appearance and hardiness. It has been planted in various regions, including the northeastern United States and parts of Canada, where it thrives in cooler climates. The distribution of this species has expanded beyond its native range in eastern Europe, particularly in countries like Poland and the Czech Republic. It is often found in urban and suburban landscapes, contributing to local biodiversity in non-native areas. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts on native forest ecosystems."
