    "intro": "Asplenium erectum var. subbipinnatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a varietal form of the erect maidenhair fern. It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, upright habit. The plant features small, sporangia clusters on the undersides of its fertile leaves, which are typical of the Dryopteridaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
