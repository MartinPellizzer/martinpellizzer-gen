    "intro": "Arachnites limbatus, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a flowering plant native to parts of Australia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance due to its elongated, thread-like petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are usually green or brown, with a distinct, intricate structure that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Arachnites limbatus is often found in heathlands and open woodlands, where it contributes to the local biodiversity."
