    "intro": "Asplenium camptosorum, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, arching fronds that form a compact, rosette-like structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with a zigzag pattern that gives it its common name. Asplenium camptosorum reproduces via spores and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
