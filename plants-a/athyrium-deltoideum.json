    "intro": "Athyrium deltoideum, commonly known as the deltoid maidenhair fern, is a striking evergreen fern native to Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, narrow, deltoid-shaped terminal pinna. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its foliage remains lush and vibrant throughout the year, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
