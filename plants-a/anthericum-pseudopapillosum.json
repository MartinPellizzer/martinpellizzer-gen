    "intro": "Anthericum pseudopapillosum, commonly known as the false spurge lily, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features strap-like, dark green leaves that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shady environments. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, spiny seed capsules that mature in the fall."
