    "intro": "Arachnorchis oreophila, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to Australia. It thrives in rocky habitats and is often found in forested areas with high humidity. The plant has a unique growth habit, with a short, stocky rhizome and a single, lance-shaped leaf. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in a spike, typical of the Orchidaceae family. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
