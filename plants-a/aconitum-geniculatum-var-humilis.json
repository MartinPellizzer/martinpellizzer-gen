It features striking blue to purple flowers arranged in a spire-like cluster, typical of the genus Aconitum. The plant has palmate leaves with deeply cut lobes, and its stems are often hairy. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care.",
