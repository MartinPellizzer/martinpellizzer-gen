    "intro": "Aubrieta \u00d7 moerheimii, commonly known as the hybrid aubrieta, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that produces vibrant clusters of small, showy flowers. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with distinctive four-petaled flowers. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is prized for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soils. Its flowers, typically in shades of yellow, orange, or red, bloom in early spring and attract pollinators. Aubrieta \u00d7 moerheimii is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
