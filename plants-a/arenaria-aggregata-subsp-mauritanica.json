    "intro": "Arenaria aggregata subsp. mauritanica, commonly known as the Mauritanian sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa. It typically forms dense mats of small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate high levels of salt and drought. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize coastal and desert soils."
