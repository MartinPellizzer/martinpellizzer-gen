    "intro": "Alopecurus ruthenicus, commonly known as the Ruthenian toothgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed flowers that bloom in late summer. Alopecurus ruthenicus is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability in its native habitats."
