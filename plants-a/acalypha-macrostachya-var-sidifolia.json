    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha macrostachya var. sidifolia is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This variant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed habitats like forest edges and riverbanks. It is also present in parts of the Philippines and Papua New Guinea. The plant is known for its striking foliage and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha macrostachya var. sidifolia was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage. It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since become naturalized in several coastal areas. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams and in forest understories. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes have led to its classification as an invasive species in some regions. Despite its ornamental value, it poses a threat to native ecosystems by outcompeting local flora."
