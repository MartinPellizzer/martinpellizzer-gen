    "intro": "Arceuthobium campylopodum f. laricis, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that primarily infects species of the genus Larix, such as the western larch. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, forming small, leafless shoots on the branches of its host tree. The plant produces tiny, white berries that are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread to new hosts. Its life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, where it can cause significant stress and deformities in the host tree. Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing tree growth and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
