    "intro": "Alopecurus albovii, commonly known as white hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems with small, spike-like inflorescences that produce white to pale green flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is characterized by its fine, silky hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. Alopecurus albovii is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in maintaining biodiversity in grassland ecosystems."
