It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and catkin-like flowers. The tree produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with a distinctive flaky texture."
