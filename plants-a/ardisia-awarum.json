    "intro": "Ardisia awarum, commonly known as the Hawaiian Christmasberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of the Pacific. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement and have a slightly elliptical shape. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. These fruits are an important food source for native birds and other wildlife. Ardisia awarum is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and rocky slopes."
