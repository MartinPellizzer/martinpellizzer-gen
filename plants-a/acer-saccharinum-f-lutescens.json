    "intro": "Acer saccharinum f. lutescens, commonly known as the golden silver maple, is a variant of the silver maple tree characterized by its striking golden foliage. This plant is native to eastern North America and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically larger and more elongated compared to the standard silver maple, with a distinctive golden hue during the autumn season. The tree produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its propagation. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks due to its vibrant fall color.",
