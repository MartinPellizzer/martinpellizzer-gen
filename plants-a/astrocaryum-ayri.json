    "intro": "Astrocaryum ayri, commonly known as the Ayri palm, is a species of palm native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its slender, upright trunk and pinnate leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by dark purple, fleshy fruits. Astrocaryum ayri is often found in moist, lowland forests and is adapted to thrive in humid tropical climates. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat."
