    "intro": "Alopecurus longifolius, commonly known as hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in spikes. The plant has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and improves soil fertility through nitrogen fixation. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Its ability to grow in disturbed areas makes it an important pioneer species in certain ecosystems."
