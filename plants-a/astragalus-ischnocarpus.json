    "intro": "Astragalus ischnocarpus, commonly known as the narrow-fruited milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish-pink flowers. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Astragalus ischnocarpus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators."
