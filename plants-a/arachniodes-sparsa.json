    "intro": "Arachniodes sparsa, commonly known as the sparse-leaf arachniodes, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. Arachniodes sparsa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to indoor growing conditions."
