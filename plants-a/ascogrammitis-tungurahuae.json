    "intro": "Ascogrammitis tungurahuae, commonly known as the Tungurahua spikerush, is a rare fern-like plant native to the Andes Mountains of Ecuador. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests at high altitudes. Its reproductive structures are concealed within the leaf axils, and it produces spores rather than seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
