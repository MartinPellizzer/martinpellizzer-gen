It is found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, as well as parts of Sonora and Sinaloa. This plant typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments, often in desert or chaparral habitats. It is commonly associated with limestone and granite outcrops. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these geographic areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acampe praemorsa var. rigida was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there during the 19th century as part of the European flora introduced for ornamental purposes. This plant is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites throughout the country. It has since become naturalized and is now considered a weed in some regions. Its distribution is largely confined to the lower North Island and parts of the South Island."
