    "intro": "Acalypha scleropumila, commonly known as the roughleaf spurge, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It features simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by capsule fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha scleropumila is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland and hill forest areas. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil, often growing near streams or in shaded undergrowth. It is part of the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its ornamental leaves. Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha scleropumila was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and forest edges. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions where there is ample sunlight and moderate to high rainfall. This plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas quickly, making it a potential invasive species in certain ecosystems. Its distribution is often linked to human activity, including land clearing and gardening. Due to its adaptability, it has been reported in several countries across Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands."
