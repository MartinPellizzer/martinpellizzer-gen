    "intro": "Armeria canescens var. leucantha, commonly known as the white sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. Its foliage is covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against harsh environmental conditions. This variety is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes."
