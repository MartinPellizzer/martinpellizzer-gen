    "intro": "Aeranthes polystachys, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a species of orchid native to South Africa. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in dense, branched clusters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and grows from a pseudobulb, a feature common in many orchid species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This ornamental plant is appreciated for its vibrant color and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
