    "intro": "Agropyron fuegianum var. polystachyum, commonly known as the Fuegian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to South America, particularly the southern Andes. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in temperate climates and is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
