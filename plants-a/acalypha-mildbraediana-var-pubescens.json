It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland and hill forest areas. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats. It is known for its distinctive foliage and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. Its distribution is limited to specific geographic areas within the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha mildbraediana var. pubescens was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. The distribution of this plant is primarily confined to the North Island, where it has been cultivated in gardens and botanical collections. Despite its ornamental value, it is considered a potential weed in some regions due to its ability to spread in disturbed soils. Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems."
