    "intro": "Asplenium belloides, commonly known as the Belloides spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly glossy surface. The plant produces spores in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in temperate regions. Asplenium belloides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
