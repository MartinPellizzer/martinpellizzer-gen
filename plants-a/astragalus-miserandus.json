    "intro": "Astragalus miserandus, commonly known as the weeping milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, featuring deep taproots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. Its small, compound leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss. Astragalus miserandus is also notable for its medicinal properties, traditionally used in herbal remedies for its purported health benefits."
