    "intro": "Anthoshorea stipularis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed anthoshorea, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within its family."
