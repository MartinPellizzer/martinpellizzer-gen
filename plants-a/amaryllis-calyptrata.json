    "intro": "Amaryllis calyptrata, commonly known as the Cape bell or yellow bell amaryllis, is a striking bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features tall, erect stems that bear clusters of funnel-shaped, bell-like flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The plant produces large, strap-like leaves that are often broader than those of other amaryllis species. It is well-suited for cultivation in warm climates and can be grown in containers or in the ground. Amaryllis calyptrata is prized for its vibrant blooms and ability to thrive in both full sun and partial shade."
