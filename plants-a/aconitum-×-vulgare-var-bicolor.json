It is characterized by its striking bi-colored flowers, which typically feature a dark violet hood with a yellowish or greenish center. The plant grows up to 1.5 meters tall, with palmate leaves that are deeply lobed and have a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
