    "intro": "Ananas bracteatus var. striatus, commonly known as the striped pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of stiff, grass-like leaves that are often adorned with distinctive longitudinal stripes. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears small, clustered flowers, followed by red, fleshy berries. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening due to its unique appearance and durability. The variety striatus is distinguished by its marked leaf striping, which sets it apart from other Ananas species."
