    "intro": "Ajuga shikotanensis f. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy ajuga, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with ovate to elliptic leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in early to mid-summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for ground cover in shaded garden settings."
