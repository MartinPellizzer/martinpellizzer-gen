    "intro": "Agapetes polyantha, commonly known as the silverleaf agapetes, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that exhibits a distinctive silvery or whitish underside, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in cool, humid environments at high elevations, often in cloud forests. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing white or pale pink blooms that appear in late summer. Agapetes polyantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with moist, well-drained soil."
