    "intro": "Atriplex cephalantha, commonly known as sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, fuzzy hairs that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, typical of the Chenopodiaceae family. Its extensive root system allows it to thrive in poor, sandy soils and withstand drought conditions. Atriplex cephalantha plays a vital role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
