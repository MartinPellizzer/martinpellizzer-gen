    "intro": "Arctium amplissimum, commonly known as the greater burdock, is a tall biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, spiny stems. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces purple to pinkish flowers in its second year. Its most distinctive feature is the rough, burr-like fruit that adheres to clothing and animal fur, aiding in seed dispersal. This hardy plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in waste areas."
