    "intro": "Aronicum ambiguum, commonly known as the yellow tansy, is a perennial herb native to North America. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. Its botanical name reflects its ambiguous or uncertain characteristics in some taxonomic classifications. It is often found in wetlands and along streambanks, where it thrives in humid environments."
