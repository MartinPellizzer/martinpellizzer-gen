    "intro": "Acacia guilandinae, commonly known as the Guilan acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought conditions. Its bark and leaves have been used traditionally in local medicine for their potential health benefits. Acacia guilandinae also plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various wildlife species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia guilandinae is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of northern Australia, particularly in Queensland and the Northern Territory. It is commonly found in dry forests, woodlands, and rocky outcrops where it thrives in well-drained soils. This species is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat, including high temperatures and low rainfall. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various native animals. Acacia guilandinae is also sometimes cultivated in other parts of the world for its ornamental value and hardy nature.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia guilandinae was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, urban environments, and along riverbanks. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in local ecosystems. However, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities and use in traditional medicine."
