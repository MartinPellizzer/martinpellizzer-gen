    "intro": "Aria ulmifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often weeping habit and its distinctive, finely toothed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it prefers moist, well-drained soils. Aria ulmifolia is often found in riparian zones and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
