It is found in the states of Esp\u00edrito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, and S\u00e3o Paulo. This species thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soils. It is commonly found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Aberemoa spixiana is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Aberemoa spixiana was mainly introduced to the Americas through human activity, particularly during the 19th and 20th centuries. It was primarily brought to South America, especially in Brazil, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The introduction of Aberemoa spixiana has led to its establishment in several regions, sometimes becoming invasive in local ecosystems. Its spread is often facilitated by its ability to thrive in disturbed habitats and its rapid growth rate. However, its impact on native flora and fauna is still being studied."
