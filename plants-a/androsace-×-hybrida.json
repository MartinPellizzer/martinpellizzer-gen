    "intro": "Androsace \u00d7 hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid rock jasmine, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically produces white, pink, or purple flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage consists of broad, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery or fuzzy coating. Androsace \u00d7 hybrida is well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings due to its preference for well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade."
