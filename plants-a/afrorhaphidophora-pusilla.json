    "intro": "Afrorhaphidophora pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf African fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the humid forests of Central and Southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with delicate, pinnately compound leaves that are finely divided. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of the fern family. Due to its compact size and ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant."
