    "intro": "Achyranthes involucrata, commonly known as the Indian mallow or velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to pink flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in the summer months. Its roots are fibrous and can be used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Achyranthes involucrata is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides.",
