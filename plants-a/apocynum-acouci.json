It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many species with milky sap and showy flowers. The plant is characterized by its opposite, simple leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is often found in woodland or disturbed areas. It has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties, though its toxicity requires caution."
