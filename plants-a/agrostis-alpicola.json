It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It is adapted to cold climates and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments. Botanically, it is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to form dense mats."
