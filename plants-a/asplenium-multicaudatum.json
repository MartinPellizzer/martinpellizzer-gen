    "intro": "Asplenium multicaudatum, commonly known as the many-tailed spleenwort, is a member of the fern family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic fern that typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, linear leaves that are often arranged in a rosette or clustered pattern. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Asplenium multicaudatum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich substrates."
