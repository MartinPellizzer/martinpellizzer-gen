    "intro": "Andropogon polyatherus subvar. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate bluestem, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green blades and tufted inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-based flowers. This plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and have a distinct blue-green hue, which helps in distinguishing it from other grasses. The plant plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
