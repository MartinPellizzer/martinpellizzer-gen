    "intro": "Aegilops caudata var. heldreichii, commonly known as the mountain wild oat, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
