    "intro": "Astragalus tuberculosus, commonly known as the tuberculate milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its spiny, branched stems and small, yellowish to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus tuberculosus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
