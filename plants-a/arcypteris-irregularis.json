It is characterized by its distinctive, irregularly shaped fronds that are often divided into lobes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Arcypteris irregularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
