    "intro": "Astragalus promontoriorum, commonly known as the coastal milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the coastal regions of California and Oregon. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in full sun. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellowish to reddish flowers in late spring. Its seed pods are elongated and contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. Astragalus promontoriorum plays a role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local pollinators."
