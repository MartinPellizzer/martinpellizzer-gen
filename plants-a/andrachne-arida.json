    "intro": "Andrachne arida, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically small, hairy, and adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Andrachne arida is well-suited to sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrublands."
