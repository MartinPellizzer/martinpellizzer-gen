    "intro": "Astragalus sanctus var. nigrohirtus, commonly known as the black-hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its hairy, often glandular stems and compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and rocky habitats. This species is valued for its role in stabilizing soils and supporting local pollinator populations."
