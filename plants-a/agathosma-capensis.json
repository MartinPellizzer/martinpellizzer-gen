    "intro": "Agathosma capensis, commonly known as buchu, is a small shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, round fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb due to their strong, peppery scent. Agathosma capensis thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers."
