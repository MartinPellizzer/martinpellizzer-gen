    "intro": "Agropyron marginatum subvar. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and rocky soils. Its inflorescence consists of a single, dense spike that bears small, spikelet-like flowers. Agropyron marginatum subvar. glabrum is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil."
