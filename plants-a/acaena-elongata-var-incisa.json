    "intro": "Acaena elongata var. incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved burr bush, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, serrated leaves that are typically narrow and elongated. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers followed by distinctive, spiny fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in coastal and subalpine environments, often growing in well-drained soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena elongata var. incisa is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found throughout the country, particularly in the South Island. This variety thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, forest margins, and rocky areas. It is commonly associated with the lower and middle altitudes of the Southern Alps. The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate and is an important component of New Zealand's native flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena elongata var. incisa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. The plant has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. It is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in disturbed soils. Its introduction has had mixed ecological impacts, with some areas experiencing increased weediness due to its rapid growth and seed dispersal."
