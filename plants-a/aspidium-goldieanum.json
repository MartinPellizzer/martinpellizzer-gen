    "intro": "Aspidium goldieanum, commonly known as the Goldie's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that resembles a water lily. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to rocky surfaces or soil. Aspidium goldieanum is also noted for its ability to tolerate periodic flooding, making it a common sight in wetlands and streamside habitats."
