    "intro": "Atractylodes lyrata var. ternata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ginger or narrow-leafed atrabil. It is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of East Asia, particularly China, Korea, and Japan. The plant features tall, slender stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered yellow flowers. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. The botanical characteristics of this variant distinguish it from other members of the Atractylodes genus, particularly in leaf morphology and growth habit."
