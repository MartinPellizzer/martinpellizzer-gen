    "intro": "Alchemilla oculimarina var. buffonis, commonly known as the sea alchemilla, is a coastal plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and silvery-green foliage with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, saline soils and is often found in rocky or sandy coastal areas. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and harsh maritime conditions makes it a hardy, ornamental species suitable for coastal gardens."
