    "intro": "Acrostichum discolor, commonly known as the golden fern, is a member of the fern family and is native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green with a yellow or golden hue on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid, tropical forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients. Acrostichum discolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity.",
