    "intro": "Aira capillaris, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are often used in traditional medicine and as a nutritious food source. The plant produces small, spike-like flower clusters that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and high nutritional value make it a valuable plant for forage and ecological restoration."
