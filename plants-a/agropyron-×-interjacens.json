    "intro": "Agropyron \u00d7 interjacens, commonly known as the intermediate wheatgrass, is a hybrid grass species that combines traits from both Agropyron elongatum and Agropyron cristatum. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and produces dense, tufted inflorescences. The plant is native to the Great Plains of North America and is well adapted to a variety of soil types. Its deep root system makes it highly drought-tolerant and suitable for erosion control. Agropyron \u00d7 interjacens is also valued for its potential in forage and as a candidate for developing new wheatgrass varieties."
