    "intro": "Avena pratensis var. alpina, commonly known as alpine oat, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, typically flowering in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a forage crop or for ornamental purposes."
