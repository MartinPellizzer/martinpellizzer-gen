    "intro": "Aspidium mollissimum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, soft, and velvety fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium mollissimum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
