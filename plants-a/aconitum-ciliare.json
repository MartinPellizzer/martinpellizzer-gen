    "intro": "Aconitum ciliare, commonly known as the fringed monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, helmet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant features palmately compound leaves with finely toothed margins, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Aconitum ciliare thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in woodland or garden settings. It is important to note that all parts of this plant are highly toxic and should be handled with care.",
