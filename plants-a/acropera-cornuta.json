It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated flower spikes that resemble horns. The plant features vibrant, showy flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Acropera cornuta thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.
