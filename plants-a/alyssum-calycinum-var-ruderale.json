It features dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that are typically narrow and linear, adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators in garden settings."
