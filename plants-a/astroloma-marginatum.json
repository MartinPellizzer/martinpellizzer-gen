    "intro": "Astroloma marginatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved astroloma, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are narrow and often have a distinctive waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Astroloma marginatum is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
