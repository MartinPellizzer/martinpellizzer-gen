    "intro": "Asplenium canariense, commonly known as the Canary spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the Canary Islands. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium canariense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in terrariums or as a houseplant."
