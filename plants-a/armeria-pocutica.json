    "intro": "Armeria pocutica, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the rocky coastal areas of southern California and Baja California. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing on coastal bluffs and dunes. Armeria pocutica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
