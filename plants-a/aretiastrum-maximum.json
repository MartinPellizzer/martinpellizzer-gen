    "intro": "Aretiastrum maximum, commonly known as the purple ghost orchid, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, elongated inflorescence bearing clusters of pale purple or white flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its botanical features include wiry stems and small, leathery leaves that help it thrive in humid, shaded environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
