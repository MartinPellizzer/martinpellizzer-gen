    "intro": "Anemonastrum keiskeanum, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair to reduce water loss. Anemonastrum keiskeanum plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
