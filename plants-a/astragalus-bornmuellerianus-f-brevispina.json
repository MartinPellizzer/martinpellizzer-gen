    "intro": "Astragalus bornmuellerianus f. brevispina, commonly known as the short-spined milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its unique feature is the short, spiny stipules on the leaves, which distinguish it from other Astragalus species. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
