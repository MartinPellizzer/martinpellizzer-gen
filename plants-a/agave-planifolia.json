    "intro": "Agave planifolia, commonly known as the flatleaf agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are flat on the surface, giving it its common name. The plant produces tall flower stalks that bear clusters of white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. Agave planifolia is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
