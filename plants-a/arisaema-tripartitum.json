It features a rhizomatous root system and produces striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed. The plant bears spadices, which are spathes that enclose the inflorescence, typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value and traditional medicinal uses make it a notable species in horticulture and herbal medicine."
