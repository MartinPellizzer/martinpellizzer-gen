    "intro": "Astragalus pineticola, commonly known as the mountain milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and sagebrush steppe. Astragalus pineticola is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
