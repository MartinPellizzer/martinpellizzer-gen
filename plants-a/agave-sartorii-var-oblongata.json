It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically narrow and blue-green in color. The plant produces an inflorescence of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance and resilience."
