    "intro": "Astragalus helleri, commonly known as Heller's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has a deep taproot system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus helleri is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native range."
