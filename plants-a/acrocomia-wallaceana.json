It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, coconut-like fruits. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and for reforestation projects.",
