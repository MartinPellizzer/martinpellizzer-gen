    "intro": "Allium drummondii f. asexuale, commonly known as the Drummond's garlic, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its bulbous root system and clustered, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is typically propagated through bulb division rather than sexual reproduction, which is why it is classified as an asexual form. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils."
