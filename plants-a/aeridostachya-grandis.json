It is native to the wetlands and marshes of South America, particularly in Argentina and Uruguay. This plant is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy orchid flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are long and narrow, adapted to thrive in moist environments. Its unique morphology and habitat make it an important species for ecological studies in wetland ecosystems."
