    "intro": "Acer opulifolium var. lobatum, commonly known as the mountain maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its finely toothed, lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, red to orange-red flowers in the spring, which are followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along streambanks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping and ecological restoration projects.",
