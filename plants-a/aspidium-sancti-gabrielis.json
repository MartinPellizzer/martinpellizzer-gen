    "intro": "Aspidium sancti-gabrielis, commonly known as the Saint Gabriel's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Aspidium sancti-gabrielis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
