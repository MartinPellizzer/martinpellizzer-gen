    "intro": "Albizia adianthifolia var. intermedia, commonly known as the slender albizia, is a leguminous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It features bipinnate leaves with small, delicate leaflets that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, which are often fragrant. Its seeds are enclosed in flat, pod-like fruits that split open when mature. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
