    "intro": "Arenaria cucubaloides var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It typically features succulent, fleshy leaves that are smooth and glabrous, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, often blooming in early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky outcrops. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
