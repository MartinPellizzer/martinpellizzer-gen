    "intro": "Asparagus setaceus, commonly known as the evergreen asparagus or lace asparagus, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It features feathery, needle-like leaves that are typically bright green and arranged in a dense, compact form. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value comes from its unique foliage and ability to maintain its appearance year-round."
