    "intro": "Alchemilla persica, commonly known as Persian lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of rounded, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. Alchemilla persica thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and woodland settings."
