    "intro": "Anotis arnottiana, commonly known as the coastal daisy or coastal anotis, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and dunes. It is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate moderate drought conditions. Anotis arnottiana plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and provides habitat for native insects and birds."
