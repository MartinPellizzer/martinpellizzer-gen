    "intro": "Astragalus subbarbellatus, commonly known as the western milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow to reddish-pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions, and it plays a role in soil stabilization and nitrogen fixation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions."
