    "intro": "Agropyron repens var. glaucum, commonly known as the bluegrass meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green foliage and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas such as grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and have a slight bluish tint, which contributes to its distinctive appearance. Agropyron repens var. glaucum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
