    "intro": "Allaeanthus luzonicus, commonly known as the Luzon orchid, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often near streams or in mountainous regions. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and the flowers exhibit a range of colors, including white, pink, and purple. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Allaeanthus luzonicus is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
