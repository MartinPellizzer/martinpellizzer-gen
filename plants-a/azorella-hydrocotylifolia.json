    "intro": "Azorella hydrocotylifolia, commonly known as the Chilean cushion plant, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its dense, low-growing rosette structure. It is native to the Andes Mountains of southern Chile and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a thick layer of white, woolly hairs, which help to insulate it from extreme temperatures. Its flowers are tiny and clustered in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Azorella hydrocotylifolia is also known for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
