    "intro": "Arabis albida var. elata, commonly known as the alpine rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 centimeters. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
