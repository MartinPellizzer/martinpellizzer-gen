    "intro": "Alsinella procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate alsinella, is a low-growing annual herb native to southern Africa. It typically forms dense mats of slender, branching stems that lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. Alsinella procumbens is often found in sandy or rocky soils in dry, open habitats."
