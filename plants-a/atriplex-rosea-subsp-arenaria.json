    "intro": "Atriplex rosea subsp. arenaria, commonly known as sandmat, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a white, powdery coating called a bloom, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its robust root system allows it to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in harsh environments."
