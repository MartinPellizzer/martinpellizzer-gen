It is a shrub characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats within dense forest understories. Its floral structure is adapted for pollination by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.",
