    "intro": "Agropyron lenense, commonly known as the Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Agropyron lenense is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cold temperatures. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in arid and semi-arid regions."
