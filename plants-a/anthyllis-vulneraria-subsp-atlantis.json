    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria subsp. atlantis, commonly known as the Atlantis clover, is a rare and specialized plant species found in specific alpine and coastal habitats. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of the legume family Fabaceae. The subspecies is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its distribution is limited to a few regions, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its restricted range and habitat requirements, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance."
