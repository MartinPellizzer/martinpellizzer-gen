    "intro": "Asplenium filaroides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, linear leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium filaroides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
