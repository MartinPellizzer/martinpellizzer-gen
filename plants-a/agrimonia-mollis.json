    "intro": "Agrimonia mollis, commonly known as sweet agrimony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branched stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are palmately lobed with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by reddish-brown, spherical fruits. Agrimonia mollis is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it has a long history of use in traditional herbal medicine. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for both ecological and historical studies."
