It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom at night. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without being parasitic. Its flowers have a unique structure with long, slender petals and a prominent, spurred lip, which is adapted for pollination by moths. Angraecum imerinense is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts due to its beauty and rarity."
