    "intro": "Anthurium oblitum, commonly known as the ghost anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the understory of humid forests in Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are usually dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces vibrant, spadix-shaped inflorescences surrounded by a colorful spathe, typically in shades of red or orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Anthurium oblitum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and unique floral structure."
