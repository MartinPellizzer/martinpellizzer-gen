    "intro": "Azorella echegarayi, commonly known as the Andean haircap, is a perennial cushion plant native to the high Andes of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae and is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosettes of dark green, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters at the center of the rosette. Azorella echegarayi is adapted to harsh, alpine conditions, thriving in cold, dry environments with poor soil. Its unique morphology allows it to retain moisture and withstand strong winds and intense sunlight."
