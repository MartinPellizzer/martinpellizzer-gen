    "intro": "Abies sachalinensis var. mayriana, commonly known as the Mayrian fir, is a rare variant of the sachalin fir native to the Korean Peninsula. It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces small, cylindrical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.",

It thrives in cool, humid climates with well-drained soils. The plant is typically found in forested areas at higher elevations. Its distribution is limited to specific geographic regions within Japan and the Russian island of Sakhalin.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies sachalinensis var. mayriana was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its attractive conical shape and slow growth rate. It is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic value and ability to thrive in cooler climates. This variant is particularly valued for its dense foliage and unique appearance, making it a popular choice for specimen planting. However, it is important to note that it is not commonly found in the wild and is mostly grown in controlled environments. Its introduction has been limited to specific regions where it can be maintained under suitable conditions."
