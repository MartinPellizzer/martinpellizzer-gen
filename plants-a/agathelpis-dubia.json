    "intro": "Agathelpis dubia, commonly known as the rare ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its small, clustered roots help it anchor to tree bark while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Due to its elusive nature and habitat specificity, Agathelpis dubia is considered a critically endangered species, making it a subject of significant botanical interest and conservation efforts."
