    "intro": "Athyrium banahaoense, commonly known as the Bana Ha'o fern, is a species of fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, aiding in soil stabilization. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds."
