    "intro": "Arnica alpina var. ungavensis, commonly known as the Ungava arnica, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It typically grows in open, rocky, or sandy soils in alpine and tundra environments. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow-orange flowers with prominent yellow centers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in cold climates and low-nutrient soils. The species is also known for its medicinal properties, though its use is limited due to its toxicity."
