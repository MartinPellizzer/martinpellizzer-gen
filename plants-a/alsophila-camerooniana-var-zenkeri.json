    "intro": "Alsophila camerooniana var. zenkeri, commonly known as the Cameroon tree fern, is a species native to the tropical rainforests of Central and West Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is known for its slow growth and longevity. Its rhizome system allows it to anchor firmly in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in shaded, humid environments. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
