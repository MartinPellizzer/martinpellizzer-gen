It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features slender, wiry stems and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pale pink. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
