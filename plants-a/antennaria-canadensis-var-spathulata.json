    "intro": "Antennaria canadensis var. spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaved mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It features a mat-forming habit with small, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny white or pink flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Its botanical structure supports its role as a ground cover and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
