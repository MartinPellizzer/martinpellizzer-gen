    "intro": "Atriplex andina, commonly known as Andean saltbush, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to arid and saline environments. The plant has a robust root system that helps it survive in poor soils and extreme temperatures. Its small greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, hard seeds. Atriplex andina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for livestock in its native habitat."
