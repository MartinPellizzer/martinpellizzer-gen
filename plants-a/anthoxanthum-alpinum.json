    "intro": "Anthoxanthum alpinum, commonly known as alpine yellow grass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and bright yellow inflorescences that distinguish it from other grasses. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. Anthoxanthum alpinum plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra regions."
