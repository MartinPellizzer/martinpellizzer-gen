    "intro": "Antimima verruculosa, commonly known as the roughleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and grasslands. Its leaves are often arranged in a basal rosette, and the flowers are surrounded by a pappus of bristles that aid in seed dispersal. Antimima verruculosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional medicinal uses."
