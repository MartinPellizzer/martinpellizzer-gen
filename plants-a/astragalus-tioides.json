It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are compound, with oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain small, round seeds. Astragalus tioides plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinators."
