    "intro": "Apseudes, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers that resemble those of the true dandelion. The plants are typically found in temperate regions and are often regarded as weeds in agricultural settings. Apseudes species are perennial herbs that thrive in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through vegetative reproduction. Their botanical features make them adaptable to various environmental conditions, though they are generally not cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
