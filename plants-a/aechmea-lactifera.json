    "intro": "Aechmea lactifera, commonly known as the milk bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaf structure that forms a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, spiky inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, adding visual interest to its appearance. Its leaves are usually broad and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive, almost silvery appearance. Aechmea lactifera thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal."
