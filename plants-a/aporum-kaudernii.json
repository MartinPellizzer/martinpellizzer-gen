    "intro": "Aporum kaudernii, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant's showy white flowers bloom in the early morning and emit a strong fragrance to attract pollinators. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the muddy bottom of its habitat while absorbing nutrients from the water. Aporum kaudernii plays a vital role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for various aquatic species."
