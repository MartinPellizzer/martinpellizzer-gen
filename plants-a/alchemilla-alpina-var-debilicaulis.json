    "intro": "Alchemilla alpina var. debilicaulis, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, silver-gray foliage with a soft, velvety texture, which helps it retain moisture in its alpine habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands at high elevations. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cold, harsh environments."
