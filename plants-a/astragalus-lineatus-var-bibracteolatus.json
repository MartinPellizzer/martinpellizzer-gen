    "intro": "Astragalus lineatus var. bibracteolatus, commonly known as the two-bract legume, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellow flowers clustered in racemes. The plant produces pods that contain several elliptical seeds, and its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or steppe environments. This variety is distinguished by its unique two-bract structures at the base of the flower cluster, which contribute to its taxonomic classification."
