    "intro": "Astragalus scrobiculatus, commonly known as the wrinkled milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with a distinctive, wrinkled texture and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats. Astragalus scrobiculatus is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
