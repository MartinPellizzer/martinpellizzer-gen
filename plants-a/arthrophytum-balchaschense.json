It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is often found growing on rocky slopes and in dry, sandy soils. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
