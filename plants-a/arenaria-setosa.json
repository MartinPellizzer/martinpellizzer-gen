    "intro": "Arenaria setosa, commonly known as the silky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy, leafy stems and small, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in rocky or coastal environments. Arenaria setosa is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in harsh climates."
