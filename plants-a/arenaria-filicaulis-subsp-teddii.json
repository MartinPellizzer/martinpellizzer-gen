    "intro": "Arenaria filicaulis subsp. teddii, commonly known as the Teddii sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for rocky or sandy habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
