    "intro": "Althaea microcarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited marshmallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils near water bodies, thriving in wetland or marshy environments. The plant features showy, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its characteristic soft texture. Althaea microcarpa is known for its mucilaginous roots, which have been used historically in traditional medicine."
