    "intro": "Asplenium haughtonii, commonly known as the Haughton's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, spore-producing structures called sori. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found growing on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Asplenium haughtonii is notable for its adaptability and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
