    "intro": "Astragalus miser var. oblongifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, oblong leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions. This variety is often found in sagebrush steppe and other xeric ecosystems."
