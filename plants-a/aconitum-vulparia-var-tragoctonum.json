    "intro": "Aconitum vulparia var. tragoctonum, commonly known as the alpine aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in a raceme at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed divisions, and are typically hairy. The plant contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling.",
