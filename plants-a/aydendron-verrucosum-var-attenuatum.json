The leaves are usually small, elliptical, and have a leathery texture, while the flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences. This variant is adapted to specific ecological niches, often found in rocky or disturbed soils. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for certain habitats and its potential value in ecological and medicinal research."
