    "intro": "Arctostaphylos tomentosa subsp. bracteosa, commonly known as the bracteosa madrone, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its thick, woolly leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, leathery berries that are edible for some wildlife but generally unpalatable to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. The subspecies is distinguished by its bract-like structures beneath the flowers, which are a key identifying feature."
