    "intro": "Ardisia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly evergreen, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in shaded gardens."
