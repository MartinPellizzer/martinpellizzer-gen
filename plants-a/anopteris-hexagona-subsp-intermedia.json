    "intro": "Anopteris hexagona subsp. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate cliffbracken, is a fern native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its erect, sword-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm long. The fronds are bipinnate, with small, oval-shaped pinnae that are arranged in a distinctive, somewhat triangular pattern. This subspecies thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and cliff faces. Its adaptability to salty air and strong winds makes it a resilient plant in harsh maritime environments."
