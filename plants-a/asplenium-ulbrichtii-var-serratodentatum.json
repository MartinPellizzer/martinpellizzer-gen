    "intro": "Asplenium ulbrichtii var. serratodentatum, commonly known as the serrated tooth fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, serrated fronds that give it a distinctive, delicate appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing year-round foliage in its natural habitat."
