    "intro": "Androrchis olbiensis, commonly known as the Olbiense Orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is a terrestrial orchid with a short, hairy stem and a single, showy flower that typically blooms in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves and produces a distinctive, fragrant orchid flower with a yellow lip. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the cool, humid climates of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
