    "intro": "Athyrium epirachis, commonly known as the broad-leafed lady fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, compound fronds that are divided into broad, lance-shaped pinnae. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Athyrium epirachis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, fern-like foliage."
