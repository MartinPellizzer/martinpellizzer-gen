This species is found in the southeastern region of Brazil, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. It is commonly associated with moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. The plant is part of the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its distinctive foliage. Its native range is limited to this specific geographic area within Brazil.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha peckoltii was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It is commonly found in the southeastern region, particularly in states like Florida and Texas, where it thrives in warm, humid climates. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has become an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant is often spread through discarded garden waste or by bird-dispersed seeds. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it poses a challenge for land managers seeking to control its spread."
