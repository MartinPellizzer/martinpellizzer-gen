    "intro": "Acetosella polyphylla, commonly known as the mountain sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of pink or white flowers. The plant typically thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its leaves are edible and have a sour taste, similar to that of sorrel, and it is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies. Acetosella polyphylla plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky environments and supports local pollinator populations.",
