    "intro": "Artemisia maritima var. penduliflora, commonly known as coastal wormwood, is a variant of the coastal sagebrush found in coastal regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with silver-gray, aromatic foliage that is drought-tolerant and adapted to sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are often clustered at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are finely divided and have a distinctive, strong medicinal scent. This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
