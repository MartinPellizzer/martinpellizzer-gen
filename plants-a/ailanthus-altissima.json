    "intro": "Ailanthus altissima, commonly known as the tree of heaven, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged with 12 to 30 small, ovate leaflets. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is highly adaptable, thriving in a variety of soil types and environmental conditions. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is often considered a problematic species in non-native regions."
