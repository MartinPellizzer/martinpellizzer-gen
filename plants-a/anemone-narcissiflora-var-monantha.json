    "intro": "Anemone narcissiflora var. monantha, commonly known as the single-flowered anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, with a prominent yellow center. The plant has basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces a cluster of small, greenish flowers that develop into seed heads. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. This variety is distinguished by its single, large bloom per stem, setting it apart from other anemone species."
