    "intro": "Arum alpinum subsp. pyrenaeum, commonly known as the Pyrenean arum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It features a short, rhizomatous stem with large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces an inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe, which is characteristic of the Araceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in montane forests and alpine meadows. The species is notable for its striking appearance and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
