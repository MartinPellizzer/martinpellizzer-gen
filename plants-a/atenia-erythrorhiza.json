    "intro": "Atenia erythrorhiza, commonly known as the red-rooted atenia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its deep red roots and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
