    "intro": "Astrochlaena engleriana, commonly known as the Engler's star-moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a cryptogamic plant characterized by its small, leafy structure and lack of true roots, stems, and flowers. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually arranged in a rosette pattern and are covered with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Astrochlaena engleriana plays a role in soil stabilization and contributes to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
