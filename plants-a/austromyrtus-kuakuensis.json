    "intro": "Austromyrtus kuakuensis, commonly known as the Kaukuan myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the humid rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family, which includes eucalyptus and tea trees, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. It produces white or pale pink flowers followed by small, woody fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
