    "intro": "Argyrolobium rupestre, commonly known as the silver globemallow, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features hairy, silver-gray leaves that are adapted to arid environments, reflecting sunlight to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers with five petals, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
