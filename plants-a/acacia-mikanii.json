    "intro": "Acacia mikanii, commonly known as the Japanese acacia, is a flowering plant native to Japan and parts of eastern Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in compact clusters, which are followed by flat, bean-like pods. Acacia mikanii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing properties, which can improve soil fertility.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia mikanii is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in lowland areas with well-drained soils. This species thrives in open habitats, including grasslands, shrublands, and coastal areas. It is also occasionally found in parts of India and Indonesia. Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to other regions outside its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia mikanii was mainly introduced to New Zealand, where it was initially planted for ornamental purposes and as a potential source of timber. It has since become naturalized and is now found growing in various habitats, including coastal dunes and disturbed soils. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in a wide range of conditions have led to its spread beyond its original introduction sites. It is considered an environmental weed in some areas due to its competitive nature and impact on native vegetation. Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and minimize its ecological impact."
