The plant produces vibrant clusters of four-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking a resilient, colorful ground cover."
