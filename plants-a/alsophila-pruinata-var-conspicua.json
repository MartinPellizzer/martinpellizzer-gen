    "intro": "Alsophila pruinata var. conspicua, commonly known as the silver fern, is a variant of the slender tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, glossy, silver-green fronds that give it a striking appearance. The plant has a tall, unbranched trunk covered in a mass of old, dead fronds that provide a unique texture. Its fronds are pinnate, with a delicate, feathery structure that contributes to its ornamental value. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
