It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically light green in color. This plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats. Asplenium paleaceum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to enhance the aesthetic of shaded garden spaces."
