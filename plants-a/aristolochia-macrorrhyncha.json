    "intro": "Aristolochia macrorrhyncha, commonly known as the large-flowered Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and emits a strong, often unpleasant odor to attract its pollinators. It is a climbing vine that can grow up to several meters in length. The flowers are primarily pollinated by flies, which are attracted by the plant's scent and appearance."
