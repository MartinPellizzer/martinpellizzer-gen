    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha coryloides is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often seen growing in forest understories or near water sources. It is also native to parts of India and Sri Lanka, where it is adapted to similar environmental conditions. Acalypha coryloides is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha coryloides was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It is commonly found in areas with warm climates, including parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and the Caribbean. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative means have led to its establishment in some non-native environments. However, it is generally not considered invasive in most regions where it is introduced."
