    "intro": "Alchemilla pectinata, commonly known as the velvetleaf lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of soft, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that give it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in panicles during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Alchemilla pectinata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and its ability to tolerate wet conditions."
