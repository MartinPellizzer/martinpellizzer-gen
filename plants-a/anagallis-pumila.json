It features small, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of five-petaled, pinkish-white flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Anagallis pumila is a member of the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, creeping growth habit."
