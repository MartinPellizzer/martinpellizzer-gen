    "intro": "Arundarbor tenuis, commonly known as the slender willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to temperate regions. It features slender, branching stems that often trail or climb, with finely toothed, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological stability and wildlife habitat."
