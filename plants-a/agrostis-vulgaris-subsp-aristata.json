    "intro": "Agrostis vulgaris subsp. aristata, commonly known as the bentgrass or common bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its dense growth habit and is often used in turfgrass cultivation. This subspecies is distinguished by its slightly longer and more rigid leaves compared to other members of the Agrostis genus."
