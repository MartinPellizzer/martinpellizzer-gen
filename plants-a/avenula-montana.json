    "intro": "Avenula montana, commonly known as mountain oat, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense, low-growing clumps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Avenula montana is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor soil conditions. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
