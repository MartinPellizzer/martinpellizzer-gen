    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon anderssonianum is primarily native to the island of Madagascar. It is found in various habitats across the island, including dry forests and rocky areas. This plant is adapted to the unique climate and soil conditions of Madagascar. It is part of the Malvaceae family, which includes other economically important plants. Its native distribution is restricted to Madagascar, where it grows in specific ecological niches.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon anderssonianum was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers and its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. It is commonly used in garden settings for its aesthetic value and its relatively low maintenance requirements. This plant is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions where it can grow as a shrub or small tree. Its introduction has led to its establishment in some non-native areas, where it may pose ecological risks if not managed properly. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential invasiveness."
