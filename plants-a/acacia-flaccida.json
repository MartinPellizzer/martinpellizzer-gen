    "intro": "Acacia flaccida, commonly known as the weeping acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its drooping, feathery foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that perform the function of true leaves. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. Acacia flaccida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia flaccida is primarily native to northern Australia, including regions of Queensland, the Northern Territory, and Western Australia. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in open woodlands and rocky outcrops. This species is well adapted to drought conditions and can tolerate poor soil quality. It is commonly seen in coastal and inland areas where the climate is hot and dry. Acacia flaccida plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia flaccida was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or rocky soils, particularly in regions with a Mediterranean climate. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or inland dunes. This plant is commonly introduced as an ornamental due to its attractive foliage and ability to withstand drought conditions. It has also been used in reclamation projects to stabilize soils in degraded landscapes. However, its introduction has sometimes led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain environments."
