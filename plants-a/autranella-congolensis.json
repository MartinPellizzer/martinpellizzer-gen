    "intro": "Autranella congolensis, commonly known as the Congo starwood, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and West Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, and its woody, shrub-like structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense forest canopies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within its family."
