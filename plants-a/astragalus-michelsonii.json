    "intro": "Astragalus michelsonii, commonly known as the Michelson milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of multiple narrow leaflets, and it has a deep taproot system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Astragalus michelsonii is part of the legume family and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria."
