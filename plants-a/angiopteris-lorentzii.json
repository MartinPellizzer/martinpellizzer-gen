    "intro": "Angiopteris lorentzii, commonly known as the Lorentz's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, intricate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which helps attract nocturnal pollinators. This unique feature makes it a subject of interest in both botanical research and ecological studies."
