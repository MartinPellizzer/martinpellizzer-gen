    "intro": "Arenaria connata, commonly known as the coastal sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in dune environments and along shorelines. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are typically narrow and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. Arenaria connata plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion."
