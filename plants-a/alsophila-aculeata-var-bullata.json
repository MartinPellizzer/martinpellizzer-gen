    "intro": "Alsophila aculeata var. bullata, commonly known as the bullate tree fern, is a species native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia. It is a tall, upright fern characterized by its large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that helps it anchor firmly in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Cyatheaceae family. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in tropical gardens for its lush, tropical appearance."
