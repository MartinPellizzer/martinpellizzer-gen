    "intro": "Artemisia pendula, commonly known as hanging wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, drooping stems and small, gray-green, aromatic leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Artemisia pendula thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Its essential oils contain compounds like thujone, which have been historically used in herbal medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
