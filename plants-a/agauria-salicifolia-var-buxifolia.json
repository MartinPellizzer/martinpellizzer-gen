    "intro": "Agauria salicifolia var. buxifolia, commonly known as the boxleaf willow-leaf agauria, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the southern United States. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a foundation plant. Its unique foliage and hardy nature make it an attractive addition to coastal and sandy landscapes."
