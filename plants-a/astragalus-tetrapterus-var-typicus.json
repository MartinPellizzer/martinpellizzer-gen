    "intro": "Astragalus tetrapterus var. typicus, commonly known as the four-winged milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish to greenish flowers clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces distinctive, four-winged pods that are typical of the genus Astragalus, which is part of the legume family, Fabaceae. It has adapted to harsh environments through deep root systems and drought tolerance. This species is often found in sandy soils and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
