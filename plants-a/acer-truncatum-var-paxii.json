It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its botanical features make it a notable species in both ecological and ornamental contexts.",
