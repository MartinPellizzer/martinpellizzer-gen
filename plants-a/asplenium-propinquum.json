    "intro": "Asplenium propinquum, commonly known as the common maidenhair fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Korean Peninsula. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that are often described as resembling the feathers of a bird, hence its common name. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium propinquum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
