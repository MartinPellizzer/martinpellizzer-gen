    "intro": "Arabidopsis yadungensis, commonly known as the Yadungensis thale, is a small flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, particularly in Nepal and northern India. This species is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, simple leaves. The flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with four petals arranged in a cross shape, typical of the Brassicaceae family. It is a model organism for studying plant genetics and evolution due to its short life cycle and ease of cultivation."
