    "intro": "Anthemis, commonly known as ragwort, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their yellow or orange flowers, which are typically arranged in composite heads. Anthemis species are often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils. Many species have aromatic leaves and are sometimes used in herbal medicine. However, some species, like Great Ragwort, are considered invasive and can be toxic to livestock."
