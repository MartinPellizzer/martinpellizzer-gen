    "intro": "Austrobuxus depauperatus, commonly known as the sparse-leaved boxwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
