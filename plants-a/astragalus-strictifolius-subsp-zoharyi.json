    "intro": "Astragalus strictifolius subsp. zoharyi, commonly known as Zohary's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the Middle East and parts of the Mediterranean. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its upright stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with numerous leaflets, and its flowers are usually pink or purple in color. It is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
