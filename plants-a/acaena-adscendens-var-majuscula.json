It is found in the northern and central regions of the country, including the North Island and parts of the South Island. This plant typically grows in coastal and lowland areas, often in sandy or gravelly soils. It is commonly associated with coastal dunes and shrublands. The species is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena adscendens var. majuscula was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. This plant has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. It is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in disturbed soils. Its introduction has led to it becoming a weed in some native ecosystems."
