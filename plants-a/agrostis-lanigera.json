It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and dense, mat-like growth habit, often forming a thick turf. The plant has hairy nodes and leaves, which give it its common name, and it typically grows in moist, well-drained soils. Agrostis lanigera is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass management."
