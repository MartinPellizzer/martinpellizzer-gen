    "intro": "Adiantum pedatum var. originarium, commonly known as the northern maidenhair fern, is a variant of the delicate maidenhair fern native to North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new growth from the base, allowing it to spread gradually. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light.",
