    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelmoschus cucurbitaceus is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, particularly India, China, and Southeast Asia. It thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil and ample sunlight. This plant is commonly found in areas with a monsoonal climate, where it grows as an annual herb. It is often cultivated for its edible fruits, which are used in various culinary traditions. Its native range also extends to parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus cucurbitaceus was mainly introduced to new agricultural regions to expand crop diversity and improve food security. It is valued for its high nutritional content, including vitamins and minerals, making it a valuable addition to diets in developing countries. The plant's adaptability to various soil types and climates has contributed to its successful introduction in tropical and subtropical areas. Its introduction has also supported local farming communities by providing a resilient crop with potential economic benefits. However, its spread has raised concerns about potential competition with native species in some ecosystems."
