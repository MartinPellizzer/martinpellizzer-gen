    "intro": "Artemisia lithophila, commonly known as desert sand sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Artemisia lithophila is often found growing on rocky soils and in sandy areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil and preventing erosion. Its aromatic oils also contribute to its use in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
