    "intro": "Armeria maritima var. colorata, commonly known as the colored thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial with dense clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has linear, gray-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils. It is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ability to withstand salt spray. The variety 'colorata' is distinguished by its more vibrant and showy flower color compared to the typical white flowers of the species."
