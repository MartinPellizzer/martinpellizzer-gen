    "intro": "Alchemilla ventiana, commonly known as the rock alchemilla, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant features basal leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer. Alchemilla ventiana thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its common name reflects its historical use in alchemical practices, though it is more valued today for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
