    "intro": "Astragalus pseudodianthus, commonly known as the western milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions and is often found in open grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Astragalus pseudodianthus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
