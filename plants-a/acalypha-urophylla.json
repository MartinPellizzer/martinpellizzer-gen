    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha urophylla is primarily native to Madagascar. It is found in the eastern part of the island, particularly in humid lowland and montane rainforests. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often associated with secondary growth areas. It is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of Madagascar. Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic plant species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha urophylla was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was first recorded in Hawaii in the early 20th century and has since spread to other tropical regions. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Its rapid growth and ability to reproduce vegetatively have contributed to its spread. However, it is considered a potential weed in some areas, raising concerns about its ecological impact."
