    "intro": "Acer creticum, commonly known as the Cretan maple, is a deciduous tree native to the island of Crete in Greece. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically lobed and have a striking reddish or bronze coloration during the autumn season. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, Acer creticum is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer creticum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe, particularly in the Carpathian Basin. It is found in countries such as Hungary, Romania, and parts of Serbia. This species thrives in rocky and forested areas at elevations ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats with well-drained soils and moderate climates. Due to its restricted range, Acer creticum is considered a rare and endemic plant in its native region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer creticum was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often found in forested regions. It is commonly distributed in parts of Europe, particularly in the Mediterranean region, as well as in some parts of Asia. This plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found growing along stream banks or in woodland understories. Its introduction has been largely due to its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types. However, it is not widely cultivated outside its native range."
