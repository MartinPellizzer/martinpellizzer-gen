    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa var. oxyacanthifolia, commonly known as the sticky alder, is a variant of the European alder characterized by its unique botanical features. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, temperate regions. The leaves are elliptical with a serrated margin and a glossy upper surface, while the bark is smooth and often reddish-brown. It produces small, clustered flowers followed by woody fruits that contain seeds. This plant is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in nitrogen fixation through symbiotic relationships with Frankia bacteria."
