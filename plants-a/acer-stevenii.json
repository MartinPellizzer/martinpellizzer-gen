    "intro": "Acer stevenii, commonly known as Steven's maple, is a species of deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable addition to botanical collections.",
