    "intro": "Alyssum fallacinum, commonly known as the desert alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Alyssum fallacinum is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
