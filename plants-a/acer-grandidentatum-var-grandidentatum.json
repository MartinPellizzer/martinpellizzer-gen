    "intro": "Acer grandidentatum var. grandidentatum, commonly known as the Mexican maple, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which are typically bright green on the upper surface and lighter in color on the underside. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. The species is also valued for its role in local ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",
