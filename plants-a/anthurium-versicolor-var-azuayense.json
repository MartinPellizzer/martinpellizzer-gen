    "intro": "Anthurium versicolor var. azuayense, commonly known as the Azuay Anthurium, is a striking tropical plant native to the Andean region of Ecuador. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful spathe that can range from deep reds to purples and yellows, depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, green spadices that house the actual flowers, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in humid, well-draining soil and requires indirect light to flourish. This variety is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
