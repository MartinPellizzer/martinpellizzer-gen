    "intro": "Aphanes occidentalis, commonly known as western sandspur, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, spiny fruits and hairy, linear leaves that are adapted to arid environments. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dry fields. Its flowers are small and white, appearing in clusters, and it blooms from spring to early summer. Aphanes occidentalis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and animals."
