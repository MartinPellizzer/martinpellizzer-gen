    "intro": "Actinobole condensatum, commonly known as the condensed actinobole, is a rare and unique plant species found in specific alpine environments. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. The plant is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth form and small, white to pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a faint, spicy scent when crushed. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",
