    "intro": "Agrostis lenta, commonly known as silky bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features fine, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, spikelet-based flowers are usually inconspicuous and appear in late summer. Silky bentgrass is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
