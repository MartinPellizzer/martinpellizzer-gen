    "intro": "Anthurium affine, commonly known as the red anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a reddish or maroon tint. The plant produces vibrant red spathes that enclose its spadix, which is a unique floral structure typical of the Araceae family. Anthurium affine thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Its foliage and inflorescence make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental purposes."
