    "intro": "Asplenium mossambicense, commonly known as the African shield fern, is a terrestrial fern native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of moss-like growth. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
