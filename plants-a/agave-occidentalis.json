    "intro": "Agave occidentalis, commonly known as the western agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears clusters of white or yellow flowers, which are pollinated by insects and bats. It is adapted to arid environments and can store water in its leaves and stem. Agave occidentalis is often used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
