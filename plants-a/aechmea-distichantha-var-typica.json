    "intro": "Aechmea distichantha var. typica, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It features a rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular as a decorative plant due to its ornamental foliage and long-lasting blooms."
