    "intro": "Aegiphila vitelliniflora, commonly known as the golden-flowered aegiphila, is a species of flowering plant in the family Lamiaceae. It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and South Africa. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. It typically grows as a shrub or subshrub, often with a creeping habit. Due to its resilience to drought and its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in dry gardens and rockeries."
