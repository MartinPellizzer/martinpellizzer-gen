    "intro": "Arabis ottonis-schulzii, commonly known as the rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. It has basal leaves that are linear to lanceolate and produces seed pods that split open to release its tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
