    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha amentacea var. grandis is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical rainforests and moist lowland areas. This plant thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and partial to full sunlight. It is often seen growing along riverbanks and in secondary forests. Its distribution is also reported in parts of India and the Pacific Islands.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha amentacea var. grandis was mainly introduced to urban and disturbed areas due to its adaptability and ornamental value. It is commonly found in roadside embankments, waste areas, and along stream banks. The plant thrives in moist to wet conditions and can tolerate poor soil quality. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes contribute to its invasive potential in non-native regions. It is considered a weed in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation."
