    "intro": "Agropyron pungens var. acadiense, commonly known as the Acadian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, blue-green blades that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, each bearing small, awned flowers that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woods, meadows, and along roadsides. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
