    "intro": "Astrotricha crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved starwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of large, heart-shaped leaves and its showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is native to temperate regions of Asia and is often found in meadows and rocky habitats. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its native environment. Astrotricha crassifolia is typically short-lived, with a lifespan of one to two years."
