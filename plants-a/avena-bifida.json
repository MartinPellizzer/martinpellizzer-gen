    "intro": "Avena bifida, commonly known as the split oatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It has slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly folded. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are encased in a protective hull, which aids in dispersal by wind or water. Avena bifida is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open woodlands."
