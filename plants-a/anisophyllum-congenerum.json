    "intro": "Anisophyllum congenerum, commonly known as the dwarf fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant has delicate, feathery fronds that are usually less than a foot in length. Its rhizomes are short and often form dense clusters, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative reproduction. Anisophyllum congenerum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, shady garden settings."
