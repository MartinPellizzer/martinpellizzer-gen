    "intro": "Anteriorchis fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant anteriorchis, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant blossoms that emit a sweet, spicy aroma, particularly in the evening. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a lush backdrop to its vibrant flowers. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with multiple stems that can reach up to two meters in height. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Anteriorchis fragrans is considered a threatened species in its native range."
