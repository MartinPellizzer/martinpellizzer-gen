    "intro": "Asplenium triphyllum var. herbaceum, commonly known as the three-leaf spleenwort, is a fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its trifoliate (three-lobed) leaves, which are often clustered at the base. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. The plant's herbaceous nature and delicate foliage make it a unique addition to woodland ecosystems."
