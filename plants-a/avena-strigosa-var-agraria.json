It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Avena strigosa var. agraria is an important forage crop and has historical significance in agricultural practices."
