It features compound leaves with a distinctive, feathery appearance, and its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in umbels. The plant produces berries that are edible for some animals but generally not considered safe for human consumption. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a notable species in both ornamental horticulture and ecological studies."
