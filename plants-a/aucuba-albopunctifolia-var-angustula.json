It features glossy, dark green leaves with distinctive white and yellow spots, giving it a striking visual appeal. The plant has a compact growth habit and produces small, inconspicuous yellow-green flowers in the spring. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for shaded garden spaces. Due to its rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialty nurseries."
