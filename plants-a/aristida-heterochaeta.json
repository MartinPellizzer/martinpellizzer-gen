    "intro": "Aristida heterochaeta, commonly known as the hairy dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southern United States. It features slender, erect stems that grow up to 60 centimeters tall, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. Due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements, it is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
