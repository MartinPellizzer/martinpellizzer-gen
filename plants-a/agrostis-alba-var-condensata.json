It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and dense, compact growth habit, which makes it well-suited for ornamental landscaping. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pale green to reddish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, often found in meadows and grassy areas. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both ecological and aesthetic purposes in gardens and conservation areas."
