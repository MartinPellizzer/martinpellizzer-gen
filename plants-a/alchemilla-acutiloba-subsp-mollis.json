    "intro": "Alchemilla acutiloba subsp. mollis, commonly known as softleaf alpine lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on tall, slender stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and shady borders."
