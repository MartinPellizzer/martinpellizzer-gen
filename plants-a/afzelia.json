    "intro": "Afzelia, commonly known as African ironwood, is a genus of tropical trees belonging to the family Fabaceae. These plants are characterized by their dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its durability and strength. Afzelia species typically have compound leaves and produce small, often clustered flowers. They are native to Africa, particularly in regions with tropical and subtropical climates. The genus includes several species, such as Afzelia africana and Afzelia bipindensis, which are important in both ecological and economic contexts."
