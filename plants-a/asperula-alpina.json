    "intro": "Asperula alpina, commonly known as the alpine sweet pepper or alpine shrub vetch, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and features small, dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, bean-like fruits. Asperula alpina thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
