    "intro": "Asplenium obtusatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Asia and Australia. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that often have a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread vegetatively, while its spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of its leaves. Asplenium obtusatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
