    "intro": "Anagallis tsaratananae, commonly known as the Tsaratanana morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to white. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, soft hair, while its stems are slender and often trailing. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
