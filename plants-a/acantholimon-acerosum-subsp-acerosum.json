    "intro": "Acantholimon acerosum subsp. acerosum, commonly known as the hard-leaved acantholimon, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its rigid, spiny stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in terminal clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions.",

This plant is typically found in regions with dry, rocky, or semi-arid habitats. It is commonly associated with mountainous areas and coastal zones in its native range. The subspecies is well adapted to the climate and soil conditions of these regions. Its distribution reflects its preference for temperate and subtropical environments.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon acerosum subsp. acerosum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal or inland dunes. It thrives in full sun and is commonly found in regions with a Mediterranean climate. This subspecies is typically associated with disturbed sites such as roadsides, agricultural fields, and sandy coastal areas. It is known for its drought tolerance and ability to colonize open, sunny habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it has become a common weed in areas where it has been introduced."
