    "intro": "Amblyorhinum grandiflorum, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Its showy, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Amblyorhinum grandiflorum is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, with deep roots and a slow growth rate to conserve resources."
