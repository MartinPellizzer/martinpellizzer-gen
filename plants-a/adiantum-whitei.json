    "intro": "Adiantum whitei, commonly known as the White's maidenhair fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It features finely divided, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly glossy texture. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Adiantum whitei is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in controlled, humid conditions.",
