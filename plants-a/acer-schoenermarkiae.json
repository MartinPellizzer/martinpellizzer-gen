    "intro": "Acer schoenermarkiae, commonly known as the Sch\u00f6nermark's maple, is a rare and striking deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange foliage in the fall, which makes it a notable ornamental plant. The tree has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is highly valued in botanical gardens and conservation efforts.",
