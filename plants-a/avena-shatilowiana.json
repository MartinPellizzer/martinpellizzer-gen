    "intro": "Avena shatilowiana, commonly known as the Siberian oat, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subarctic environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental or for its potential ecological benefits."
