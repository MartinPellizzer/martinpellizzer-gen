    "intro": "Alphonsea, commonly known as the Indian almond tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Anacardiaceae. It comprises several species, many of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. The plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that often have five petals. The fruit is typically a drupe, containing a single seed, and the wood is sometimes used in traditional crafts. Alphonsea species are also valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological roles in their native habitats."
