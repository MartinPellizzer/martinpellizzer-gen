    "intro": "Aphelexis humilis, commonly known as the common sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, round fruits containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid gardens."
