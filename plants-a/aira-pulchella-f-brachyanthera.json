    "intro": "Aira pulchella f. brachyanthera, commonly known as the compact aira or dwarf aira, is a compact, tufted perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pale pink flowers in late summer. The foliage is typically dense and low-growing, making it suitable for ground cover in moist, well-drained soils. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in woodland areas. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form a dense, attractive mat."
