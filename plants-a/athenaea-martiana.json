    "intro": "Athenaea martiana, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep pink. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to cool, moist environments. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Athenaea martiana plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
