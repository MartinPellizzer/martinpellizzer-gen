    "intro": "Acer spicatum subsp. ukurunduense, commonly known as the Ukurundu maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Andes of South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and distinctive leaves that are often doubly serrated with a pale underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests at high altitudes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.",
