    "intro": "Astragalus gomboeformis var. oranensis, commonly known as the Oranese milkvetch, is a flowering plant species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry environments, with deep roots that help it access underground water sources. This variant is of particular interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
