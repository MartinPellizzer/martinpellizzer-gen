It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky outcrops.
