    "intro": "Agropyron intermedium var. selinense, commonly known as the desert wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to thrive in poor soils. This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in disturbed environments."
