    "intro": "Abutilon depauperatum, commonly known as the poor man's abutilon, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon depauperatum is primarily native to the Caribbean, specifically the islands of the Lesser Antilles. It is found in countries such as Saint Lucia, Martinique, and Grenada. This plant typically grows in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. It is commonly associated with sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny environments. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon depauperatum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, waste areas, and agricultural fields. It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is often found in the Mediterranean climate zones, including parts of California and southern Europe. It has been reported as an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds. Its distribution is largely influenced by human activity and environmental conditions that favor its establishment."
