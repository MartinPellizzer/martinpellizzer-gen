    "intro": "Acronia diazii, commonly known as the Sierra Madre acronia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Acronia diazii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists.",
