    "intro": "Aechmea mollis, commonly known as the velvet plant, is a bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The leaves are thick, leathery, and covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs, giving the plant its common name. It produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with vibrant red or orange flowers. This plant is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
