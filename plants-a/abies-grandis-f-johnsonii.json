    "intro": "Abies grandis f. johnsonii, commonly known as the Johnson's white fir, is a rare variant of the white fir species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. This subspecies is characterized by its dense, conical crown and pale blue-green needles that give it a striking appearance. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous regions, often at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.",

This subspecies is found in regions characterized by high elevation and cool, moist climates. It typically grows in mountainous areas with well-drained soils. The plant is commonly associated with subalpine and alpine ecosystems. Its distribution includes states such as Colorado, Wyoming, and Idaho, as well as provinces in Alberta and British Columbia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies grandis f. johnsonii was mainly introduced to specific regions in North America, particularly in the western United States and parts of Canada. This introduction was primarily for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and growth characteristics. It has been planted in various landscapes, including urban areas and private gardens, where it serves as a decorative evergreen. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems. Despite its popularity, it is not widely naturalized in the wild."
