    "intro": "Arachniodes coniifolia, commonly known as the Japanese spider fern, is a striking evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It features gracefully arching fronds that resemble spider legs, giving it its common name. The plant has a short, rhizomatous stem and produces spore-bearing clusters called sorus on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its foliage is typically dark green with a silvery sheen, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
