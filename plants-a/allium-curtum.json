    "intro": "Allium curtum, commonly known as the Armenian leek, is a perennial plant native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a cluster of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, garlic-like flavor, often used in traditional cuisines. Allium curtum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
