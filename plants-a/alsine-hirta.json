    "intro": "Alsine hirta, commonly known as hairy alsike, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 20 to 60 centimeters and has hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in small, oblong pods that split open to release the seeds. Alsine hirta is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
