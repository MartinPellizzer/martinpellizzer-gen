    "intro": "Aira polygama, commonly known as the common airgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its preference for wet environments. Aira polygama plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
