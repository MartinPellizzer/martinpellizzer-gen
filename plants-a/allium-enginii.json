    "intro": "Allium enginii, commonly known as the Engin's onion, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Allium genus. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white or pale purple flowers. Native to specific regions in Central Asia, this plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Its bulbous structure is similar to other alliums, but it possesses unique genetic markers that distinguish it from more common species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a subject of interest for botanical research and conservation efforts."
