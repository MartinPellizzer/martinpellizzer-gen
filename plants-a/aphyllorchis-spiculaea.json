It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption in poor soil conditions. The species is noted for its unique floral structure and is often found in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi."
