It is commonly found in the island's dry and humid regions, particularly in forested areas and along riverbanks. This variety is adapted to the tropical climate of Madagascar, where it thrives in warm and moist conditions. It is often seen growing in secondary forests and disturbed habitats. The plant is known for its distinctive red and black seed pods, which are used in traditional practices and as ornamental plants.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrus madagascariensis var. typicus was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its distinctive seed pods. It is commonly found in gardens and landscapes where it is valued for its visual appeal. The plant thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil and full sunlight. Despite its beauty, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care. Its introduction has sometimes led to its naturalization in certain areas outside its native range."
