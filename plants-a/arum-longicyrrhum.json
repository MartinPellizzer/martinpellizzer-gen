    "intro": "Arum longicyrrhum, commonly known as the long-hairy arum, is a tropical plant belonging to the Araceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and striking, spadix-bearing inflorescence. The plant produces a showy, often fragrant spathe that surrounds the central spadix, which contains the actual flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests. Arum longicyrrhum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
