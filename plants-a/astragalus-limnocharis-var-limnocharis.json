    "intro": "Astragalus limnocharis var. limnocharis, commonly known as the water milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant thrives in moist or aquatic environments, often found along the edges of ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are compound, with several pairs of leaflets that help it absorb sunlight efficiently in its wetland habitat. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing food for pollinators."
