    "intro": "Alsinula, commonly known as the \"garden spurge,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plants are characterized by their simple, opposite leaves and showy, capsule-like fruits. Alsinula species often have milky sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation. They are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value due to their attractive foliage and unique floral structures."
