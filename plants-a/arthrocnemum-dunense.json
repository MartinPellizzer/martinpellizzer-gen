    "intro": "Arthrocnemum dunense, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its leaves are often modified into spines, reducing water loss through transpiration. Arthrocnemum dunense plays a role in stabilizing dunes and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
