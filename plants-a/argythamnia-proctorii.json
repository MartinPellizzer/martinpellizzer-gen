    "intro": "Argythamnia proctorii, commonly known as the Proctor's argylea, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that are typically arranged in dense, spherical clusters. It has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. Argythamnia proctorii is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
