It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to rocky or gravelly habitats. This subspecies is often found in chaparral and woodland ecosystems, showing resilience to drought and fire."
