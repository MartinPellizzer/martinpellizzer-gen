It belongs to the Prunus genus and is characterized by its pink to white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces oval, yellowish fruits that are edible but have a bitter taste due to the presence of amygdalin. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine. The plant prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
