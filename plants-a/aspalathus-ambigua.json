    "intro": "Aspalathus ambigua, commonly known as the Greybush, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, grey-green leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is often found in rocky and sandy soils, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
