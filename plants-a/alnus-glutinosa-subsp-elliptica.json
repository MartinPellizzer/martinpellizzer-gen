    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa subsp. elliptica, commonly known as the sticky alder, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its elliptical leaves that are typically hairy on the underside, giving the plant a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are pollinated by wind. Its seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the berries, aiding in its spread. This subspecies is often found in moist, woodland areas and is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
