    "intro": "Achillea barrelieri subsp. oxyloba, commonly known as the Alpine yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and its clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has finely divided, aromatic leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions.",
