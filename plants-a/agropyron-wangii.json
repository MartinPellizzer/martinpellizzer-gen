    "intro": "Agropyron wangii, commonly known as the Tibetan wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet and neighboring areas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to cold and arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It is well-suited for soil stabilization and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature. Agropyron wangii is also valued for its potential nutritional properties and traditional uses in local communities."
