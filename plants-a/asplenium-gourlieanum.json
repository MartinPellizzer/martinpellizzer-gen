    "intro": "Asplenium gourlieanum, commonly known as the Gourlie's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sorangia, which are located on the underside of its fertile fronds. Asplenium gourlieanum is notable for its ability to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air, making it well adapted to its ecological niche."
