    "intro": "Andropogon canus, commonly known as silky grass or silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, silver-tomentose leaves that give it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, prairies, and along stream banks. Andropogon canus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
