    "intro": "Andrzeiowskia cardaminifolia, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette, and are often covered in fine hairs to protect against harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
