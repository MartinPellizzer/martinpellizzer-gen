    "intro": "Andryala varia var. subglabrata, commonly known as the smoothleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically features succulent, fleshy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the spring or early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is extensive, enabling it to anchor itself in loose, sandy soils and access moisture from deeper layers. This species is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and gravelly slopes, where it thrives in full sun."
