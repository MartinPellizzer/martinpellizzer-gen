    "intro": "Anemonastrum narcissiflorum subsp. villosissimum, commonly known as the woolly narcissus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, yellow, daffodil-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to cold climates. Its subspecies name, *villosissimum*, refers to its densely hairy stem and leaves."
