It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its flowering period occurs in the spring, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Andryala parviflora is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
