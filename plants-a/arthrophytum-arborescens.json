It is characterized by its dense, fleshy stems that form a compact, shrub-like structure. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to store water in arid environments. Arthrophytum arborescens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience."
