    "intro": "Arkezostis excisa, commonly known as the scarlet fringed orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its vibrant red petals adorned with intricate white fringes, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowering period occurs during the late spring to early summer, producing clusters of delicate, fragrant blooms. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
