    "intro": "Athyrium tenuifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved fern, is a species native to East Asia, including Japan, China, and Korea. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are finely divided, giving it a lacy appearance. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of ferns. Athyrium tenuifolium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various garden conditions."
