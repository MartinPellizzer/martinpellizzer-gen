    "intro": "Avena tatarica, commonly known as Tatarian oat, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous bracts. The plant produces minute, wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are enclosed in achenes with a single seed per fruit. Avena tatarica is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry meadows. It has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
