    "intro": "Adiantum sagittatum, commonly known as the arrowhead fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, bi-lobed fronds that resemble arrowheads, giving it its common name. The plant prefers moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or near streams. Its fronds are typically 15\u201330 cm long and are composed of small, finger-like segments called pinnae. Adiantum sagittatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.",
