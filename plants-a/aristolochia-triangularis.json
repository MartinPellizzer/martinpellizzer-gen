    "intro": "Aristolochia triangularis, commonly known as the triangular Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, heart-shaped flowers that are often maroon or purple in color. The plant belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is known for its unique floral structure that resembles a pipe, hence its common name. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while the stems are climbing or trailing. The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic and have been historically used in traditional medicine, though its use is now restricted due to health risks."
