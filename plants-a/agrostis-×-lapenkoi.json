    "intro": "Agrostis \u00d7 lapenkoi, commonly known as the Lapland bentgrass, is a hybrid grass species that occurs naturally in the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in nutrient-poor, acidic soils. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets. Agrostis \u00d7 lapenkoi plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment and is often found in tundra and alpine ecosystems."
