    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon haenkeanum is primarily native to Honduras, Mexico Central, Mexico Northeast, Mexico Northwest, Mexico Southeast, and Mexico Southwest. This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. The species is often associated with dry to semi-arid environments. Its natural range includes parts of Central and South America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon haenkeanum was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habits. The introduction occurred during the 19th century as part of the broader introduction of exotic species for horticultural purposes. It has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. However, it is not considered invasive and poses minimal ecological risk in its introduced range."
