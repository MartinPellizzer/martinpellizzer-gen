    "intro": "Alsine hispanica, commonly known as Spanish alsike, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, pink to violet flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the summer months. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Alsine hispanica is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
