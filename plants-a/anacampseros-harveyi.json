It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a desirable plant for both ornamental and ecological purposes."
