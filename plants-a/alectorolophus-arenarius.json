    "intro": "Alectorolophus arenarius, commonly known as the sand larkspur, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stem and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with low rainfall. Alectorolophus arenarius is often found in open plains and along coastal dunes, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes."
