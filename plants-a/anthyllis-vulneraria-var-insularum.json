It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers arranged in dense spikes. The plant thrives in rocky and coastal environments, demonstrating adaptability to harsh, nutrient-poor soils. Its morphology includes hairy stems and stipitate leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is part of the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing abilities through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules."
