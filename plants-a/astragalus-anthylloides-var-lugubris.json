    "intro": "Astragalus anthylloides var. lugubris, commonly known as the gloomy milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant has small, stipitate leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. It produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is considered a rare and endangered plant in some regions."
