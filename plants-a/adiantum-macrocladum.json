    "intro": "Adiantum macrocladum, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, deeply divided fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread across forest floors. Its fronds are typically green on the upper surface and silvery-white underneath, providing a striking visual contrast. Adiantum macrocladum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rich, organic soil.",
