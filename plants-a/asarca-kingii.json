It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its elegant appearance.
