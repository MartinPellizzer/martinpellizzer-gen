    "intro": "Alloplectus strigosus, commonly known as the hairy false nettle, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Its leaves and stems are covered in fine, sticky hairs, which help to deter herbivores. Alloplectus strigosus is part of the Onagraceae family, which includes other flowering plants with similar morphological characteristics."
