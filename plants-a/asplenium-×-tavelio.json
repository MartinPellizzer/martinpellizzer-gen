    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 tavelio, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium ruta-muraria. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly curled appearance. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or woodland areas. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium \u00d7 tavelio is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
