    "intro": "Arctostaphylos campbellae, commonly known as Campbell's manzanita, is a shrub native to California and Oregon. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, urn-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates with dry summers. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
