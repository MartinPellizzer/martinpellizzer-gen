    "intro": "Abies heterophylla, commonly known as the variable fir, is a species of coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinct foliage, which changes in appearance with age, featuring needle-like leaves on the lower branches and broader, flatter leaves higher up. The tree typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as mountainous regions, where it thrives in cool, moist climates. Its cones are small and reddish-brown, maturing within a single growing season. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies heterophylla is primarily native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is found in regions such as California, Nevada, and Arizona, as well as in northern Baja California. This species typically grows in high-elevation areas, often in coniferous forests. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils. Abies heterophylla is commonly associated with mountainous terrain and is an important component of subalpine ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies heterophylla was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and cool climates, typically found in mountainous regions. It is commonly found in the Pacific Northwest of the United States and parts of British Columbia. The plant thrives in USDA hardiness zones 4 through 7, where it can grow as a shade-tolerant evergreen. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and dense foliage. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts in non-native environments."
