It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and alternate, simple, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are monoecious, containing both male and female flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and wetlands. This species plays an important role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various wildlife species."
