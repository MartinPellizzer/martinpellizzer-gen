    "intro": "Atractylis babelii var. babelii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant features a rosette of broad, gray-green leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in the spring. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. The plant is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
