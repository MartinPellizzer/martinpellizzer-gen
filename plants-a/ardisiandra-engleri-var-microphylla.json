    "intro": "Ardisiandra engleri var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved ardisiandra, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers, followed by dark red berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a compact, shade-tolerant plant."
