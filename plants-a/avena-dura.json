    "intro": "Avena dura, commonly known as hard oat, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its robust, fibrous stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its seeds are encased in a hard, protective coat, aiding in seed dispersal and survival in harsh environments. Avena dura is often found in rocky or arid soils, demonstrating its resilience to drought and poor nutrient conditions."
