    "intro": "Astragalus gracilidentatus, commonly known as the slender-toothed milkvetch, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the western United States, particularly found in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant typically grows as a perennial herb with slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with finely divided, slender leaflets that give it a delicate appearance. Astragalus gracilidentatus is adapted to dry environments and plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat."
