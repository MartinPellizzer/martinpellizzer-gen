    "intro": "Acaena \u00d7 ovina subsp. maxima, commonly known as the New Zealand flax or k\u014dwhai, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces small, achene-like fruits that are dispersed by wind.

It is commonly found in temperate climates with well-drained soils. This subspecies thrives in open habitats such as grasslands, shrublands, and along coastal areas. It is often associated with disturbed sites and can be found in both coastal and inland regions. Its distribution is also influenced by its ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena \u00d7 ovina subsp. maxima was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of the Acaena genus for ornamental and horticultural purposes. This subspecies is commonly found in the coastal and subalpine regions of the country. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping due to its hardy nature. However, it has also become naturalized in certain areas, raising concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems."
