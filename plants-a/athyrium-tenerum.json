    "intro": "Athyrium tenerum, commonly known as the delicate fern or the Japanese forest fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a delicate and graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizome scales, which help in nutrient absorption. Athyrium tenerum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
