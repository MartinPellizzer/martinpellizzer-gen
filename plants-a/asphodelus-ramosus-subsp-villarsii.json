    "intro": "Asphodelus ramosus subsp. villarsii, commonly known as the Alpine asphodel, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, branched stems that bear small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is adapted to cold, rocky environments and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and is characteristic of high-altitude flora. Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary adaptation to harsh, arid conditions."
