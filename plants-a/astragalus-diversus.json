    "intro": "Astragalus diversus, commonly known as the variable milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Astragalus diversus is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a food source for various pollinators and wildlife."
