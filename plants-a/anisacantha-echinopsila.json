    "intro": "Anisacantha echinopsila, commonly known as the spiny milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by various pollinators. Its milky sap, which is toxic, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Anisacantha echinopsila is often found in rocky or sandy soils in arid environments."
