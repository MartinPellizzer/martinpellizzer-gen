    "intro": "Aspidium oppositum, commonly known as the opposite fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dimorphic fronds, with the sterile fronds being longer and more slender than the fertile ones. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fertile fronds, which are usually smaller and more compact.
