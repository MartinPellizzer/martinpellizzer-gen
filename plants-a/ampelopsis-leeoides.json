    "intro": "Ampelopsis leeoides, commonly known as the Chinese ivy, is a climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that give way to orange-red berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it suitable for shaded garden areas. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage and seasonal color changes, making it a popular choice for landscaping."
