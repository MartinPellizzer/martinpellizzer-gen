    "intro": "Archanthemis calcarea, commonly known as the limestone sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Archanthemis calcarea is adapted to rocky and calcareous soils, making it a common sight in limestone areas."
