    "intro": "Asplenium australasicum, commonly known as the common shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Australia and New Zealand. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth or on rocky outcrops. Asplenium australasicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive foliage."
