    "intro": "Astragalus remotus, commonly known as the distant milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Astragalus remotus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
