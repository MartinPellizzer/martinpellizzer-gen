    "intro": "Arabis vivariensis, commonly known as the coastal rockcress, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or rocky soils, often found along sea cliffs and dunes. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, spoon-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Arabis vivariensis is adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including strong winds and salt spray."
