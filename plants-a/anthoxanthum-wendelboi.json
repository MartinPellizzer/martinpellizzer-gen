    "intro": "Anthoxanthum wendelboi, commonly known as the Wendelbo's oat, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Botanically, it is notable for its distinctive floral structure and its role in ecological systems where it contributes to soil stabilization and biodiversity."
