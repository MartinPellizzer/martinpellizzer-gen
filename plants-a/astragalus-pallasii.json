    "intro": "Astragalus pallasii, commonly known as the Pallas' milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and parts of the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and steppe environments. Astragalus pallasii is also valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a food source for various herbivores."
