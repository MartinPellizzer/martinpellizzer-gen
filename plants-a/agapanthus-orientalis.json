    "intro": "Agapanthus orientalis, commonly known as the African lily, is a striking evergreen perennial native to southern Africa. It features dense, spherical clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, rising on sturdy stems from a rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant is well-suited for containers or garden beds, thriving in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil. Its foliage remains evergreen throughout the year, providing visual interest even when not in bloom. Agapanthus orientalis is drought-tolerant and attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
