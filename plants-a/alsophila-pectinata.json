    "intro": "Alsophila pectinata, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a fibrous, hairy layer that gives it its common name. The plant has a distinctive crown of large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Alsophila pectinata plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and shelter for various forest organisms."
