    "intro": "Acer monspessulanum subsp. monspessulanum, commonly known as the Spanish maple, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe and northern Africa. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring a broad, rounded crown and smooth, gray bark. The leaves are palmately lobed, with five to seven pointed lobes, and turn vibrant shades of yellow and orange in autumn. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or scrubland habitats.",
