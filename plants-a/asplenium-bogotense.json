    "intro": "Asplenium bogotense, commonly known as the Bogot\u00e1 spleenwort, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the high-altitude regions of Colombia. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in crevices in mountainous regions. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the undersides of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Asplenium bogotense is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
