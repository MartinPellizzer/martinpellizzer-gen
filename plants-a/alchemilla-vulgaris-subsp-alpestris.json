    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris subsp. alpestris, commonly known as alpine lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features dense, hairy leaves that are often silver-white beneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Alpestris is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
