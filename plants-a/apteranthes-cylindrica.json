It is a small annual herb that typically grows in dry, disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its common name. It plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and distribution."
