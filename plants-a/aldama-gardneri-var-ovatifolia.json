    "intro": "Aldama gardneri var. ovatifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf aldama, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapting to the harsh, dry environments it inhabits. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. This variety is valued for its resilience and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
