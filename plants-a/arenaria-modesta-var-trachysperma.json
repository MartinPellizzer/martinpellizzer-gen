    "intro": "Arenaria modesta var. trachysperma, commonly known as the rough-fruited sandparsley, is a low-growing perennial plant native to dry, rocky habitats in the western United States. It features a mat-forming growth habit with silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. Its fruit is a small, ribbed achene, which is adapted for wind dispersal. The species is characterized by its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils, making it an important component of its native ecosystem."
