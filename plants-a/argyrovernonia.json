    "intro": "Argyrovernonia, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage. The leaves are typically ovate or elliptic, with a waxy surface that reflects light, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. Argyrovernonia species often produce small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. These trees are valued for their ornamental qualities and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
