    "intro": "Astragalus strigosus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation, benefiting the surrounding soil. Astragalus strigosus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in restoration projects."
