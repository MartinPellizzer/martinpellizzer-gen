    "intro": "Amellus tridactylus subsp. arenarius, commonly known as the sand dune bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, typically found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats. The plant produces showy blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and supporting local pollinators."
