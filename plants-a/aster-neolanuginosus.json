    "intro": "Aster neolanuginosus, commonly known as the woolly aster, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern South America. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Its foliage is covered in fine, lanuginous hairs, giving it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. Aster neolanuginosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique visual characteristics."
