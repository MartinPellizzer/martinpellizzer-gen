    "intro": "Andropogon grandiflorus, commonly known as big bluestem, is a tallgrass species native to the tallgrass prairie ecosystems of North America. It is a perennial grass that typically grows between 1 to 3 meters in height, featuring a distinctive blue-green color during the growing season. The plant has a robust root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a prominent midrib, and it produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers. Big bluestem plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of prairie habitats."
