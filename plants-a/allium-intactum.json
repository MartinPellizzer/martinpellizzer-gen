    "intro": "Allium intactum, commonly known as the Armenian garlic, is a bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves and small, white to pale purple flowers. The plant produces a bulb composed of several layers of fleshy, white or pale yellow scales, which are used in traditional medicine and cuisine. Allium intactum is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its botanical features make it distinct from other allium species, particularly in its floral structure and habitat preferences."
