    "intro": "Apiastrum angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved apiastrum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear narrow, lance-shaped leaves arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in its native range."
