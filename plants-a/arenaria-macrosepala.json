    "intro": "Arenaria macrosepala, commonly known as the large-sepaled sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a mat-forming habit, typically found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Arenaria macrosepala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
