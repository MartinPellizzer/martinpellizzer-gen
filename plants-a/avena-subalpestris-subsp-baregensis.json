    "intro": "Avena subalpestris subsp. baregensis, commonly known as the Baregenian oat, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, characterized by its ability to thrive in cold and nutrient-poor soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed florets. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in high-altitude environments."
