    "intro": "Asperula aristata f. scabridula, commonly known as the scabrous woodruff, is a compact, low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough, scabrous texture, which gives the plant its specific epithet. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and historical use in herbal medicine."
