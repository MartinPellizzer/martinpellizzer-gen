    "intro": "Arethusa racemosa, commonly known as the sea onion, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the United States and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in brackish or saltwater environments, often found in tidal marshes and estuaries. Its roots are adapted to tolerate fluctuating salinity levels, making it a hardy species in coastal ecosystems. Arethusa racemosa plays a role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
