    "intro": "Asphodelus fistulosus var. genuinus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved asphodel, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, upright flower stalks that bear clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in sunny, well-drained habitats. It is part of the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its fibrous root system and tubular flowers. This variety is less common than the typical form of Asphodelus fistulosus and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
