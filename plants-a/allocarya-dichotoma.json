The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically found in clusters at the tips of the stems. Allocarya dichotoma is native to arid and semi-arid regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of desert ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various insect species."
