    "intro": "Arida coulteri, commonly known as the Texas mountain laurel, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and showy clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a thick, woody stem with a rough, fissured bark that becomes more pronounced with age. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a slight twist, while its fruit is a flat, leathery pod containing several seeds. Arida coulteri is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and open plains."
