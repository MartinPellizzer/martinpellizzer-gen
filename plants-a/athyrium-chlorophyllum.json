    "intro": "Athyrium chlorophyllum, commonly known as the green lace fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically a vibrant green color. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that give it a lacy appearance. Athyrium chlorophyllum prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
