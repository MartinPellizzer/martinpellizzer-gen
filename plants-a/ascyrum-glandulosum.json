    "intro": "Ascyrum glandulosum, commonly known as the sticky bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and is often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are usually thin and ribbon-like, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. Ascyrum glandulosum is notable for its unique adaptations that allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor aquatic environments."
