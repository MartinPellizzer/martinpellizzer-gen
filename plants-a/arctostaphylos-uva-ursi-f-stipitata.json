    "intro": "Arctostaphylos uva-ursi f. stipitata, commonly known as the dwarf bearberry, is a low-growing shrub characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically evergreen, with a leathery texture and a waxy coating. The plant produces tiny, urn-shaped flowers that are usually pink to white in color, followed by red or orange berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arctic regions. This subspecies is notable for its resilience to harsh environmental conditions and its role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas."
