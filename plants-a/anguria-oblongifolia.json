    "intro": "Anguria oblongifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf anguria, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its oblong, glossy leaves that are often arranged in a whorled pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its fruit, though not widely cultivated, is edible and has a mild, sweet flavor. Anguria oblongifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks."
