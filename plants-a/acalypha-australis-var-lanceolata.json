    "intro": "Acalypha australis var. lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in coastal landscaping for its hardiness. The leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha australis var. lanceolata is primarily native to eastern Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory. This variant is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in sandy or loamy soils. It thrives in regions with a subtropical to temperate climate, characterized by mild winters and warm, humid summers. The plant is typically found in open woodlands, heathlands, and along coastal dunes. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity and stabilizing coastal ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha australis var. lanceolata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. The distribution of this species has been primarily confined to cultivated areas and gardens. Despite its introduction, it has not become naturalized in the wild in New Zealand. It is considered a non-native plant in the region."
