    "intro": "Acinopetala gutierrezii, commonly known as the Guti\u00e9rrez's acinopetala, is a rare and striking plant native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Its unique floral structure attracts specific pollinators, such as hummingbirds and certain species of bees. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts.",
