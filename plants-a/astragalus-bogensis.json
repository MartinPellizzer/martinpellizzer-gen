    "intro": "Astragalus bogensis, commonly known as the bog milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to wetland and bog environments in northern regions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with numerous leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus bogensis is adapted to nutrient-poor, moist soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. It is also of interest in botanical research due to its unique ecological niche and potential medicinal properties."
