    "intro": "Arctium orientale, commonly known as the oriental burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, covered with dense, prickly bracts. The plant produces large, purple flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by the development of spiky, bur-like fruits. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and have a rough, hairy texture. The roots of Arctium orientale are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
