    "intro": "Arundarbor fera, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its broad, silvery-green leaves that are covered in fine, reflective hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from pale purple to deep violet, typically blooming in late spring. Its fruit is a toxic berry that ripens to a dark red or black color, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its toxic properties, it is often found in shaded, moist woodland areas where it thrives in partial to full shade."
