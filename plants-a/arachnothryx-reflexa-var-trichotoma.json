    "intro": "Arachnothryx reflexa var. trichotoma, commonly known as the hairy arachnothryx, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its specific epithet \"trichotoma.\" The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a distinctive papilionaceous structure. The seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds through mechanical means."
