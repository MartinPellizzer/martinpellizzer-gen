    "intro": "Asclepias scaposa, commonly known as showy milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern and central United States. It features upright stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with reddish veins. The plant produces clusters of intricate, yellow-veined flowers that attract a variety of pollinators, including butterflies and bees. Its sap contains latex, which is toxic to some animals but essential for the survival of monarch butterflies. Asclepias scaposa plays a vital role in supporting local ecosystems and is a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
