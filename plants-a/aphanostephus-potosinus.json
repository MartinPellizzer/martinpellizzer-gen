    "intro": "Aphanostephus potosinus, commonly known as the Potosi milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, and it is known for its milky sap, which is typical of the genus. Aphanostephus potosinus plays a role in supporting local pollinators, though it is less commonly cultivated than other milkweed species."
