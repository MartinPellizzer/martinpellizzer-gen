    "intro": "Abies canadensis microphylla, commonly known as the balsam fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dense, dark green foliage. The needles are short, flat, and often have two white stomatal lines on their upper surface. It produces cone-like structures that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing seeds dispersed by wind. This species thrives in cool, moist environments and is an important component of boreal and temperate forest ecosystems.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies canadensis microphylla is primarily native to the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is found in regions such as New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and parts of Quebec. This species typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in mixed forests and along river valleys. It is commonly associated with mountainous and upland habitats. Its native range extends into the Appalachian Mountains and the Canadian Shield.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies canadensis microphylla was mainly introduced to the northeastern United States and parts of eastern Canada. It was brought for its ornamental value, including its dense foliage and pyramidal shape. This species is often planted in gardens and as a landscape tree due to its hardiness and adaptability. However, it has also been reported to escape cultivation in some areas, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. Its introduction has had both aesthetic and ecological impacts in the regions where it has become established."
