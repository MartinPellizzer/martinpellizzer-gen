    "intro": "Aristida scabrivalvis subsp. contracta, commonly known as the rough-fringed grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, linear leaves with a rough, scabrous texture on both surfaces. The inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-ranked spikelets. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. This subspecies is adapted to withstand drought and is an important component of the native flora in its habitat."
