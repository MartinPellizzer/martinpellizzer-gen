    "intro": "Agave spicata, commonly known as the spiny agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage composed of thick, spiny leaves that can grow up to 3 feet in length. The leaves are typically blue-green in color and have a rough, textured surface. It produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears small, white flowers, which bloom in the spring. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
