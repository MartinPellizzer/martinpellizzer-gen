    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon pringlei is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Texas. This plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in desert and semi-arid environments. It is commonly associated with areas that have low rainfall and high sun exposure. Abutilon pringlei is often seen in canyon walls, cliffs, and disturbed sites within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon pringlei was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, disturbed areas such as riverbanks and forest edges. This plant has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its distribution is primarily associated with riparian habitats and human-altered landscapes."
