    "intro": "Antennaria luzuloides, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a cushion-like growth form, with densely packed, hairy leaves that help it survive in cold, windy environments. Its flowers are typically pink to purple in color and are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Antennaria luzuloides is adapted to rocky and alpine soils, thriving in areas with poor nutrient content and intense sunlight."
