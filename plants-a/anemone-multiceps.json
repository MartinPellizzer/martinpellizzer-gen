It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers with numerous stamens, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are borne on long, slender pedicels, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded woodland habitats.
