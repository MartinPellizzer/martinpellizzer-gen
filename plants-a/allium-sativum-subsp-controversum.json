It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, pale purple or white flowers. The plant produces small, white, spherical bulbs that are edible and have a strong garlic-like flavor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its aromatic compounds, it has been used traditionally in culinary and medicinal applications."
