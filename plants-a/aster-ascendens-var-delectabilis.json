It features upright stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, adorned with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of purple, blue, and white, typically blooming from late summer to early fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
