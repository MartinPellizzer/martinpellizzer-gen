    "intro": "Acacia sclerosperma subsp. sclerosperma, commonly known as the hard-seeded acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and phyllodes that are typically straight or slightly curved. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical inflorescences, which are followed by hard, woody pods containing the seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The subspecies is notable for its resilience and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of firewood.",

This subspecies is found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in the area around the Fitzgerald River National Park. It typically grows in sandy soils and is commonly found in open woodlands and shrublands. The plant is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid conditions of its native habitat. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia sclerosperma subsp. sclerosperma was mainly introduced to Palestine. It is a shrub or small tree native to Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. The introduction to Palestine is likely due to its use in traditional medicine and as a source of timber. It has adapted well to the local climate and soil conditions. However, its spread requires monitoring to prevent potential ecological impacts."
