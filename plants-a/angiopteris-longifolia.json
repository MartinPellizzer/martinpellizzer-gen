    "intro": "Angiopteris longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically submerged or floating in still or slow-moving freshwater. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of rivers. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spores are dispersed through the water. Angiopteris longifolia plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis."
