    "intro": "Ardisia parvissima, commonly known as the dwarf beautyberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are a striking feature. These fruits are edible for birds but not for humans, making the plant an important part of local ecosystems. Ardisia parvissima thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, often found in forest understories."
