    "intro": "Aegilops \u00d7 vulgaritriaristata, commonly known as the wild rye grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields and along roadsides. This species is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for improving wheat genetics through hybridization."
