    "intro": "Anaglypha, commonly known as the glassy fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, glass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in woodland areas. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbels, a common feature in the Apiaceae family. Anaglypha species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
