It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to dry environments, with deep taproots that allow it to access groundwater. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife, though it is not widely cultivated for agricultural purposes."
