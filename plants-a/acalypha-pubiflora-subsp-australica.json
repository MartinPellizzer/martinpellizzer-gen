    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha pubiflora subsp. australica is primarily native to the Northern Territory, Queensland, and Western Australia. This species is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these states. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along creek lines and in open woodlands. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for native fauna.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha pubiflora subsp. australica was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. This species has since become naturalized in certain areas, particularly in the northern parts of the country. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in disturbed soils. However, its spread is limited compared to other invasive species in the region."
