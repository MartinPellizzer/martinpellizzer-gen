    "intro": "Amorphophallus zenkeri, commonly known as the giant swamp arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, fleshy underground tuber, which can grow up to 2 meters in height when in bloom. The plant produces a striking, spiky inflorescence that resembles a phallic shape, hence its common name. Its leaves are broad and arrow-shaped, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The tuber is edible and has been used in traditional cuisines, though it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique flowering structure."
