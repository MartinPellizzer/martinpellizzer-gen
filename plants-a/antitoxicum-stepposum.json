    "intro": "Antitoxicum stepposum, commonly known as the steppe antitoxic, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the steppes of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. It features wiry stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue or white flowers during the summer months. It is adapted to dry, nutrient-poor soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats. While not widely cultivated, it has been studied for its potential medicinal properties due to its reported detoxifying effects."
