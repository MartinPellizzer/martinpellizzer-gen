It features a slender, upright stem covered in soft, velvety hairs, and its leaves are heart-shaped with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of pale pink to white flowers during the summer months, which are borne on long, slender pedicels. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Andryala nemausensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity in wetland ecosystems."
