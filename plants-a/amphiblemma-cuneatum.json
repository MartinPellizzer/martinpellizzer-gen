    "intro": "Amphiblemma cuneatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It possesses small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which it uses to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant has slender, branching stems with tiny, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically small and greenish-white, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Amphiblemma cuneatum thrives in nutrient-poor waters, relying on its specialized adaptations to obtain essential nutrients."
