    "intro": "Aster sublitoralis, commonly known as the salt marsh aster, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of North America. It thrives in brackish and saline environments, often found in salt marshes and tidal flats. The plant produces showy, violet-blue to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand salt spray and periodic flooding. Aster sublitoralis plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing coastal soils."
