    "intro": "Aconitum anthora var. anthoroideum, commonly known as the Alpine monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features striking blue to violet flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape, typical of the genus Aconitum. The plant has palmately divided, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.",
