    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria proles maritima, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flowers and feathery foliage, which help it withstand salty air and strong winds. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found along shorelines and dunes. It produces small, pod-like fruits that disperse its seeds via the wind. This species plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for small insects."
