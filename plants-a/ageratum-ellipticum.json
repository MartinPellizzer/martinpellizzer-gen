It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to purple. The leaves are elliptical in shape, hence the species name, and are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in ornamental gardening for its vibrant blooms. The plant is also valued for its ability to attract beneficial insects like butterflies and bees."
