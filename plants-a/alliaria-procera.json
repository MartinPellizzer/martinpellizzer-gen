    "intro": "Alliaria procera, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It has pinnately compound leaves that are alternate and often have a peppery scent when crushed. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers in clusters during early spring. Its fruit is a triangular, three-lobed seed pod that splits open to release tiny seeds. Alliaria procera is known for its allelopathic properties, which can inhibit the growth of other plants."
