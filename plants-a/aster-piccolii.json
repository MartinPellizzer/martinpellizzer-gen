    "intro": "Aster piccolii, commonly known as the alpine aster, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with silver. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, which bloom from late summer to early autumn. Its fibrous root system helps it thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. Aster piccolii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to flourish in alpine environments."
