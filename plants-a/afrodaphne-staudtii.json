    "intro": "Afrodaphne staudtii, commonly known as the Staudt's sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its scent and durability. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are glossy and often fragrant, and it produces small, white, fragrant flowers. Afrodaphne staudtii is typically found in sandy soils along the coast, where it thrives in warm, humid conditions. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
