    "intro": "Arenaria nemorosa var. quitensis, commonly known as the Andean sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It typically thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often found in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually succulent and covered in fine hairs, helping to retain moisture in harsh conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas."
