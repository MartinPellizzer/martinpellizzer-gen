    "intro": "Alsophila quadrata, commonly known as the broad-leaf huperzia, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The fronds are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, with a distinctive, quadrangular cross-section that gives it its scientific name."
