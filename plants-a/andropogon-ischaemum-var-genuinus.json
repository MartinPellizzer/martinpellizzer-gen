It is characterized by its slender, blue-green leaves and tufted inflorescences that produce small, pale blue flowers. This plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization and habitat for various wildlife. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration projects."
