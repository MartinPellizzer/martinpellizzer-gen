    "intro": "Acaena \u00d7 anserovina, commonly known as the silverweed or New Zealand spinach, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, spiky fruits that contain edible seeds. The plant is native to New Zealand and is often found in moist, temperate environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, with a silver-white underside that gives it its common name. Acaena \u00d7 anserovina is valued for its nutritional content and is sometimes cultivated as a leafy vegetable.",

This plant is commonly found in coastal and dry grassland habitats across these regions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed or open vegetation types. The species is known for its persistent, spiny bracts and small, clustered flowers. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena \u00d7 anserovina was mainly introduced to New Zealand North and New Zealand South. It is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Acaena angustata and Acaena anserifolia. This species has been cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowering characteristics. However, it has also been reported to have potential invasive tendencies in certain areas. Its distribution is primarily limited to the regions where it was intentionally introduced."
