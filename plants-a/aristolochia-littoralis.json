    "intro": "Aristolochia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a climbing vine that produces unique, pipe-shaped flowers that are often green or reddish in color. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils along coastal areas and is often found in wetlands or near waterways. Its flowers have a strong, often unpleasant odor that attracts certain pollinators like flies. The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals, making it important to handle with care."
