    "intro": "Arnica terrae-novae, commonly known as the Newfoundland arnica, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Newfoundland. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal heaths and bogs. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Arnica terrae-novae is valued for its medicinal properties, though it is generally less commercially cultivated than other arnica species."
