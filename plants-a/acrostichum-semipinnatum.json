    "intro": "Acrostichum semipinnatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf brake, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its feathery, compound fronds that are typically narrow and elongated. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or near water sources. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can spread to form dense colonies. The leaves are usually dimorphic, with sterile and fertile fronds differing in structure and appearance.",
