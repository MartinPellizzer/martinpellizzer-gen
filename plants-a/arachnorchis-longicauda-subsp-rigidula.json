    "intro": "Arachnorchis longicauda subsp. rigidula, commonly known as the rigid-tailed spider orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and rigidly tapered flower spike, which gives it its subspecific name. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a unique, spider-like appearance that contributes to its common name. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
