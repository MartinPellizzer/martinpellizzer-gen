    "intro": "Armeniaca \u00d7 dasycarpa, commonly known as the Chinese date or jujube. It is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Prunus armeniaca (the common peach) and Prunus dasycarpa (a wild species native to China). The plant is characterized by its thorny stems and large, fuzzy red fruits that are rich in sugars and nutrients. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its edible fruit. The botanical features of Armeniaca \u00d7 dasycarpa make it a valuable species in both horticulture and traditional medicine."
