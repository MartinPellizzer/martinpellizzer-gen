    "intro": "Asplenium columbiense, commonly known as the Columbia maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and allow it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation. The leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that resembles the feathers of a bird."
