    "intro": "Astragalus coluteocarpus subsp. coluteocarpus, commonly known as the yellow milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats. Due to its ecological importance, it is sometimes used in restoration projects to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
