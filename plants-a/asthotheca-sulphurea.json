    "intro": "Asthotheca sulphurea, commonly known as the sulfur cup lichen, is a member of the family Xanthopsoraceae. It is a crustose lichen that forms a dense, yellowish to orange-brown coating on rock surfaces, particularly in arid or semi-arid environments. The lichen's thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to survive in harsh conditions. It is often found in regions with low humidity and high sunlight exposure. The sulfur cup lichen is notable for its vivid coloration, which is due to the presence of pigments produced by the algal component."
