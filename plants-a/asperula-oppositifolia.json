    "intro": "Asperula oppositifolia, commonly known as the oppositeleaf woodruff, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It features small, opposite leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of delicate white flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, dark blue berries. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Asperula oppositifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
