    "intro": "Angiopteris undulato-striata, commonly known as the wavy-striated water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into segments with a wavy, striated appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread rapidly. The fronds are usually a deep green, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture in humid conditions."
