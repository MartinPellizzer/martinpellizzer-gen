    "intro": "Arenaria stricta var. puberulenta, commonly known as the woolly sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. Its leaves are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas."
