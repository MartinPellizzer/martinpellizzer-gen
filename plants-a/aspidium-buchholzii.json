    "intro": "Aspidium buchholzii, commonly known as the African shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizome is creeping and produces roots that help anchor it to the substrate. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
