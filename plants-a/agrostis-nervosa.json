    "intro": "Agrostis nervosa, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with prominent veins, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, and it is often found in association with other grasses and forbs. Agrostis nervosa is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates."
