    "intro": "Allosorus pteridioides, commonly known as the common rock fern, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Allosorus pteridioides is notable for its adaptability to various soil types and its role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats."
