    "intro": "Allium runyonii, commonly known as the Runyon's garlic, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the southwestern United States. It is a bulbous perennial that produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters. The plant belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves. Its bulbs are similar to those of other allium species but are less commonly cultivated. Due to habitat loss, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
