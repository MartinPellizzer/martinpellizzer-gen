    "intro": "Agropyron truncatum, commonly known as the rough bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows, prairies, and disturbed areas. Agropyron truncatum is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
