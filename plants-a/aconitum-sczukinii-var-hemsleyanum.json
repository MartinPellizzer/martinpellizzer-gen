    "intro": "Aconitum sczukinii var. hemsleyanum, commonly known as the Hemsley's monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking blue to purple, helmet-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has compound, pinnately arranged leaves with deeply cut lobes, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
