    "intro": "Allium trachyanthum, commonly known as the purple onion or wild leek, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a tall, leafless stem bearing a cluster of small, spherical, purple or pink flowers. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild garlic-like flavor, making it a valuable plant in both culinary and medicinal contexts. Allium trachyanthum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in grasslands and rocky areas."
