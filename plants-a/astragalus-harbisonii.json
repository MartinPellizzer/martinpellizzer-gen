    "intro": "Astragalus harbisonii, commonly known as Harbison's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and open woodlands. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several pairs of leaflets, and it produces pods that contain small, hard seeds. Astragalus harbisonii is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has adaptations that allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
