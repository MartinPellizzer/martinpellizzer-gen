    "intro": "Adenostegia parryi, commonly known as Parry's milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five pink to reddish-purple petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milky sap, which gives it its common name, contains toxic compounds that deter herbivores. Adenostegia parryi plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for native pollinators such as bees and butterflies.",
