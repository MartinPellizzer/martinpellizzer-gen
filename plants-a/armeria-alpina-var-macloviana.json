    "intro": "Armeria alpina var. macloviana, commonly known as the Alpine thrift, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a low-growing perennial that produces dense clusters of white or pinkish flowers in early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine hairs, typical of many alpine species. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
