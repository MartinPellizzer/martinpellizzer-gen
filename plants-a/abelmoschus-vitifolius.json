    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelmoschus vitifolius is primarily native to southern and eastern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Kenya, Tanzania, and Mozambique. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with warm climates and well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in savannahs, grasslands, and along riverbanks. It is often used for its edible seeds and has cultural significance in some local communities. Its natural range extends into parts of the Arabian Peninsula as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus vitifolius was mainly introduced to areas with warm climates and well-drained soils, where it can thrive as an ornamental and potentially medicinal plant. It is often cultivated in regions of South Asia, the Middle East, and parts of Africa due to its adaptability to tropical and subtropical environments. The plant is valued for its large, heart-shaped leaves and its potential use in traditional medicine. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems. Despite its benefits, careful management is necessary to prevent unintended ecological impacts."
