    "intro": "Agrostis pisidica, commonly known as the lesser wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist meadows, riverbanks, and other damp habitats, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 50 cm, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are usually arranged in a loose panicle, bearing small, two-lobed glumes. Agrostis pisidica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
