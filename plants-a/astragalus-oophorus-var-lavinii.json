    "intro": "Astragalus oophorus var. lavinii, commonly known as the lavender milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, often with a distinctive lavender hue. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping. The plant's ability to fix nitrogen through its root nodules makes it beneficial for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
