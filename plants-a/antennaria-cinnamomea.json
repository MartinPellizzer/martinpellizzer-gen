    "intro": "Antennaria cinnamomea, commonly known as the cinnamon sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, branched stems and small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are usually hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The species is noted for its ability to survive in cold climates and is sometimes used in rock gardens due to its ornamental appearance."
