    "intro": "Arenaria holostea, commonly known as the sea sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in maritime environments where salt spray is common. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, arid conditions. Its flowers, which are typically white or pink, bloom in early spring and are arranged in dense clusters. Arenaria holostea is well adapted to coastal ecosystems and plays a role in stabilizing dune environments."
