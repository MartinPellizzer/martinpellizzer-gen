    "intro": "Atraphaxis botuliformis, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited to harsh, drought-prone environments. Due to its resilience, it is often used in xeriscaping and habitat restoration projects."
