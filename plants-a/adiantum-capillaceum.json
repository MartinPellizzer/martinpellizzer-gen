    "intro": "Adiantum capillaceum, commonly known as the hair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, lacy fronds that give it a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or near streams. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, allowing it to spread slowly over time. Adiantum capillaceum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens with the right humidity and light conditions.",
