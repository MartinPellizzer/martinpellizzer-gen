It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces slender, erect stems that bear lance-shaped leaves with a distinct, fragrant aroma. Its flowering stems are often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. The fruit, which is a small, three-lobed capsule, contains aromatic seeds used in both culinary and medicinal applications."
