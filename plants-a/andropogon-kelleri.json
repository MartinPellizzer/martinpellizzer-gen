    "intro": "Andropogon kelleri, commonly known as the dwarf panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in shaded to partially shaded environments. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Andropogon kelleri is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
