    "intro": "Anthemis camptocarpa, commonly known as the bentstem ragwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Its yellow-orange flowers bloom in the summer, and the plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Anthemis camptocarpa is generally not considered invasive and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
