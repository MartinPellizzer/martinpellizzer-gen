    "intro": "Adelbertia calophylla, commonly known as the Queensland bottle tree, is a unique and striking plant native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its thick, bottle-shaped trunk that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The tree has compound leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, appearing in clusters along the branches. Adelbertia calophylla is well adapted to drought and is often found in dry tropical and subtropical regions.",
