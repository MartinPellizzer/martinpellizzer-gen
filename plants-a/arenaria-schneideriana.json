    "intro": "Arenaria schneideriana, commonly known as Schneiderean sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its succulent, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Arenaria schneideriana thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats."
