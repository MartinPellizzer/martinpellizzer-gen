    "intro": "Alchemilla pantocsekii, commonly known as the Hungarian lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Hungary and parts of Croatia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that forms a mat-like structure. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in branched cymes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Alchemilla pantocsekii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
