    "intro": "Alectoroctonum scotanum, commonly known as the shadow thorn, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the dense, shaded understories of temperate forests. It possesses thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in low-light conditions, and its flowers are small, clustered, and typically pale green or white. The plant's root system is extensive, allowing it to absorb nutrients from the rich, decomposing leaf litter. It is known for its slow growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it a unique subject of botanical study. However, due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many regions."
