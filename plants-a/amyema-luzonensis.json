    "intro": "Amyema luzonensis, commonly known as the Luzon amyema, is a rare flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has hairy leaves and stems, which are typical features of many species in its family. It grows in moist, shaded areas of montane forests, often in association with other endemic flora. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Amyema luzonensis is considered a vulnerable species."
