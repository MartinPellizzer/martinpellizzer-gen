    "intro": "Artemisia tripartita subsp. tripartita, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage with silvery-white undersides, and it produces small, yellowish flower heads that appear in late summer. The plant contains volatile oils, including thujone, which contribute to its strong, bitter scent and medicinal properties. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its chemical composition, it has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent."
