    "intro": "Andira coriacea, commonly known as the rough andira, is a woody shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its rough, bark-like texture on its stems and leaves, which are typically elliptical and opposite in arrangement. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbels, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals. Andira coriacea is often found in humid, shaded environments such as forest understories."
