It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds. The plant has a distinctive, fibrous trunk that is covered with a layer of dead, persistent leaves. Its fronds are typically arranged in a compact, rosette-like pattern at the top of the trunk.
