    "intro": "Asplundia chiapensis, commonly known as the Chiapas arrowroot, is a flowering plant native to Central America, particularly found in the humid lowland forests of Chiapas, Mexico. It belongs to the family Cyclanthaceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are used as a starch source. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention in its tropical environment. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the wet season. Asplundia chiapensis is an important species for both local biodiversity and traditional agriculture in its native region."
