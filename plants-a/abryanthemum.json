    "intro": "Abryanthemum, commonly known as the African daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that come in a variety of colors, including yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Its foliage is generally gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Abryanthemum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
