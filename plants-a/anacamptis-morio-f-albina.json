    "intro": "Anacamptis morio f. albina, commonly known as the white marsh orchid, is a rare and striking variant of the common marsh orchid. It is characterized by its pale white to almost entirely white flowers, which contrast sharply with the green foliage. This orchid is native to parts of Europe and is often found in wet meadows and marshy areas. Its flowers are spurred at the base, a distinctive feature of the Orchidaceae family. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm and blooms from late spring to early summer."
