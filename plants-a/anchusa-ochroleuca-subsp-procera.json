    "intro": "Anchusa ochroleuca subsp. procera, commonly known as the tall blueweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often branching near the top. The plant produces clusters of bright blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, with a strong, aromatic scent. This species is often found in rocky or gravelly soils along coastal areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
