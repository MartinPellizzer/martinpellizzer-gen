    "intro": "Apera procumbens, commonly known as common bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth on the ground, with slender, often prostrate stems that can spread over large areas. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered in fine hairs, while the inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged along the stem. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. This plant is known for its adaptability and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
