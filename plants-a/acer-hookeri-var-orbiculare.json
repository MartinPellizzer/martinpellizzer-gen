    "intro": "Acer hookeri var. orbiculare, commonly known as the broad-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its orbicular or round-shaped leaves that are typically bright green on the upper surface and pale underneath. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its distinctive foliage.",
