    "intro": "Astragalus australis var. glaberrimus, commonly known as the smooth astragalus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Australia. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features upright, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that are usually pale yellow to brown in color. Its leaves are pinnately divided and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variant is distinguished by its smooth, hairless appearance compared to other varieties of Astragalus australis."
