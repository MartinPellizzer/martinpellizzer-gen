This subspecies thrives in dry, open habitats such as shrublands and grasslands. It is commonly associated with coastal and inland areas with well-drained soils. The plant is part of the bramble family and is known for its distinctive spiny fruits.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena \u00d7 ovina subsp. monachaena was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of the Acaena genus for ornamental purposes. This subspecies has since become naturalized in certain regions of the country. It is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in disturbed soils. However, it is not considered invasive and has a limited ecological impact."
