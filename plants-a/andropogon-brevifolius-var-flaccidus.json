    "intro": "Andropogon brevifolius var. flaccidus, commonly known as the Florida panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are arranged in panicles, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This variant is distinguished by its shorter, more floppy leaves compared to other varieties of Andropogon brevifolius."
