It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are bi- or tri-pinnate, with closely spaced, needle-like pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its rhizomes are short and often covered in a dense mat of roots. Adiantum macropterum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, indoor conditions.",
