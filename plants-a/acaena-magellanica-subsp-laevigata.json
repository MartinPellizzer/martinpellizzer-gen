    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena magellanica subsp. laevigata is primarily native to southern South America, including parts of Chile and Argentina. It is commonly found in temperate regions, particularly in the Valdivian temperate rainforest. This subspecies thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. It is often associated with coastal and montane habitats. Its distribution extends into the southern Andes, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena magellanica subsp. laevigata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of the Acaena genus for ornamental purposes. This subspecies is now considered an environmental weed in certain regions of New Zealand. It thrives in disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation. Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its invasive potential."
