    "intro": "Alepidea woodii, commonly known as the Wood's leek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, white to greenish flowers that bloom in the spring. Alepidea woodii is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in chaparral and woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
