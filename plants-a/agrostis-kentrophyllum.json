    "intro": "Agrostis kentrophyllum, commonly known as the Kent's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and is often found in dry, rocky, or disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to arid conditions and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities in its habitat."
