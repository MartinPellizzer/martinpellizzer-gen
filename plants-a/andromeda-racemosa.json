It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along stream banks. Its leaves are small, oval-shaped, and have a leathery texture, while its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Andromeda racemosa plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various wildlife species."
