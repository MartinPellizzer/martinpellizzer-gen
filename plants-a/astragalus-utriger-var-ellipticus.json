    "intro": "Astragalus utriger var. ellipticus, commonly known as the elliptic milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically followed by pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It is adapted to grow in sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant. This species is valued in traditional medicine and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
