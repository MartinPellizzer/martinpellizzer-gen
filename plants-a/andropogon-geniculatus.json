    "intro": "Andropogon geniculatus, commonly known as switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. This plant is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy species. Switchgrass is widely used in restoration projects and as a bioenergy crop due to its high biomass yield. Its flowering inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets that produce small, wind-dispersed seeds."
