    "intro": "Avena strigosa var. pseudoabyssinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian oat, is a perennial grass species native to Ethiopia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in high-altitude regions with cool, temperate climates and well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
