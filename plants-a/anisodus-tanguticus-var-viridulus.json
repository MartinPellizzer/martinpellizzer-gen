    "intro": "Anisodus tanguticus var. viridulus, commonly known as the green anisodus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet and other parts of Central Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in arid to semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Due to its medicinal and toxic properties, it is of interest to botanists and pharmacologists."
