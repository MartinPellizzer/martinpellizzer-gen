    "intro": "Adinauclea, commonly known as the African wild bean, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to Africa. The plants are characterized by their compound leaves and small, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds. Adinauclea species are often found in dry, sandy soils and are adapted to arid environments. They play a role in traditional medicine and are sometimes used as a food source in local communities."
