    "intro": "Aspidopterys lanuginosa, commonly known as the silky mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaraceae. It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant attaches itself to the branches of host trees, such as pines and firs, drawing water and nutrients from them. Its fruit produces small, sticky seeds that are dispersed by birds, aiding in its propagation. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range."
