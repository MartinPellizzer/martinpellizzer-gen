    "intro": "Aloe andohahelensis, commonly known as the Madagascar aloe, is a succulent plant native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the Asphodelaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick and fleshy, adapted for storing water. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow-orange flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that has been traditionally used for its soothing properties. Aloe andohahelensis is well-suited to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
