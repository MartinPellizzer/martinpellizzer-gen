    "intro": "Aconitum pyramidale var. elongatum, commonly known as the elongated monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking blue to violet flowers arranged in a spire-like inflorescence, which is characteristic of the Aconitum genus. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly rough texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in areas where children or pets are present.",
