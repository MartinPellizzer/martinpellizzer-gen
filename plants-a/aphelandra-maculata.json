    "intro": "Aphelandra maculata, commonly known as the spotted flame plant, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It belongs to the Arecaceae family, commonly known as the palm family, though it is not a true palm. The plant is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that range from yellow to red, with a central spadix that bears small, inconspicuous flowers. Its leaves are large, glossy, and often have a veined appearance, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Aphelandra maculata thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical gardens and indoor spaces."
