It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and hairy foliage, which gives it its varietal name. The plant produces spikelets that are typically borne in loose, ascending clusters along the stem. Its leaves are narrow and have a rough texture, while the inflorescence consists of small, pale green to brown flowers. Aegilops ovata var. puberula is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to semi-arid environments."
