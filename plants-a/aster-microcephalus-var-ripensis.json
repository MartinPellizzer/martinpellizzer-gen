It typically grows in moist soils along stream banks and wetlands, thriving in full sun to partial shade. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white to pale blue. Its flowering period occurs in the late summer to early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The riparian aster plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
