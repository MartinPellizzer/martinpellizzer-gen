    "intro": "Anthyllis sericea subsp. henoniana, commonly known as the silky anthyllis, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its finely hairy, silver-green foliage and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Native to the Mediterranean region, this subspecies thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Its growth habit is typically prostrate or low-growing, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in nutrient-poor environments."
