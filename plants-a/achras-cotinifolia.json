    "intro": "Achras cotinifolia, commonly known as the silk floss tree, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves and striking, fluffy white flowers that resemble cotton. The plant produces bright red, berry-like fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy pulp. Its most distinctive feature is the long, silky fibers that emerge from its flowers, which are used in traditional crafts and as a natural fiber source. The silk floss tree is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance and ecological importance in its native habitat.",
