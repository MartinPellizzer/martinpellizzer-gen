    "intro": "Anemone pratensis f. bracteata, commonly known as the bracted meadow anemone, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and often covered in fine hairs. Its distinctive bracts, which are modified leaves at the base of the flower cluster, give it its specific epithet. This variety is often found in moist meadows and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
