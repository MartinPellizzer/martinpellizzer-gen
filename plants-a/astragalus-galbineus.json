    "intro": "Astragalus galbineus, commonly known as the Galbineus milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces trifoliate leaves and possesses a deep taproot system, which helps it survive in arid and rocky environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and dry grasslands, where it plays a role in soil stabilization. Astragalus galbineus is also valued for its potential medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
