    "intro": "Anemone flaccida var. semiplena, commonly known as the semi-double anemone, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features showy, pink to lilac flowers with a semi-double petal structure, giving it a more elaborate appearance than the standard variety. The plant has basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and its stems are typically hairy as well. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable climates."
