    "intro": "Adonis vernalis var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy spring adonis, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features basal rosettes of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in its alpine habitat. The plant produces striking clusters of bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers in early spring, typically before the leaves fully expand. Its flowers are characterized by numerous stamens and a central pistil, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The hairy texture of its leaves and stems is a distinguishing feature of this variant.",
