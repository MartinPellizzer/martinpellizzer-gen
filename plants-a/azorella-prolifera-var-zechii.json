    "intro": "Azorella prolifera var. zechii, commonly known as the Zech's cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit with tightly packed, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. It is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cold, arid conditions with poor soil. Azorella prolifera var. zechii is also known for its ability to form extensive cushions that can persist for decades, making it a notable species in alpine ecosystems."
