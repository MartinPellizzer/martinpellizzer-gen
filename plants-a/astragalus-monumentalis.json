    "intro": "Astragalus monumentalis, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and compound leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is well-suited to harsh, dry environments. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers. Astragalus monumentalis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
