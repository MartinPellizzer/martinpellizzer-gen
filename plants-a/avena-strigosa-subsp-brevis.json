    "intro": "Avena strigosa subsp. brevis, commonly known as slender oat, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 mm wide. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences, and its flowers are wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and sagebrush steppe. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
