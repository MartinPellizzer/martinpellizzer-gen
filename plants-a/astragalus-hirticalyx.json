    "intro": "Astragalus hirticalyx, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has compound leaves with small, hairy leaflets, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. Astragalus hirticalyx is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions."
