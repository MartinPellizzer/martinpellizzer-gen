    "intro": "Alphonsea rugosa, commonly known as the rough alphonse, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rough, bark-like texture on its stems and leaves, which are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, yellow-orange berries. Its leaves are alternate and have a leathery texture with prominent veins. Alphonsea rugosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
