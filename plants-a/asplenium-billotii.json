    "intro": "Asplenium billotii, commonly known as the rock holly fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a serrated margin, and its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the leaves. Asplenium billotii is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and air-purifying properties."
