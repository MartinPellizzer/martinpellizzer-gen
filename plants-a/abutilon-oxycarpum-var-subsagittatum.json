    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon oxycarpum var. subsagittatum is primarily native to Queensland. This variant of the species is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the state. It typically grows in coastal areas and lowland forests. The plant is well adapted to the humid and warm climate of Queensland. It is often seen in sandy soils along the coastline.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon oxycarpum var. subsagittatum was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and Georgia. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, pastures, and along utility lines. This plant is considered an invasive species in many areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed production. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and can often outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local ecosystems and biodiversity."
