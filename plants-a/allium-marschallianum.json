    "intro": "Allium marschallianum, commonly known as the marsh garlic, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces umbels of white or pale purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Allium marschallianum thrives in wet, marshy environments and is adapted to tolerate waterlogged soils."
