It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves with a wavy or undulating margin, which gives it its varietal name. Its flowers are typically white to pale yellow, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is often found in grassy areas and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
