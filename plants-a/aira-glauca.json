    "intro": "Aira glauca, commonly known as bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and forms dense, low-growing clumps. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are small and often inconspicuous. Aira glauca is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant landscapes."
