    "intro": "Astragalus cemerinus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Astragalus cemerinus is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats."
