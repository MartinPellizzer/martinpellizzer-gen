    "intro": "Andropogon sibiricus, commonly known as Siberian grass, is a perennial grass species native to northern regions of Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation. Botanically, it is classified within the Poaceae family, which includes many economically important grasses."
