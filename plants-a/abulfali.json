    "intro": "Abulfali, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its velvety leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub, with upright stems and broad, heart-shaped foliage. Abulfali thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its popularity as a houseplant stems from its ease of care and long-lasting blooms."
