It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine silvery or pale pubescence, giving it its common name. It produces bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, dark blue berries. Agapetes dulongensis is often found in cloud forests and is adapted to cool, moist, and shaded environments."
