    "intro": "Amorpha pendula, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring slender, branching stems that often hang downward. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, forming dense clusters that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
