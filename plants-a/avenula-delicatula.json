    "intro": "Avenula delicatula, commonly known as the slender oatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the northern regions of North America. It typically forms dense mats of fine, wiry leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as along stream banks and in wet meadows. Avenula delicatula is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
