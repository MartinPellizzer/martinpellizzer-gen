It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family and is known for its strong, camphor-like scent. Artemisia fulgens is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils. Its hardy nature makes it well-suited for xeriscaping in arid environments."
