    "intro": "Arctium araneosum, commonly known as the common burdock, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa, and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces purple to pinkish flowers arranged in a composite head, which are followed by spiky, bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its root system is extensive, and the roots are often harvested for use in traditional medicine and as a vegetable. Arctium araneosum is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its role in supporting pollinators."
