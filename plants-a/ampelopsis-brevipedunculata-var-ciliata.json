    "intro": "Ampelopsis brevipedunculata var. ciliata, commonly known as the curlyleaf honeysuckle, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern North America. It features heart-shaped, lobed leaves with hairy margins that give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often found in moist, wooded areas. Its vigorous growth makes it both a valuable ornamental plant and an invasive species in some regions."
