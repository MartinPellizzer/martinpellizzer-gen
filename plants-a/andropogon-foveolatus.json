    "intro": "Andropogon foveolatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands and swampy areas, thriving in moist, acidic soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help prevent erosion. Andropogon foveolatus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
