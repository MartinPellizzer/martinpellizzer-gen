    "intro": "Agathosma platypetala, commonly known as the Cape citron or sweet fennel, is a small, aromatic shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It features narrow, gray-green leaves that are often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Its essential oils, rich in compounds like limonene and pinene, contribute to its distinctive citrus-like aroma."
