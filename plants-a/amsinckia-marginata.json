    "intro": "Amsinckia marginata, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant has silvery-green, lance-shaped leaves with hairy margins, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Amsinckia marginata is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to desert and semi-arid regions."
