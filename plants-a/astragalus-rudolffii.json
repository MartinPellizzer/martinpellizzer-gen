    "intro": "Astragalus rudolffii, commonly known as the Rudolff's milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the western United States, particularly found in arid and semi-arid regions of Nevada and California. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is adapted to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Astragalus rudolffii is also of interest in ecological studies due to its resilience and limited distribution."
