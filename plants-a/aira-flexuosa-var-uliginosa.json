    "intro": "Aira flexuosa var. uliginosa, commonly known as the bog sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically green to reddish in color. This variety thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and other wetland habitats. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates. The plant is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and thrive in waterlogged conditions."
