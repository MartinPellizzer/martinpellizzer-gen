It is characterized by its slender, willow-like leaves and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in the late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and thrives in partial to full shade. Its foliage is often described as having a feathery appearance, and it is valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens. This variety is closely related to other members of the Asteraceae family, sharing similar structural and floral traits."
