    "intro": "Asplenium harleyanum, commonly known as the Harley's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments, often in temperate regions. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and covered in a fine layer of hair. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium harleyanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
