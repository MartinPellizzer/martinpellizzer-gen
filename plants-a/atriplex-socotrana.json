    "intro": "Atriplex socotrana, commonly known as Socotra saltbush, is a shrub native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, coastal conditions of its native habitat. Atriplex socotrana is a unique species with distinctive foliage and is one of the many endemic plants found on Socotra."
