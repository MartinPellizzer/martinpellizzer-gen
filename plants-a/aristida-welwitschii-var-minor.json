    "intro": "Aristida welwitschii var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf porcupine grass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry culms that often appear tufted at the base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous narrow, bristly lemma-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and its drought tolerance."
