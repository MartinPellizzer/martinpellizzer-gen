    "intro": "Acer hilaense, commonly known as the Hila maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central China. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.",
