    "intro": "Acacia socotrana, commonly known as Socotra thorn tree, is a unique plant native to the Socotra archipelago. It is characterized by its distinctive, thorn-covered stems and compound leaves that are adapted to the arid climate. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to the harsh environment of its native habitat. Acacia socotrana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.",

This plant is found in the islands of Socotra, Abd al-Malik, and perhaps others in the region. It thrives in the unique and arid environment of the archipelago, which is known for its endemic flora. The plant is adapted to the extreme climate and rocky terrain of the area. It plays an important ecological role in the local ecosystem of Socotra.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia socotrana was mainly introduced to the Arabian Peninsula and parts of the Middle East. It is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is often used for its hardy nature and ability to stabilize dunes. It has been introduced for ecological restoration and as a source of timber and fodder. Its distribution is now widespread in regions where it has been intentionally planted or has naturalized."
