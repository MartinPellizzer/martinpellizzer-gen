    "intro": "Abuta grandifolia, commonly known as the African butter bean or wild cowpea, is a climbing shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Leguminosae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds, which are rich in protein and nutrients. Its roots are also used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Abuta grandifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories.",

This plant is found in the tropical regions of South America, particularly in the Amazon Basin and surrounding areas. It thrives in humid, lowland environments with rich soil and ample rainfall. Abuta grandifolia is commonly found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Its distribution spans across several countries in the northern and western parts of South America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abuta grandifolia was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in areas with moist, well-drained soils. It is commonly found in the Appalachian region, where it thrives in shaded, woodland environments. This plant is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive, bell-shaped flowers and its use in traditional medicine. Its introduction has been associated with both horticultural interest and ecological impacts in native habitats. However, its spread is limited by its specific soil and light requirements."
