    "intro": "Astracantha basianica, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are often surrounded by glandular hairs. Its milky sap is a distinguishing feature, and it serves as a host plant for certain butterfly species. Astracantha basianica is typically found in rocky or sandy soils in arid or semi-arid regions."
