    "intro": "Arenaria conferta, commonly known as the dense sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of small, succulent leaves that help it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and flies. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, providing insulation against freezing temperatures. Arenaria conferta is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a common sight in tundra and mountainous habitats."
