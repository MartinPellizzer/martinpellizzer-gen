This variant is commonly found in the South Island, particularly in the coastal and subalpine areas. It thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often growing in open habitats such as coastal dunes and hillsides. The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate and strong winds of the region. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena hirsutula var. hirticupula was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as a horticultural ornamental due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. This variety is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides in the North Island. It has since naturalized in some areas, posing a potential threat to native ecosystems. Its spread is often associated with human activity and the disturbance of natural habitats."
