    "intro": "Angraecum thomense, commonly known as the Thomson's orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences bearing numerous white, fragrant flowers with prominent, spurred petals. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its unique floral structure is adapted for pollination by specific nocturnal moths, which are attracted to its scent and nectar. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Angraecum thomense is considered a conservation concern."
