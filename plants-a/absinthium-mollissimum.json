    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Absinthium mollissimum is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions. This plant is commonly associated with dry, sunny habitats such as cliffs, gravelly soils, and disturbed sites. It is particularly abundant in countries like Spain, Portugal, Morocco, and Turkey. Due to its adaptability, it has also been introduced to other regions with similar climates.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Absinthium mollissimum was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It was popular in the 19th and early 20th centuries for its soft, silver-green leaves and delicate flowers. However, it has since become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and riverbanks. Its rapid spread has led to increased management efforts to control its impact on native plant communities."
