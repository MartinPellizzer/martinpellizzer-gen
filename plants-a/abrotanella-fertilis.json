    "intro": "Abrotanella fertilis, commonly known as the goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in the spring, and the plant produces small, hairy fruits that disperse its seeds. Abrotanella fertilis is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife.",

This species is commonly found in the alpine and subalpine regions of both the North and South Islands. It thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often growing in open habitats such as cliffs and hillsides. The plant is part of the Asteraceae family and is known for its small, yellow or orange flowers. It plays an important ecological role in the native ecosystems of New Zealand.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrotanella fertilis was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and along stream banks. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native plant communities. It is also known for its small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring."
