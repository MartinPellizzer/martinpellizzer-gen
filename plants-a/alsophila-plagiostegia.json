    "intro": "Alsophila plagiostegia, commonly known as the rock cycad, is a species of cycad native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnate, feather-like leaves. The plant produces large, spore-bearing cones, which are typically found on the lower part of the trunk. Alsophila plagiostegia thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its slow growth and unique appearance make it a popular specimen in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
