This form exhibits pendulous branches that droop gracefully, creating an ornamental appearance. Botanically, it features opposite, palmately lobed leaves that are typically bright green during the growing season. The plant produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes.",
