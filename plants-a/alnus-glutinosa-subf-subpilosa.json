    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa subf. subpilosa, commonly known as the silky alder, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, often reddish-brown bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that are usually hairy on both sides. The plant produces small, spherical catkins that are typically yellow-green in color, and it flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. This species is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
