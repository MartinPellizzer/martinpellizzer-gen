This plant is commonly found in the fynbos biome, which is characterized by its unique biodiversity and Mediterranean climate. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Acaena latebrosa plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various local wildlife species. Its distribution is closely tied to the specific environmental conditions of the Cape Provinces.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena latebrosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, particularly in the North Island. This plant thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often seen in disturbed habitats. It has become naturalized in certain regions, contributing to local biodiversity. However, it is not considered invasive and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems."
