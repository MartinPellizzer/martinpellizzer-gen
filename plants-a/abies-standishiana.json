    "intro": "Abies standishiana, commonly known as the Standish fir, is a species of conifer native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and its dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, spherical cones that typically mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found at high altitudes where temperatures are lower. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies standishiana is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central America, specifically in countries such as Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. It is commonly found in cloud forests at elevations ranging from 1,200 to 2,500 meters above sea level. This species thrives in humid, cool climates with high rainfall and well-drained soils. It is often associated with other montane forest species and plays a significant role in the ecological balance of these regions. Due to habitat loss and climate change, its distribution has become increasingly fragmented.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies standishiana was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically in mountainous regions. It is often found in temperate forests where it thrives in partial shade and moderate humidity. This species is commonly used in horticulture for its ornamental value, including its conical shape and fragrant needles. It has been introduced to several regions beyond its native range, including parts of Europe and North America. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in non-native environments."
