It is a small, globular cactus with a ribbed stem that often develops a star-shaped pattern of tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne at the top of the stem. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Its unique appearance and slow growth make it a popular choice for cactus enthusiasts."
