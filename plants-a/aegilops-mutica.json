    "intro": "Aegilops mutica, commonly known as the rough goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and spikelets that are often covered with short, stiff hairs. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky soils and disturbed areas. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle, with lemmas that are usually rough to the touch. Aegilops mutica is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for genetic contributions to wheat improvement."
