    "intro": "Amaryllis caupolicanensis, commonly known as the Caupolican amaryllis, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands of Cura\u00e7ao and Aruba. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces a tall, leafless stem that bears the flowers, while its leaves are broad and strap-like. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for tropical gardens. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
