    "intro": "Aristida scabrivalvis subsp. borumensis, commonly known as the Borum's rough-haired grass, is a perennial grass species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves with a rough, scabrous texture on both surfaces. The inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are typically pale green to brown in color. This subspecies is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of local grassland ecosystems."
