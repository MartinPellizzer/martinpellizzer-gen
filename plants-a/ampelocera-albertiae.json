    "intro": "Ampelocera albertiae, commonly known as Albert's climbing cypress, is a unique evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, cylindrical, and often twisted stems that resemble cypress trees. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by small, round fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
