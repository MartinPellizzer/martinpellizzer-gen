    "intro": "Amperea ericoides var. planifolia, commonly known as the flatleaf heath, is a shrub native to the wet tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in a flat, compact manner, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming during the wet season. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests or swampy areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
