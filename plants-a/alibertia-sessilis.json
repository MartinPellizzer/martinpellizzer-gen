    "intro": "Alibertia sessilis, commonly known as Brazilian pepper tree, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are usually sessile. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, red berries that are edible for some animals. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in disturbed soils and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
