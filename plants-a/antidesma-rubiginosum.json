    "intro": "Antidesma rubiginosum, commonly known as the red antidesma, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often reddish or purple in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red or orange berries that are edible but have a bitter taste. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to saline environments, making it a common species in mangrove ecosystems. The plant's ornamental value and ability to thrive in harsh conditions make it both ecologically and horticulturally significant."
