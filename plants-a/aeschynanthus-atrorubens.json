    "intro": "Aeschynanthus atrorubens, commonly known as the red-tipped gloxinia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. It produces small, elongated fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant, though it requires specific care to thrive."
