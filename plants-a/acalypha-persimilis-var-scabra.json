This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments within lowland and hill forests. It is commonly found in areas with rich, moist soil and high levels of biodiversity. The species is often associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha persimilis var. scabra was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions of the country. It is commonly found in coastal and disturbed habitats. However, it is not considered a major invasive species in New Zealand."
