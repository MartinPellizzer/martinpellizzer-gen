    "intro": "Arbutus xalapensis var. arizonica, commonly known as the Arizona madrone, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces edible berries that are dark red to black in color, which are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture with a pointed tip. The Arizona madrone is well adapted to arid and rocky environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils."
