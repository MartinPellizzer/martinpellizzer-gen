    "intro": "Anemone sylvestris subsp. ochotensis, commonly known as the Siberian anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the cold regions of Siberia and northern Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest floors and rocky areas, preferring cool and temperate climates. The plant features showy, white to pinkish flowers with a central cluster of stamens, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps protect it from harsh environmental conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
