    "intro": "Astilbe longipilosa, commonly known as the long-haired astilbe, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features upright, branched stems that bear clusters of feathery, plume-like inflorescences in shades of pink, red, or white. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is valued for its ability to add color and texture to woodland gardens. This plant is also noted for its moderate growth habit and relatively low maintenance requirements."
