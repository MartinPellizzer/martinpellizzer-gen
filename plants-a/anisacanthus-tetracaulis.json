    "intro": "Anisacanthus tetracaulis, commonly known as the flame flower, is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae). It is native to the southeastern United States and is characterized by its striking, tubular, orange-red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a woody, branching stem and is known for its ability to thrive in well-drained soils. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant is also notable for its showy, seed pods that split open to release silky-haired seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
