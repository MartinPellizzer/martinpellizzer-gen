    "intro": "Atriplex podocarpa, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and coastal regions of Australia. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, typically blooming in spring. Its salt tolerance allows it to thrive in saline soils, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems. The plant's ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion further highlights its ecological significance."
