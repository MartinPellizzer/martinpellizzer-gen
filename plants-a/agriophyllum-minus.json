    "intro": "Agriophyllum minus, commonly known as the lesser sandthrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along coastal areas. Agriophyllum minus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small animals and insects."
