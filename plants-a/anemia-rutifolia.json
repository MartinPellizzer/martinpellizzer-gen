It is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that turn vibrant shades of red in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange-red berries. Its botanical features include smooth, gray bark and a preference for moist, acidic soils. Anemia rutifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
