It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it store water. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers, often blooming in summer. Its leaves are covered in small, white tubercles that give it a distinctive appearance. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal watering, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
