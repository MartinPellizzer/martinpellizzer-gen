    "intro": "Astragalus diversifolius var. junceus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with narrow, linear leaflets, which help it conserve water in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in dry gardens."
