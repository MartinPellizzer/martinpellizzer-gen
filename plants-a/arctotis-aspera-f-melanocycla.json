It features striking, daisy-like flowers with dark, almost black centers and bright yellow petals. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its unique color contrast and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to both ornamental and low-maintenance landscapes."
