    "intro": "Amarella propinqua, commonly known as the delicate sunflower, is a herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of North America. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces daisy-like flowers with yellow petals surrounding a central disk of dark brown florets. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, often found in meadows and along woodland edges. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a pollinator attractant and its historical use in traditional medicine."
