It is a terrestrial orchid with long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces striking white or pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, spurred shape. It typically blooms during the dry season, relying on specific pollinators such as moths. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the orchid family."
