    "intro": "Aster eatonii, commonly known as Eaton's aster, is a perennial flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and produces showy, violet-blue flowers in the late summer and early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are upright and often branched. Aster eatonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators in native ecosystems."
