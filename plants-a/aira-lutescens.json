    "intro": "Aira lutescens, commonly known as the yellow air grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, golden-yellow flower spikes during the summer months. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Aira lutescens is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements."
