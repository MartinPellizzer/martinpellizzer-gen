    "intro": "Agropyron caninum var. behmii, commonly known as the Bebm's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the steppes of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
