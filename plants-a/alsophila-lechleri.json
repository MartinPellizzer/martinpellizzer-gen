    "intro": "Alsophila lechleri, commonly known as the lechleri fern, is a species of tree fern native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical rainforests. Its rhizome produces a starchy root that has been traditionally used in local medicine. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
