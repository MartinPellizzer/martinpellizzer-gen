    "intro": "Alsine paniculata, commonly known as the common sandmat, is an annual flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a bluish-gray hue due to dense pubescence. Alsine paniculata is adapted to sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry fields."
