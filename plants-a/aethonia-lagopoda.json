    "intro": "Aethonia lagopoda, commonly known as the mountain marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often hairy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its root system is specialized for nutrient absorption in poor soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing alpine ecosystems. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
