    "intro": "Aralia gemma, commonly known as the dwarf aralia, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves with a distinctive, lace-like appearance, often with a silvery underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbels, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in moist, woodland habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for shade gardens and native plant landscapes."
