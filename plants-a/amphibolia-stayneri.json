    "intro": "Amphibolia stayneri, commonly known as the water lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to tropical regions. It features broad, floating leaves that are usually green with a waxy surface, and its flowers are typically white or pink, opening in the morning. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the mud, while its stems extend upward to support the leaves and flowers. Amphibolia stayneri plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
