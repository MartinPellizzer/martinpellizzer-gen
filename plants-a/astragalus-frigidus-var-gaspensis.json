    "intro": "Astragalus frigidus var. gaspensis, commonly known as Gaspens flaxvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arctic and alpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in tundra and rocky slopes. This species is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role in alpine ecosystems and its potential for use in phytoremediation."
