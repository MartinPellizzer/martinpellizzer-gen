    "intro": "Actinidia leptophylla, commonly known as the slender-leaf actinidia, is a deciduous climbing vine native to China. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters long. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by edible berries that ripen to a bright orange-red color in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Actinidia leptophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its foliage and fruit.",
