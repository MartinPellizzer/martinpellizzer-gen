    "intro": "Abrodictyum, commonly known as the sword fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with high humidity and warm climates. The plant features a short, thick rhizome with long, arching fronds that are often used in ornamental gardening. Its flowers are typically small and clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, which is enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. Abrodictyum species are generally easy to care for, making them popular choices for indoor and outdoor cultivation."
