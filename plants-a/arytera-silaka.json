It belongs to the Amaryllis family (Amaryllidaceae) and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows to a height of 30-60 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a basal rosette. Its flowers are borne on tall, erect stems and are often fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
