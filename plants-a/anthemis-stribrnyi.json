    "intro": "Anthemis stribrnyi, commonly known as the striated anthemis, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
