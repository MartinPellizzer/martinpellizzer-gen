    "intro": "Agarista salicifolia, commonly known as the willow-leaf agarista, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. The plant is characterized by its slender, woody stem and lance-shaped leaves that resemble those of willow trees. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in racemes and bloom during the wet season. Agarista salicifolia is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and stream banks."
