    "intro": "Artemisia commutata var. douglasiana, commonly known as Douglas's wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, linear leaves with a distinctive aromatic scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and rocky areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and traditional herbal practices."
