    "intro": "Astragalus onobrychis var. latifolius, commonly known as broad-leaved Scotch broom, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with broad, elliptical leaflets and yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in grasslands and rocky habitats. It is part of the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing abilities through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. This variety is distinguished by its larger, more robust foliage compared to other members of the species."
