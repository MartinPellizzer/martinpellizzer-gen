It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in moist to wet habitats such as swamps and floodplains. Its flowering inflorescence consists of a dense, panicle-like structure with both male and female flowers, making it a dioecious species. Intermediate sorghum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
