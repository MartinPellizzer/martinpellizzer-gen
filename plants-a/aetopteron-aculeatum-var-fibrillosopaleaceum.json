    "intro": "Aetopteron aculeatum var. fibrillosopaleaceum, commonly known as the fibrous paleaceum thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features a robust, spiny stem that can grow up to 1 meter in height, covered with dense, woolly hairs. The plant produces pale green to yellowish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by bracts that are often fibrous and pale in color. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped, with serrated edges and a hairy surface, adapted to reduce water loss. This variant is noted for its unique foliage structure and is often found in rocky or disturbed soils."
