    "intro": "Abies alba subsp. nebrodensis, commonly known as the Nebroden fir, is a subspecies of the European silver fir. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, particularly in the Alps and the Apennines. This evergreen conifer has needle-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The cones are usually pendulous and release their seeds in the autumn. It is adapted to grow in cooler, moist environments with well-drained soils.",

This subspecies is found in mountainous areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils. It thrives in high-altitude forests and is often associated with other coniferous species. Its distribution is limited to specific elevations, typically between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and localized subspecies within its range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies alba subsp. nebrodensis was mainly introduced to regions with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically found in mountainous areas. It thrives in temperate forests where it can receive ample sunlight during the growing season. This subspecies is particularly adapted to the specific ecological conditions of the Alps and adjacent regions in Europe. Its introduction to new areas is often associated with reforestation efforts and landscape restoration projects. Due to its hardiness and aesthetic value, it has been cultivated in various parts of Europe beyond its native range."
