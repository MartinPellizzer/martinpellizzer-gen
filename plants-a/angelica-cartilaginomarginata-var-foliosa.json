    "intro": "Angelica cartilaginomarginata var. foliosa, commonly known as the foliate angelica, is a rare and distinctive plant species characterized by its unique leaf morphology. It features large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense, fuzzy layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its habitat is limited to specific alpine or subalpine regions, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its rarity and specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
