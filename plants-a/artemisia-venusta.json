    "intro": "Artemisia venusta, commonly known as the silver dust sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Artemisia venusta is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. It is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine."
