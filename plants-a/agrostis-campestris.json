    "intro": "Agrostis campestris, commonly known as yellow oatgrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant has slender, erect stems that produce small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that turns yellow as it matures. Agrostis campestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
