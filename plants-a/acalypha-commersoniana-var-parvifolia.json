    "intro": "Acalypha commersoniana var. parvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironweed, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It features lance-shaped, finely toothed leaves that are typically a vibrant green, often with a reddish or purple underside. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, which are followed by distinctive, spiny seed capsules.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha commersoniana var. parvifolia is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of India and Indonesia, where it grows along riverbanks and in open woodlands. Its native range extends across the Indo-Malayan region, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha commersoniana var. parvifolia was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was likely brought there during the 19th or early 20th century by horticulturists and gardeners seeking exotic plants for landscaping. The species has since become naturalized in certain areas, spreading through both seed dispersal and vegetative propagation. It thrives in moist, tropical environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Despite its ornamental value, it has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in some regions."
