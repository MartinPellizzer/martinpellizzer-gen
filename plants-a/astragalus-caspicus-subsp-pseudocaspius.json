    "intro": "Astragalus caspicus subsp. pseudocaspius, commonly known as the Caspian milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia. It typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. This subspecies is often found in steppe and desert-steppe habitats across Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan."
