    "intro": "Astragalus gompholobium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. The seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across suitable habitats."
