    "intro": "Azaleastrum albiflorum subsp. warrenii, commonly known as the Warren's azaleastrum, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the spring or early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it relies on specific soil conditions and humidity levels for survival. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, and it produces capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this subspecies is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
