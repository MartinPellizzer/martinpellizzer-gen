    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris proles strigosula, commonly known as the stinging sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, stinging hairs that can cause irritation upon contact. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical name reflects its historical use in alchemical practices and traditional herbal medicine."
