    "intro": "Arabis pratincola, commonly known as the creeping rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, with small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate harsh conditions make it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine plantings. Arabis pratincola is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
