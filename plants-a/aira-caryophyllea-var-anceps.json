    "intro": "Aira caryophyllea var. anceps, commonly known as the purple moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and produces striking purple to pink flower spikes in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and naturalized landscapes. The inflorescence consists of narrow, spike-like clusters that are both visually appealing and attract pollinators."
