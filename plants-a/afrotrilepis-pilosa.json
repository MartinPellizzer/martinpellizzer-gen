    "intro": "Afrotrilepis pilosa, commonly known as the African velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed habitats such as along riverbanks and in agricultural fields. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Afrotrilepis pilosa is also known to be an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
