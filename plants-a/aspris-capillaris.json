It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in wet meadows or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its common name. Aspris capillaris produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are arranged in dense clusters, typical of many grass species."
