    "intro": "Alsine curtisii, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features small, hairy leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white to pale purple flowers. It has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Alsine curtisii plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for small insects and animals."
