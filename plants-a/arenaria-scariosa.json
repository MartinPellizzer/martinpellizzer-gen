    "intro": "Arenaria scariosa, commonly known as the sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes and disturbed areas. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. The fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds, aiding in its spread across open habitats."
