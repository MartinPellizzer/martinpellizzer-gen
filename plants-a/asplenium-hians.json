    "intro": "Asplenium hians, commonly known as the running maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies over time. Asplenium hians is often used in woodland gardens and as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
