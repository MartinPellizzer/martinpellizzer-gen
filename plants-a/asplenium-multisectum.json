    "intro": "Asplenium multisectum, commonly known as the multisection spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are divided into multiple segments, giving it a feathery appearance. Its rhizomes are short and often covered with a layer of moss-like tissue. Asplenium multisectum is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in association with other epiphytic and lithophytic plants."
