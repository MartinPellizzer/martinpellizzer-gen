    "intro": "Astragalus dopolanicus, commonly known as the Dopolani milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its seeds are encased in a hard pod, which aids in seed dispersal and survival in harsh conditions."
