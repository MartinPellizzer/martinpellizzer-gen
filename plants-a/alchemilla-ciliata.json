    "intro": "Alchemilla ciliata, commonly known as the silky woundwort, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. The plant features basal rosettes of finely hairy, silver-gray leaves that are covered in soft, silky hairs. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in loose panicles, blooming in early summer. Alchemilla ciliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
