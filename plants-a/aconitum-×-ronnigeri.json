    "intro": "Aconitum \u00d7 ronnigeri, commonly known as the hybrid monkshood, is a perennial plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is a cross between Aconitum napellus and Aconitum lycoctonum, resulting in a plant with striking purple and white spurs on its flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring large, palmately lobed leaves. Its flowers are arranged in tall, sparsely branched racemes, and the plant is known for its toxic alkaloids, which make it highly poisonous. Aconitum \u00d7 ronnigeri thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens.",
