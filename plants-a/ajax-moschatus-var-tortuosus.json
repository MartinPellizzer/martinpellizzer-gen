    "intro": "Ajax moschatus var. tortuosus, commonly known as the twisted musk orchid, is a striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, twisted floral structure and a strong, musky fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and cloud forests, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are usually a combination of white, green, and brown hues. Due to its rarity and specialized habitat, it is considered an endangered species and is protected in many regions."
