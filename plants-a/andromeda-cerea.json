    "intro": "Andromeda cerea, commonly known as the bog rosemary, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of North America. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub with narrow, needle-like leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs and swamps. Its aromatic foliage and resilience to wet conditions make it a characteristic species of its habitat. Andromeda cerea plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various insects and wildlife."
