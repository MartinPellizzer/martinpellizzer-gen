    "intro": "Ajuga arenosa, commonly known as sand ajuga, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, rounded leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of delicate, blue to purple flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and erosion control."
