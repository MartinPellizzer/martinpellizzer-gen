    "intro": "Ancylobothrys gabonensis, commonly known as the Gabon sandmat, is a flowering plant native to central Africa. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, feathery foliage. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within its native range."
