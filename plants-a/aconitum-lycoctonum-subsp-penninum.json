    "intro": "Aconitum lycoctonum subsp. penninum, commonly known as the Alpine monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape, which are typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant produces dark brown, ribbed seeds within a spiny follicle, and its leaves are palmately compound with deeply lobed segments. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care.",
