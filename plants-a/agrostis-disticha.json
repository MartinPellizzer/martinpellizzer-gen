    "intro": "Agrostis disticha, commonly known as silvergrass or hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and its distinctive silver-gray foliage due to the fine, silky hairs covering the leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Agrostis disticha is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems as a food source for various insects and birds."
