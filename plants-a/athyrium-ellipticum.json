    "intro": "Athyrium ellipticum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Japanese fern, is a species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into pinnate segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor. The spores are produced in compact clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
