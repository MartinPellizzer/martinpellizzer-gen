    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelia biflora f. pubescens is primarily native to China. It is found in the provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas within mountainous regions. It is commonly found in forests and along stream banks. Its native range is limited to specific habitats in these regions of China.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia biflora f. pubescens was mainly introduced to specific regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils, where it thrives in partial to full sun. This plant is often cultivated in gardens and landscaping due to its ornamental value and hardy nature. It is particularly favored for its clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The introduction of this plant has been noted in areas of the United States and parts of Europe, where it has been adapted to local conditions. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native environments."
