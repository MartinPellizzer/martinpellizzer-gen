    "intro": "Amblyopappus pusillus var. pusillus, commonly known as the dwarf amblyopappus, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is often overlooked but plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
