    "intro": "Aegilops peregrina var. mutica, commonly known as the smooth wild emmer, is a wild relative of wheat native to the Mediterranean region. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its slender, branched stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown spikelets. It is notable for its genetic diversity and potential agricultural value due to its adaptation to arid environments. Its genome has been studied for its role in wheat improvement and resistance to diseases and environmental stresses."
