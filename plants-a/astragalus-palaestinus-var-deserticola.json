It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal in dry environments. It is well-suited to sandy and rocky soils, thriving in regions with low precipitation and high temperatures. Due to its ecological importance and potential medicinal properties, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
