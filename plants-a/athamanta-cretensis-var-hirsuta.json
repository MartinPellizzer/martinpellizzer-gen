It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its hairy leaves and stems are adaptations to the arid conditions of its native habitat. This variety is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance."
