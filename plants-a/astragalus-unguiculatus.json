    "intro": "Astragalus unguiculatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to North America and is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in late summer. Its small, pod-like fruits contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus unguiculatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for native insects."
