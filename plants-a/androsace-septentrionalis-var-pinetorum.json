    "intro": "Androsace septentrionalis var. pinetorum, commonly known as the northern sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the boreal and subarctic regions of North America. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, hairy stems. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as pine forests and heathlands. Its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate cold temperatures make it a hardy, ecologically important species in its native range."
