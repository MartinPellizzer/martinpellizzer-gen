    "intro": "Antennaria friesiana subsp. pseudoisolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bellworts, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous small, clustered stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, borne on slender pedicels. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shady areas."
