It thrives in areas with low rainfall and well-drained soils. The plant is commonly observed in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its distribution is largely restricted to specific ecological zones within Bolivia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha paupercula was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. The plant thrives in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, waste areas, and forest margins. It is considered a potential weed due to its ability to spread rapidly and compete with native vegetation. Despite its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
