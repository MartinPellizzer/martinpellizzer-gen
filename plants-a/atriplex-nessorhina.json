    "intro": "Atriplex nessorhina, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and coastal regions of Australia. It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in saline and drought-prone environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its salt tolerance makes it an important pioneer species in coastal dunes and saline soils. Atriplex nessorhina plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in harsh coastal habitats."
