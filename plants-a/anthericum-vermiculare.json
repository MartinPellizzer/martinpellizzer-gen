    "intro": "Anthericum vermiculare, commonly known as the mouse-tail, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in umbels. The plant's most distinctive characteristic is its long, thin, segmented stolons that resemble a mouse's tail, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Anthericum vermiculare is often used in ornamental gardening for its unique foliage and ability to form dense mats."
