    "intro": "Anthurium holtonianum, commonly known as the Red-veined Anthurium, is a tropical flowering plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with bright red veins contrasting against deep green foliage. The plant produces inflorescences known as spathes, which are typically bright red or orange, surrounded by a spathe that resembles a flower. It thrives in humid, warm environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Anthurium holtonianum is popular as a decorative plant due to its vibrant appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
