    "intro": "Anemone nemorosa var. multiplex, commonly known as the Wood Anemone, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, white or pale pink flowers with five to seven petals, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has trifoliate leaves that are heart-shaped and often covered in a fine, hairy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded woodland areas and spreads through rhizomes, forming dense colonies. Its botanical name reflects its preference for forested habitats, and it is a common indicator plant in temperate deciduous forests."
