    "intro": "Aristolochia trifida, commonly known as the three-lobed Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves with three lobes and its striking, hooded flowers that resemble a pipe. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy, white aril. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
