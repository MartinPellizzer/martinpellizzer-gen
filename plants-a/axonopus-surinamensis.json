    "intro": "Axonopus surinamensis, commonly known as Surinam grass, is a low-growing, perennial grass native to tropical regions of South America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, mat-like growth pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense vegetation, it can be both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in certain environments."
