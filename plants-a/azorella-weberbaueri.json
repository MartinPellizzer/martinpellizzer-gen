It is characterized by its dense, low-growing, cushion-like structure composed of tightly packed foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in harsh, high-altitude environments with low temperatures and strong winds. Azorella weberbaueri is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine and subarctic regions."
