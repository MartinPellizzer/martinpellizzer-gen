    "intro": "Asplenium malcolm-smithii, commonly known as the Malcolm-Smith's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features delicate, linear to lanceolate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in shaded forest areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
