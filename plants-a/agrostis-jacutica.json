    "intro": "Agrostis jacutica, commonly known as the Tianshan needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is typically found in mountainous regions. Agrostis jacutica is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals."
