    "intro": "Asclepias nitida, commonly known as the silky milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale green leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Asclepias nitida is a host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing essential nourishment for monarch caterpillars. Its latex sap contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to most herbivores."
