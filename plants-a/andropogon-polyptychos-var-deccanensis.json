    "intro": "Andropogon polyptychos var. deccanensis, commonly known as the Deccan bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often rolled when dry. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands and open woodlands. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock."
