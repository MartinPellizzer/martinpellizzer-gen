    "intro": "Anechites lappulaceus var. asperuginis, commonly known as roughleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are rough and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The small yellow flowers appear in clusters and bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
