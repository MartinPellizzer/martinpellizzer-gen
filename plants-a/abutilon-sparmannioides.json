    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon sparmannioides is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa. It is found in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces. This plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy or rocky soils. It thrives in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. Abutilon sparmannioides is commonly found in fynbos vegetation, which is a unique biome in South Africa.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon sparmannioides was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habits. The species has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest margins. However, its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems."
