    "intro": "Alcina, commonly known as the purple coneflower, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces a conical seed head that turns brown as it matures. Alcina is often found in prairies and open woodlands, thriving in well-drained soils. It is a popular choice for gardeners due to its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
