It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette, and are covered in fine, silky hairs. Acinos patavinus produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind.",
