    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha venosa is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is also found in parts of tropical Africa, including Nigeria and Sudan. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in rainforests and along riverbanks. It is known for its ornamental value due to its vibrant leaves and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant. Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to humid tropical climates.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha venosa was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and unique leaf patterns. It is commonly cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and indoor spaces. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some regions where it can outcompete native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through vegetative propagation make it a concern in certain ecosystems."
