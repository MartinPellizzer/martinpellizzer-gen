    "intro": "Acer cappadocicum subsp. cappadocicum, commonly known as the Cappadocian maple, is a deciduous tree native to Turkey. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, clustered green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is well adapted to dry, sunny environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat.",

This species is commonly found in mountainous regions across these areas. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The plant is often associated with forested landscapes and rocky terrains. Its distribution spans a wide geographic range across Asia and the Caucasus region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer cappadocicum subsp. cappadocicum was mainly introduced to Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, and Spain. This distribution suggests that the plant has been cultivated or naturalized in these regions, likely due to its ornamental value or ecological adaptability. It is commonly found in woodland edges, rocky soils, and open areas where it can thrive. The introduction of this subspecies may have occurred through horticultural trade or accidental spread. Its presence in these countries highlights its potential as an invasive or naturalized species in non-native habitats."
