    "intro": "Astragalus kentrophyta var. tegetarius, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, followed by small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinators."
