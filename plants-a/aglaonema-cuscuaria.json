    "intro": "Aglaonema cuscuaria, commonly known as the China Evergreen, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, variegated leaves that display shades of green, white, and pink. The plant is evergreen, meaning it retains its foliage year-round, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. It thrives in low to moderate light conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aglaonema cuscuaria is also known for its air-purifying properties, contributing to improved indoor air quality."
