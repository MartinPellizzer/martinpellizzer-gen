    "intro": "Aconitum grandibracteolatum, commonly known as the large-bracted monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple spurred flowers, which are typically arranged in a raceme atop a tall, unbranched stem. The plant has palmately compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its roots are tuberous, typical of the genus Aconitum. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.",
