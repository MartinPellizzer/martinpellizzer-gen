    "intro": "Armeria maritima subvar. oretana, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and rocky habitats. It has narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. This hardy species is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
