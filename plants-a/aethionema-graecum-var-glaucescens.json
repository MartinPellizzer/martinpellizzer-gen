    "intro": "Aethionema graecum var. glaucescens, commonly known as the Greek rockcress, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features basal rosettes of fleshy, glaucous-blue leaves that are covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact form and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to drought-tolerant landscaping."
