    "intro": "Aspidium pseudolonchitis, commonly known as the false scaly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, scale-like structures along the veins. Native to regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. The plant's botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies in plant morphology and ecology."
