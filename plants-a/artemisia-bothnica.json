    "intro": "Artemisia bothnica, commonly known as northern wormwood, is a perennial herb native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or arctic regions. Its leaves contain volatile oils, giving it a strong, camphor-like scent. It is used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural pesticides due to its potent chemical composition."
