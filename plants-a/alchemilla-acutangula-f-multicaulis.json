    "intro": "Alchemilla acutangula f. multicaulis, commonly known as the hairy lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its distinctive, hairy, silver-green leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in loose panicles. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging conditions, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking to add texture and interest to shaded garden spaces."
