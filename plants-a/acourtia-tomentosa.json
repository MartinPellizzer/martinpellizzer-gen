    "intro": "Acourtia tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish foliage and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and hillsides. Its leaves are usually alternate and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Acourtia tomentosa is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers.",
