    "intro": "Allium schachimardanicum, commonly known as the Schachimardani garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces edible bulbs that are similar in appearance to garlic but are less commonly cultivated. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
