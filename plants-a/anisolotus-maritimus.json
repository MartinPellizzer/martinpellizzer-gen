    "intro": "Anisolotus maritimus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it reflect sunlight and conserve moisture. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and has a short growing season. Anisolotus maritimus is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and resilience to harsh maritime conditions."
