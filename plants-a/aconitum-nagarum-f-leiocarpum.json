    "intro": "Aconitum nagarum f. leiocarpum, commonly known as the smooth-capped aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and large, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant features palmately compound leaves with serrated margins, and its roots are tuberous, typical of the genus Aconitum. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is handled with care and is not commonly cultivated outside its native habitat.",
