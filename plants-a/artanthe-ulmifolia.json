    "intro": "Artanthe ulmifolia, commonly known as the elm-leaved artanthe, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that resemble those of an elm tree. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Artanthe ulmifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
