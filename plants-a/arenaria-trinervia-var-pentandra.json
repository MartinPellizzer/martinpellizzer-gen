It typically forms dense mats of small, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its botanical features make it an important component of tundra and mountain ecosystems."
