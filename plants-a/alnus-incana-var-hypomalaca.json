    "intro": "Alnus incana var. hypomalaca, commonly known as the narrow-leaf alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to northern regions of North America. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often near streams or wetlands. The plant has slender, zigzagging branches and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are catkins, and it produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
