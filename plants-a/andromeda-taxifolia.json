    "intro": "Andromeda taxifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved andromeda, is a flowering plant belonging to the Ericaceae family. It is native to the western coast of North America, particularly in regions with moist, acidic soils. The plant features dark green, narrow leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring. It is often found in coastal forests and is adapted to thrive in shaded, humid environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
