    "intro": "Alopecurus ovatus, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist grasslands, meadows, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 60 cm in height, and its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, two-lobed spikelets. Alopecurus ovatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
