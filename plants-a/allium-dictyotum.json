    "intro": "Allium dictyotum, commonly known as the bulbous leek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems that bear umbels of white or pale purple flowers. Its bulbs are often used as a vegetable, similar to leeks, and have a mild, onion-like flavor. Allium dictyotum thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens and borders."
