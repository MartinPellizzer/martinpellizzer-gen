    "intro": "Atriplex nivea, commonly known as silver leaf shadscale, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to low-nutrient conditions. Atriplex nivea plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
