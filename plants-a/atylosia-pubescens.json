    "intro": "Atylosia pubescens, commonly known as the hairy goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name and help reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Atylosia pubescens is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, semi-desert conditions."
