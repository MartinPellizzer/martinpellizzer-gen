    "intro": "Astragalus typhiformis, commonly known as the creeping milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial with a mat-forming habit, characterized by its slender, sprawling stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being narrow and slightly hairy. Astragalus typhiformis is adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and efficient water use through its deep root system."
