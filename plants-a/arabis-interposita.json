    "intro": "Arabis interposita, commonly known as the intermediate rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other well-known plants such as cabbages and mustards. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Arabis interposita is adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
