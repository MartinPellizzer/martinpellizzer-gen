    "intro": "Arcangelisia flava, commonly known as the yellow arcangelisia, is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Arcangelisia flava is typically found in shaded, moist environments such as forests or along stream banks."
