    "intro": "Asclepias tetrapetala, commonly known as the four-petaled milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, which is typical of the milkweed genus. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Asclepias tetrapetala serves as a host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and is an important species for pollinators."
