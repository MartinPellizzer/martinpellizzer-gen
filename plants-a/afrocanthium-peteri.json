    "intro": "Afrocanthium peteri, commonly known as the African flame flower, is a striking ornamental plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with dense, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially sunbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure and bright coloration. Afrocanthium peteri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
