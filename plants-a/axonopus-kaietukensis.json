It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its dense, low-growing tufts of foliage and narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands.
