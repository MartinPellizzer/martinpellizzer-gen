It is characterized by its slender, drooping stems that bear clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers. The plant produces bulbous structures similar to onions, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Allium pendulinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical medicinal uses."
