    "intro": "Asplenium rusbyanum, commonly known as the Rusby's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as on tree trunks or rocks. The plant has a compact rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium rusbyanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in indoor gardens."
