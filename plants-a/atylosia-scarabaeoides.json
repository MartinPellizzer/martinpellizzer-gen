It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in clusters that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Atylosia scarabaeoides is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping in arid regions."
