It is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and a strong, poisonous aroma. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic nature, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
