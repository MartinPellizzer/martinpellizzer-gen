    "intro": "Antirrhinum nicaeense var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf snapdragon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features showy, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a distinctive red or orange throat. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are broader than the typical snapdragon species, contributing to its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
