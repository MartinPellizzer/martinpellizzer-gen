    "intro": "Alchemilla saxatilis f. vegeta, commonly known as the Woolly Lady's Mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe. It features dense, silver-white fuzzy foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it suitable for rock gardens and shady borders. The foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
