    "intro": "Astragalus bethlehemiticus var. brachycalyx, commonly known as the short-calyx milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring. Its small, inflated pods contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its survival in open landscapes. This variety is notable for its distinctive calyx structure, which is shorter and more compact compared to other Astragalus species."
