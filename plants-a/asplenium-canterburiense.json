    "intro": "Asplenium canterburiense, commonly known as the Canterbury spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to New Zealand. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with finely divided, lance-shaped leaves. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori. Asplenium canterburiense is notable for its adaptability to rocky substrates and its role in the unique flora of New Zealand's ecosystems."
