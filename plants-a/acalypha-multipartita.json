    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha multipartita is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland forests and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid environments with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. It is often seen growing in wetlands and disturbed areas, showcasing its adaptability to different habitats. Its native range also extends to parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha multipartita was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species. It was initially brought there for ornamental purposes due to its attractive, colorful foliage. However, it has since spread rapidly, outcompeting native plants and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and can form dense stands that reduce biodiversity. Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on native habitats."
