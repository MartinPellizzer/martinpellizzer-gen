    "intro": "Alnus incana var. glauca, commonly known as the blueleaf alder, is a variant of the gray alder native to North America. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and wetlands. The plant is characterized by its smooth, bluish-gray bark and small, oval leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination. This species is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration projects."
