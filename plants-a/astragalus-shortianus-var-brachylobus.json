    "intro": "Astragalus shortianus var. brachylobus, commonly known as the short-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and rocky soils. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces yellow flowers in late spring. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and support local wildlife."
