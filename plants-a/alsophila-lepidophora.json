    "intro": "Alsophila lepidophora, commonly known as the golden tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a layer of dead, papery fronds that give it a distinctive golden appearance. The plant produces large, shield-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the trunk. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fertile fronds. Alsophila lepidophora thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
