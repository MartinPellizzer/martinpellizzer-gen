    "intro": "Aspidium pseudovarium, commonly known as the false water fern, is a member of the family Pteridaceae. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium pseudovarium plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
