    "intro": "Artemisia trichophylla, commonly known as silver sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that appear in late spring to early summer. Artemisia trichophylla is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with poor soil conditions. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
