It is characterized by its aromatic, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that appear in umbrella-shaped clusters. The plant is native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils. It produces small, oval fruits that are typically dispersed by wind. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
