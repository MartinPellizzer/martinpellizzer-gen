    "intro": "Alchemilla exaperta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in clusters atop leafless stems. Alchemilla exaperta thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and long-lasting flowers that attract pollinators."
