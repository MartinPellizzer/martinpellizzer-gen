    "intro": "Argyranthemum pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf argyranthemum, is a compact, flowering plant native to South Africa. It features small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, often blooming in shades of pink or red. The plant has a low-growing habit, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a bedding plant. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sun, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Its ornamental value lies in its vibrant blooms and ability to thrive in a variety of garden conditions."
