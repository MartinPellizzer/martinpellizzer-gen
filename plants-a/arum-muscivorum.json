    "intro": "Arum muscivorum, commonly known as the stinkbug plant, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence composed of a spadix and a spathe. The plant produces a foul-smelling odor to attract its primary pollinators, which are flies rather than bees. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and can grow quite large, often reaching up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant is often grown as an ornamental due to its striking foliage and unique floral structure."
