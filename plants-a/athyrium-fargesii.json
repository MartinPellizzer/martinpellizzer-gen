    "intro": "Athyrium fargesii, commonly known as the Farges' lady fern, is a deciduous fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It features elegant, finely divided fronds that are typically bioluminescent, with a distinctive dark green coloration. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium fargesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, fern-like appearance."
