    "intro": "Arbutus lucida, commonly known as the shining madrone, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, edible berries in the fall. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and have a leathery texture with a waxy coating. Arbutus lucida thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal forests and chaparral habitats."
