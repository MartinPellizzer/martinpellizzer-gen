The plant features a distinctive, arrow-shaped leaf and a spadix surrounded by a spathe, typical of the genus Arisaema. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in herbal medicine."
