    "intro": "Arenaria bourgaei, commonly known as the coastal sandflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy and coastal environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Arenaria bourgaei is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
