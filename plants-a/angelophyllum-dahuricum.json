    "intro": "Angelophyllum dahuricum, commonly known as the Siberian bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often appearing in clusters at the top of the plant. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, helping to conserve moisture in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or alpine settings. Angelophyllum dahuricum is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in cool, temperate regions."
