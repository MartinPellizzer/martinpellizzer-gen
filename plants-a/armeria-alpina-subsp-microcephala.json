    "intro": "Armeria alpina subsp. microcephala, commonly known as the alpine thrift, is a low-growing flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features compact, mat-forming growth with dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The leaves are linear and covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in cold, high-altitude environments."
