    "intro": "Agropyron cristatum, commonly known as the prairie grass or needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive, finger-like inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, dunes, and disturbed soils. It has narrow, bluish-green leaves and produces small, spike-like flowers that bloom in early summer. Agropyron cristatum is valued for its erosion control capabilities and is often used in restoration ecology projects."
