    "intro": "Alchemilla flavicoma, commonly known as golden alchemilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and covered in a fine, silky white down. Its small yellow flowers appear in late spring to early summer, forming compact clusters at the ends of the stems. Alchemilla flavicoma is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its ornamental appearance and hardiness."
