    "intro": "Astragalus lentiginosus var. piscinensis, commonly known as the Piscina milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This species plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat."
