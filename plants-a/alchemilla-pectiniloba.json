    "intro": "Alchemilla pectiniloba, commonly known as the woolly lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features silver-white, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance, and its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Alchemilla pectiniloba is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
