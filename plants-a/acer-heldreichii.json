    "intro": "Acer heldreichii, commonly known as the Hellenic maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically five-lobed and have a crisp texture. The tree produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Acer heldreichii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant autumn foliage.",
