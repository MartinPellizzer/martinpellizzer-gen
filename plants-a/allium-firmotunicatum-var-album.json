    "intro": "Allium firmotunicatum var. album, commonly known as the white onion, is a perennial bulbous plant native to Central Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers. The plant is characterized by its pale blue to white bulb, which is often used in traditional medicine and cuisine. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is closely related to other Allium species, such as the common onion, but is distinguished by its unique coloration and growth habits."
