    "intro": "Agaloma exserta, commonly known as the slender rock orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South Africa. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white or greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and requires well-drained conditions to thrive. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Agaloma exserta is considered endangered in some areas."
