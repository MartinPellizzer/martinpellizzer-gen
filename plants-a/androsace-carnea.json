    "intro": "Androsace carnea, commonly known as the pink rock jasmine, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features dense clusters of small, showy pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming habit with hairy, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Androsace carnea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form long-lasting ground covers in alpine gardens."
