It features lush, upright clusters of fragrant, plume-like flowers in shades of pink, white, or red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, dark green foliage that adds ornamental value throughout the growing season. It thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it ideal for woodland gardens. Its compact growth habit and extended blooming period make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking shade-tolerant ornamental plants."
