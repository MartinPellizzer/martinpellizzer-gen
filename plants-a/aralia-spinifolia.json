It features compound leaves with serrated edges and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that appear in late summer. The plant produces berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain birds. Its roots are fibrous and can be used in traditional medicine. Aralia spinifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
