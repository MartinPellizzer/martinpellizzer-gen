    "intro": "Aplotaxis caespitosa, commonly known as the Cape mountain daisy, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and white, which bloom during the summer months. Its compact growth habit forms a low, dense mat, making it well-suited for rocky or arid environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping."
