    "intro": "Agropyron nepalense, commonly known as the Nepal needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous narrow, awned lemmas, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Agropyron nepalense is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in its native habitat."
