    "intro": "Antiaris, commonly known as the Natal tree or stinkwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araliaceae. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is native to southern Africa and is often found in moist, tropical regions. Antiaris species are known for their slow growth and can reach heights of up to 20 meters. They are also valued for their durable wood, which has been used historically for construction and tool-making."
