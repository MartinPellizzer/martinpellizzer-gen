    "intro": "Androscepia anathera var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy Androscepia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America. It features slender, upright stems covered in soft, hairy foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a slightly rough texture. This variant is distinguished by its dense pubescence, which sets it apart from other varieties within the Androscepia genus."
