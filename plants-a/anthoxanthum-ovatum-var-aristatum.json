    "intro": "Anthoxanthum ovatum var. aristatum, commonly known as the tufted oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with dense clusters of slender, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to yellowish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
