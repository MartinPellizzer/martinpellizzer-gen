    "intro": "Allium litorale, commonly known as sea garlic, is a hardy perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale purple flowers in clusters. The plant is characterized by its strong garlic-like odor, which is released when the leaves are crushed. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing in rocky or sandy coastal areas. Allium litorale is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
