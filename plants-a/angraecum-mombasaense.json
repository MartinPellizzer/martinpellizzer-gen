    "intro": "Angraecum mombasaense, commonly known as the Mombasa orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the coastal regions of Kenya. It is a terrestrial orchid with long, slender pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of its habitat in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers with long, slender petals and a prominent lip, which are often fragrant. It blooms during the wet season, usually between March and June, and requires specific conditions to thrive. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered threatened in its natural range."
