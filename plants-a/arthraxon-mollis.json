It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit. The plant features narrow, flat leaves with a smooth surface and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Arthraxon mollis is often found in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. It is adapted to dry conditions and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
