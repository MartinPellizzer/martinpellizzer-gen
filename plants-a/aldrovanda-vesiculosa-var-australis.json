    "intro": "Aldrovanda vesiculosa var. australis, commonly known as the Australian waterwheel plant, is a carnivorous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, snapping traps that capture tiny aquatic prey. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, with each leaf bearing a series of trap-like structures. This variety is closely related to the more widely known Aldrovanda vesiculosa, but it is adapted to the specific environmental conditions of its native range."
