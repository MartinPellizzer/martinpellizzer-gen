It features a slender, wiry stem with a single or few leaves and produces a spike of small, delicate flowers. The flowers are typically greenish-yellow with purple or brown markings, and they bloom during late spring to early summer. This species thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on tree trunks or branches. Its unique morphology and specialized habitat make it a distinctive member of the orchid family."
