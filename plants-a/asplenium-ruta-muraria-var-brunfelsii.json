    "intro": "Asplenium ruta-muraria var. brunfelsii, commonly known as the broad-leaf rock fern, is a variant of the common rock fern characterized by its broader, more robust leaves. It is a perennial fern native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in rocky or limestone habitats. The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive frond structure that resembles a feather. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. This variety is closely related to other asplenium species and shares similar ecological preferences."
