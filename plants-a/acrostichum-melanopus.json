    "intro": "Acrostichum melanopus, commonly known as the black fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in rows on the underside of the fronds. The black fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings.",
