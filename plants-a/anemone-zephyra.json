    "intro": "Anemone zephyra, commonly known as the windflower, is a delicate perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, white or pale pink petals that resemble a crown, with a central cluster of yellow stamens. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are hairy to the touch, providing a tactile contrast to its elegant flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Anemone zephyra is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to bloom in early spring."
