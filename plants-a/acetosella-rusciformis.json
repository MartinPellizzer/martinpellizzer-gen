It belongs to the family Leguminosae (Fabaceae) and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges and shaded areas. It has a creeping habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense mats. Acetosella rusciformis is also notable for its medicinal uses, particularly in traditional herbal remedies.",
