    "intro": "Acrostichum cartilagineum, commonly known as the cartilage fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that resemble cartilage, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or near water bodies. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, fibrous layer that aids in water retention. Acrostichum cartilagineum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions.",
