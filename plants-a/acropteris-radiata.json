    "intro": "Acropteris radiata, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a unique fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that display a striking golden hue at the tips, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its reproductive structures are small, spore-bearing cones that develop at the base of the fronds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, Acropteris radiata is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation efforts.",
