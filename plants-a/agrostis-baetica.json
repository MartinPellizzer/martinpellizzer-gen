    "intro": "Agrostis baetica, commonly known as the Iberian meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and riverbanks. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, and it is adapted to temperate climates with adequate moisture. Agrostis baetica plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native range."
