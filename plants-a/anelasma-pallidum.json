    "intro": "Anelasma pallidum, commonly known as the pale anelasma, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, pale green leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces delicate, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the late spring to early summer. Anelasma pallidum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
