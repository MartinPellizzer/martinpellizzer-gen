It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant features a creeping rhizome that produces upright, spore-bearing fronds. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, rounded pinnae that give it a unique, shield-like appearance. Adiantum cycloides thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas.",
