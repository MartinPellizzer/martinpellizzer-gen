    "intro": "Astragalus viarius, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in dry, rocky soils. Astragalus viarius is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats."
