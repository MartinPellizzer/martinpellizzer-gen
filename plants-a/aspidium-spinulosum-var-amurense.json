It is a perennial aquatic plant characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that float on the water surface. The plant thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater habitats, such as ponds and streams. Its fronds are typically divided into small, narrow segments with serrated edges. This variety is notable for its ability to tolerate a range of water conditions and is often used in aquatic gardening."
