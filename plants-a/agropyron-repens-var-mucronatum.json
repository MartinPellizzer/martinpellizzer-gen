    "intro": "Agropyron repens var. mucronatum, commonly known as the creeping wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color, with a bluish sheen. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found in disturbed soils, lawns, and along roadsides. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
