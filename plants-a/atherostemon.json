It consists of several species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in Asia and North America. The plants typically have showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often with a white or yellow throat. They are herbaceous perennials that thrive in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight. The leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, contributing to the plant's elegant appearance."
