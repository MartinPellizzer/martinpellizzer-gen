    "intro": "Asplenium ebeneum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Madagascar. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, dark green fronds that are often adorned with intricate, lace-like patterns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps in soil stabilization. Asplenium ebeneum is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its ecological role in maintaining biodiversity in its native habitats."
