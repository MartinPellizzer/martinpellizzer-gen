    "intro": "Anthericum brachypodum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arum, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces a striking inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe, typical of the Araceae family. It blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects. The plant prefers moist, shady habitats and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
