    "intro": "Acer dasycarpum subvar. laciniatum, commonly known as the serrated maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves that are deeply serrated, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, red samaras that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming more fissured with age. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant autumn foliage.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer dasycarpum subvar. laciniatum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China, including the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Shaanxi. This species thrives in temperate to subalpine climates, often found at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. It is commonly associated with rocky slopes, forest edges, and areas with well-drained soils. The plant is part of the maple family (Aceraceae) and is known for its distinctive, lobed leaves and ornamental value. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer dasycarpum subvar. laciniatum was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates that provide adequate moisture and well-drained soils. It thrives in areas with full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for urban landscapes and garden settings. This variety is valued for its ornamental value, particularly its distinctive lobed leaves that turn vibrant colors in the fall. It has been introduced to several parts of the United States and Europe, where it is commonly planted for landscaping purposes. Due to its adaptability, it has become a popular choice for parks and residential gardens."
