    "intro": "Aspidium semicordatum, commonly known as the heart-shaped fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive heart-shaped outline in its young stages. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns. Aspidium semicordatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
