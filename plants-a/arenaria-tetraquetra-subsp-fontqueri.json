    "intro": "Arenaria tetraquetra subsp. fontqueri, commonly known as the Fontqueri sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
