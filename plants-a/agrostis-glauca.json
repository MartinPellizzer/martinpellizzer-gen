    "intro": "Agrostis glauca, commonly known as bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, dark green blades and tufted growth habit, often forming dense, low-growing sods. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family. Agrostis glauca thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and disturbed sites. Its ecological importance includes soil stabilization and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
