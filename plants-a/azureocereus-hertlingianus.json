    "intro": "Azureocereus hertlingianus, commonly known as the blue cactus or night blooming cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem covered in dense, blue-gray spines. The plant produces striking, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick stem for survival in dry environments. Azureocereus hertlingianus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique blooming habit."
