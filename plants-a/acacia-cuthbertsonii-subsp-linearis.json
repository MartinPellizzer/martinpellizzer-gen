    "intro": "Acacia cuthbertsonii subsp. linearis, commonly known as the linear acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, linear leaves that are typically arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces yellow globular flowerheads that appear in late winter to early spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.",

Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within Western Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia cuthbertsonii subsp. linearis was mainly introduced to South Australia and parts of Western Australia. It is commonly found in sandy soils along coastal regions and in dunes. This subspecies is known for its slender, linear leaves and yellow flowering spikes. It is often used in revegetation projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize sand dunes. However, it is considered a potential weed in some areas where it can spread rapidly."
