    "intro": "Anemia schaefferi, commonly known as the Schaeffer's anemone, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is a perennial herb with showy, white to pale pink petals that bloom in early spring. The plant has a fibrous root system and hairy stems that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its leaves are typically basal, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Anemia schaefferi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
