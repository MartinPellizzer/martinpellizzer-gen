    "intro": "Aechmea andradei, commonly known as the Andrade's pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's use. The leaves are typically green with a waxy texture and can develop a reddish or bronze hue as they mature. It produces vibrant orange or red flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette. This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its adaptability and ornamental appeal."
