    "intro": "Axonopus stragulus, commonly known as the creeping grass or narrowleaf carpetgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has slender, rhizomatous stems that allow it to spread aggressively across the ground, forming dense mats. The leaves are narrow, flat, and slightly hairy, with a blue-green coloration. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, wetlands, and disturbed areas. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain environments."
