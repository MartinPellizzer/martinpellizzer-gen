    "intro": "Asplenium viridissimum, commonly known as the green spleenwort, is a member of the Aspleniaceae family and is characterized by its small, evergreen, and often clustered foliage. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or in shaded forest floors, and is often epiphytic or lithophytic. The plant has lanceolate to ovate leaves that are usually dark green and have a leathery texture. It produces sporangia in clusters called sorus, which are typically located on the underside of the leaves. Asplenium viridissimum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
