    "intro": "Andropogon dieterlenii, commonly known as the Dieterlen's bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant features narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in many areas."
