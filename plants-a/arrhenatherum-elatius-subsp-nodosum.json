It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, tufted inflorescences that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often in meadows and grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, while the flowers are small and clustered in panicles. It plays a role in supporting local biodiversity and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
