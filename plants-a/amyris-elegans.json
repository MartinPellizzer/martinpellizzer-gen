It is a member of the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its ornamental value comes from its evergreen foliage and compact growth habit, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes. Amyris elegans is also valued for its essential oils, which are used in perfumery and traditional medicine."
