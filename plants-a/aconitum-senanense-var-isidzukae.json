It is native to the mountainous regions of Japan, specifically Honshu and Shikoku. This variant is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and large, showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces follicles containing toxic seeds, and its leaves are palmately divided with a distinctive veining pattern. Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling.",
