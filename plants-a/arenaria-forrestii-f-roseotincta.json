    "intro": "Arenaria forrestii f. roseotincta, commonly known as the rose-tinctured sandwort, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the alpine regions of China. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its unique coloration and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered endangered in its natural range."
