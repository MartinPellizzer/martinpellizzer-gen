    "intro": "Astragalus lotoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in steppe and sagebrush habitats. Astragalus lotoides is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in arid environments."
