    "intro": "Asplenium integrifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a smooth, leathery texture. Asplenium integrifolium is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rock crevices."
