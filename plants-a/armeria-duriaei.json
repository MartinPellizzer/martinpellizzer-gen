It features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring and summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid and saline environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.
