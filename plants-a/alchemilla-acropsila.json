It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are covered in soft, silvery-white hairs. The plant produces upright flowering stems that bear small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Alchemilla acropsila is also noted for its ability to tolerate wet soil conditions, making it a suitable choice for water gardens or boggy areas."
