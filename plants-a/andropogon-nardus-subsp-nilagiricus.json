    "intro": "Andropogon nardus subsp. nilagiricus, commonly known as Nilagiri grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, pale green to brown florets. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in grasslands and forest margins. Due to its ornamental and ecological value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine."
