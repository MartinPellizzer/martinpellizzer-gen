    "intro": "Acacia maitlandii, commonly known as the maitland acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are finely divided. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical heads, which bloom during the warmer months. Acacia maitlandii is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in traditional medicine.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia maitlandii is primarily native to New South Wales, Northern Territory, Queensland, and Western Australia. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions across these states. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often seen in shrublands and woodland habitats. It is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range. Its distribution reflects its ability to survive in dry, nutrient-poor environments.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia maitlandii was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in the Western Cape and parts of the Eastern Cape, thriving in sandy soils and coastal areas. This plant is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and ability to withstand drought conditions. However, it has also been reported to spread into native ecosystems, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. Its introduction has led to discussions about its ecological impact and management in local environments."
