    "intro": "Asplenium recumbens, commonly known as the creeping spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It typically grows on rocks, tree trunks, or soil, and is found in temperate regions around the world. The plant has a distinctive, low-growing habit with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky coating. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns. Asplenium recumbens is a hardy species that can tolerate a range of environmental conditions, making it a common sight in woodland and garden settings."
