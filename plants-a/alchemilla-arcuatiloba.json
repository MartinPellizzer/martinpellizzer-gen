    "intro": "Alchemilla arcuatiloba, commonly known as the silverweed or false agrimony, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to round, with a silvery-white underside due to dense pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, arranged in loose clusters atop the stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Alchemilla arcuatiloba is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
