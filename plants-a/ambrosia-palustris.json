    "intro": "Ambrosia palustris, commonly known as swamp ambrosia, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is an annual herb that typically grows in moist soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, which are characteristic of the Ambrosia genus. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a rough texture. Ambrosia palustris plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and provides habitat for various insects and small animals."
