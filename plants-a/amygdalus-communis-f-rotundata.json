    "intro": "Amygdalus communis f. rotundata, commonly known as the round-leaved almond. This is a botanical variety of the almond tree, characterized by its rounded, thick leaves that differ from the typical almond leaves. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in temperate climates. The plant produces small white flowers in the spring, followed by the development of almond-like fruits. While it is less commonly cultivated for commercial almond production, it is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical significance in botanical gardens."
