    "intro": "Astrophytum coahuilense, commonly known as the Coahuila star cactus, is a small, globular cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It features a short, spiny stem covered with areoles that bear clusters of white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has a distinctive star-shaped pattern on its surface, which is more pronounced in mature specimens. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stem. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant."
