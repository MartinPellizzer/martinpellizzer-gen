    "intro": "Aristida huillensis, commonly known as the Huill\u00e9n grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly found in the Andes region of Peru and Bolivia. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or semi-arid habitats. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are usually brown or beige in color. Aristida huillensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and resilience to harsh conditions."
