It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
