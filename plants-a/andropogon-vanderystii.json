    "intro": "Andropogon vanderystii, commonly known as Vanderyst's bluestem, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green blades and tufted inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-based flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. Vanderyst's bluestem is often found in association with other wetland grasses and is an important component of the ecological diversity in its native range."
