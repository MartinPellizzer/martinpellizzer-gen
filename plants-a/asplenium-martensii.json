    "intro": "Asplenium martensii, commonly known as Martens' spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, evergreen foliage, with lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered closely together. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors, where it can thrive in low light conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Asplenium martensii is a hardy species that is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation."
