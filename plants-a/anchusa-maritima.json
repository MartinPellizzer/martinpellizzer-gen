    "intro": "Anchusa maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a hardy perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers and spiny, silver-green leaves. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and rocky coastal areas. Its robust root system helps stabilize sandy soils, making it ecologically valuable in coastal environments. Anchusa maritima is also cultivated in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh conditions."
