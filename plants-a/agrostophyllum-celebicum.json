    "intro": "Agrostophyllum celebicum, commonly known as the Celebes mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Indonesian islands of Sulawesi and neighboring regions. It belongs to the family Viscaceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees, deriving some of its nutrients from the host while performing photosynthesis. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its berries are usually red or orange and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Agrostophyllum celebicum plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
