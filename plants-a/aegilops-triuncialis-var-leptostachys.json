    "intro": "Aegilops triuncialis var. leptostachys, commonly known as the slender-stalked wild wheat, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in poor soil conditions. This species is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement."
