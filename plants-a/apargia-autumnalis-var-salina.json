It is characterized by its yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in the fall, typically from September to November. The plant thrives in saline and brackish wetlands, adapting to high salt concentrations in the soil. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
