    "intro": "Alepidea basinuda var. subnuda, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock heath, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. It is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in full sun and requiring minimal water. This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
