    "intro": "Anarrhinum pubescens, commonly known as the hairy sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub with narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale pink to violet, typically blooming during the warm season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Anarrhinum pubescens plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
