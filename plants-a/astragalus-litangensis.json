It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, adapting to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are compound, with small leaflets that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Astragalus litangensis is also valued for its potential medicinal properties in traditional Chinese medicine."
