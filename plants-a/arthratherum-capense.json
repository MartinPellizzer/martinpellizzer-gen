    "intro": "Arthratherum capense, commonly known as the Cape grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open, sunny areas such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, spike-like flower clusters. Arthratherum capense is adapted to arid conditions and is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
