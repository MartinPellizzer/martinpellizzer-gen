    "intro": "Andicolea colombiana, commonly known as the Colombian rock fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, epiphytic growth habit, often found on rocky surfaces or tree trunks. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves with a serrated margin, and its reproductive structures are typically concealed within its foliage. Due to its restricted habitat and fragile ecology, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss. Conservation efforts are crucial to preserving this unique botanical species."
