The plant has a short, rhizomatous root system and produces trifoliate leaves with a heart-shaped base. It thrives in moist, shaded woodland areas and is often found in forest understories. Anemone viticella is valued for its ornamental beauty and is commonly cultivated in gardens and naturalized landscapes."
