It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows. Due to its attractive appearance and historical use in herbal medicine, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
