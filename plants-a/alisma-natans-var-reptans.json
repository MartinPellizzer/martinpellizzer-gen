    "intro": "Alisma natans var. reptans, commonly known as the floating arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to North America. It features narrow, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with roots submerged in the water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters at the water's edge. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can influence local aquatic ecosystems."
