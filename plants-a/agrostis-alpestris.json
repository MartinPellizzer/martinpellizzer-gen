    "intro": "Agrostis alpestris, commonly known as alpine grass or mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate and alpine regions. It typically grows in open, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to golden florets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture that helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. Agrostis alpestris plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms in its native ecosystems."
