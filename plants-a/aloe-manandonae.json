    "intro": "Aloe manandonae, commonly known as the Madagascar aloe, is a succulent plant native to the island of Madagascar. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers, which bloom during the dry season. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Aloe manandonae is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
