    "intro": "Artemisia laciniata var. racemosa, commonly known as the fragrant wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features gray-green, silvery foliage with finely toothed leaves that emit a strong, aromatic scent when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters called racemes, which appear in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and rocky gardens. Due to its aromatic properties, it is often used in herbal medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
