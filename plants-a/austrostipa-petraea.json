    "intro": "Austrostipa petraea, commonly known as the sandhill grass, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Austrostipa petraea plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert animals."
