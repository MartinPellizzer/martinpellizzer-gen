    "intro": "Athertonia diversifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock heath, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of bell-shaped, pale pink or white flowers. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. Athertonia diversifolia is often found in fynbos vegetation, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
