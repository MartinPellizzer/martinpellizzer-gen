It typically grows in moist, temperate climates at higher elevations. The plant is often associated with forest understory and rocky slopes. Its native distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these South American nations.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena subincisa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. The plant has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. However, it is considered a potential weed in some parts of its introduced range."
