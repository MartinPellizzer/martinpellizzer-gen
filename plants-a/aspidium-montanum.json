    "intro": "Aspidium montanum, commonly known as the mountain shield fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are often divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Aspidium montanum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
