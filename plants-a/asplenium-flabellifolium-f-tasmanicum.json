It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its intricate, fan-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its fronds are divided into numerous narrow segments, giving it a delicate, lacy appearance. This fern is native to Tasmania and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
