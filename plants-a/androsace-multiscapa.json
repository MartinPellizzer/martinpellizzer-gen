    "intro": "Androsace multiscapa, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically forms dense mats of small, rosette-like leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Androsace multiscapa is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
