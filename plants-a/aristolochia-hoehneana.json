It is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its unique, tubular flowers that resemble a pipe, often with a distinctive purple or greenish hue. Its leaves are heart-shaped and can grow quite large, contributing to its ornamental appeal. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
