    "intro": "Athyrium sororium, commonly known as the lady fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It features delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically bright green and have a graceful, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium sororium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
