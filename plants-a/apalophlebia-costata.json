    "intro": "Apalophlebia costata, commonly known as the serrated leaf fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often serrated along the edges. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients. Apalophlebia costata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
