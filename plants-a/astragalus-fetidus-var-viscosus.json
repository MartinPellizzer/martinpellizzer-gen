    "intro": "Astragalus fetidus var. viscosus, commonly known as stinkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its glandular, sticky leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It has a deep taproot system, which allows it to survive in arid conditions. The species is noted for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is a defense mechanism against herbivores."
