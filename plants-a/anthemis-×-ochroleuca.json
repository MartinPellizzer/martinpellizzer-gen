    "intro": "Anthemis \u00d7 ochroleuca, commonly known as the yellow chamomile, is a hybrid plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and bright yellow flower heads that resemble those of true chamomile. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow ray florets surrounded by tubular disc florets. It is native to southern Europe and thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Due to its ornamental value and mild aromatic properties, it is often cultivated in gardens."
