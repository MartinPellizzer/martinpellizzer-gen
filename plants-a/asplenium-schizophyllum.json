    "intro": "Asplenium schizophyllum, commonly known as the split fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that often have a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Asplenium schizophyllum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in both indoor and outdoor settings."
