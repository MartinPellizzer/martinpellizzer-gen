    "intro": "Avena alba subvar. fallax, commonly known as the white oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields, roadsides, and woodland edges. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, each bearing small, white to pale green florets. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in some ecological restoration projects."
