It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and glossy.

It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
