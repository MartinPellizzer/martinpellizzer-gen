    "intro": "Artemisia villarsii, commonly known as the Alpine wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its essential oils contain compounds like thujone and camphor, which contribute to its strong scent and medicinal properties. Artemisia villarsii is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic qualities."
