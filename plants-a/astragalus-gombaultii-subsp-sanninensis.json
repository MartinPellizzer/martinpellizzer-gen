    "intro": "Astragalus gombaultii subsp. sanninensis, commonly known as the Sanninense milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern France. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and supports local pollinators with its nectar-rich blooms. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
