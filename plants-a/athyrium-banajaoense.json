It belongs to the Athyriaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of brownish scales. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the undersides of the fronds."
