    "intro": "Arracacia hintonii, commonly known as Hinton's arracacha, is a perennial herb native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Its roots are often harvested for culinary use, though it is less commonly cultivated than other members of its family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
