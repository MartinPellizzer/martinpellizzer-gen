    "intro": "Acer pictum var. velutinum, commonly known as the velvet maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and striking foliage that turns vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The leaves are ovate with a serrated margin and a velvety texture on the underside. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse its seeds. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests.",
