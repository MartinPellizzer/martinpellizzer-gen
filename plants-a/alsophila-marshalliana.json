    "intro": "Alsophila marshalliana, commonly known as the Marshall's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive crown of fronds that gives it a unique, elegant appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and contribute to its structural support as it grows upward."
