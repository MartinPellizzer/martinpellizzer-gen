    "intro": "Antrophyum winitii, commonly known as the Winitii cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often a deep green in color. Native to the Philippines, this cycad thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs. Its botanical significance lies in its evolutionary history and role in understanding the development of cycads."
