    "intro": "Agrostis spica-venti var. patula, commonly known as the wind spike grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces spikelets that are often adorned with long, bristly hairs. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that adds visual interest to the landscape. Agrostis spica-venti var. patula is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
