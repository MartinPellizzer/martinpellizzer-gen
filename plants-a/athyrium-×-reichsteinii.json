    "intro": "Athyrium \u00d7 reichsteinii, commonly known as the hybrid Japanese painted fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Athyrium niponicum and Athyrium filix-femina. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that display a striking combination of green, silver, and sometimes pink hues. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. Its fronds are biennial, with the fertile spores produced on the underside of the leaves. Due to its sterility, it does not produce viable seeds and is propagated through division or spores."
