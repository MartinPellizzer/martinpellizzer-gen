    "intro": "Alnus vermicularis, commonly known as the creeping alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its finely toothed leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and along roadsides. Alnus vermicularis plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
