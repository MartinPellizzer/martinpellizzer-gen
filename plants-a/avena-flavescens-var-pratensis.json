    "intro": "Avena flavescens var. pratensis, commonly known as yellow oatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet-bearing panicle, producing small, yellowish flowers. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil."
