    "intro": "Asplenium exiguum nothosubsp. glenniei, commonly known as the Glenn's maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is often found growing in shaded, rocky habitats. Its small size and intricate frond structure make it a unique addition to botanical collections. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
