    "intro": "Alatiliparis auriculifera, commonly known as the ear-shaped leaf fern, is a rare and unique plant belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, ear-like lobes on its fronds, which give it its common name. The plant is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its leaves, typical of many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
