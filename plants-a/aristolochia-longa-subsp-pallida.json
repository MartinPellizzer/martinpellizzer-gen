    "intro": "Aristolochia longa subsp. pallida, commonly known as the pale Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, heart-shaped leaves and its fragrant, hooded flowers that resemble a pipe. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow fruits that contain kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal uses, it is cultivated in some regions, though it contains toxic compounds that require caution."
