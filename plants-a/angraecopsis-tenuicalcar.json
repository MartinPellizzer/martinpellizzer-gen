    "intro": "Angraecopsis tenuicalcar, commonly known as the narrow-spurred star orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its slender, elongated spur that extends from the base of its petals, a feature that is both ornamental and functional for pollination. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in areas with high humidity and filtered sunlight. Its flowers are usually pale green to white, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators like moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
