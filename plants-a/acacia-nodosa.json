    "intro": "Acacia nodosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and small, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are typically visited by nectar-feeding birds and insects. Acacia nodosa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. It is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in its native habitat.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia nodosa is primarily native to the Arabian Peninsula, particularly in the southern regions of Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Oman. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in coastal dunes and sandy soils. This species is well adapted to high temperatures and low rainfall, making it a common sight in desert ecosystems. It plays an important role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife. Acacia nodosa is also known for its distinctive nodules, which host nitrogen-fixing bacteria, contributing to soil fertility in nutrient-poor areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia nodosa was mainly introduced to areas with arid and semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the inland parts of Western Australia and South Australia. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber due to its hardy nature. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its invasive potential in certain environments. However, it plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
