    "intro": "Aspidium maximowiczianum, commonly known as the broad buckler fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The fronds are typically divided into multiple pinnae, each with a broad, ovate shape and a serrated margin. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of the pinnae, which are clustered in strobila. It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes."
