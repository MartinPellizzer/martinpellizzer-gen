    "intro": "Artemisia pallasiana, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which consists of aromatic, narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flower clusters called heads, which are typically wind-pollinated. Artemisia pallasiana is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in harsh environmental conditions. It has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
