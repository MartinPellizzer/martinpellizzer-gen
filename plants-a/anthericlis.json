    "intro": "Anthericlis, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their striking, spiky flower heads that resemble holly berries, often with blue or purple hues. Anthericlis species are typically found in coastal areas, where they thrive in sandy or saline soils. They produce small, tubular flowers that are pollinated by insects, and their leaves are usually narrow and succulent. The genus includes several species, such as Anthericlis maritima, which is native to the Mediterranean region."
