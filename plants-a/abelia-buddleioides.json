    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelia buddleioides is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically from Florida through Georgia and into South Carolina. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in woodland edges, thickets, and along stream banks. This plant is well adapted to the humid climate and partial to full sunlight conditions typical of its native range. It is often seen in the wild in areas with high moisture levels and is a popular choice for native gardens due to its ornamental value. Abelia buddleioides plays an important ecological role by providing food and habitat for various native insects and birds.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia buddleioides was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was brought in for its ornamental value, particularly its fragrant white flowers and attractive foliage. The plant has been widely cultivated in gardens and landscapes due to its hardiness and adaptability. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns about its ecological impact in non-native habitats."
