    "intro": "Anemone thomsonii, commonly known as Thomson's anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a rough, hairy texture, and the stems are usually covered in fine, white hairs. Thomson's anemone is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, early-season blooms."
