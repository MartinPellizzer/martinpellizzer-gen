    "intro": "Aspidium opulentum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium opulentum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
