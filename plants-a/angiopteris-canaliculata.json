    "intro": "Angiopteris canaliculata, commonly known as the grooved water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed fronds that are often described as having a water lily-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Angiopteris canaliculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and water features."
