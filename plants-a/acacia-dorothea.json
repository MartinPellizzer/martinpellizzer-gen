    "intro": "Acacia dorothea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing drought tolerance and efficient water use. Its seed pods are woody and contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Acacia dorothea is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia dorothea is primarily native to New South Wales. It is commonly found in the eastern regions of the state, particularly in areas with dry, sandy soils. This plant thrives in open woodlands and grasslands, often in regions with a Mediterranean climate. It is well adapted to the local environmental conditions, including seasonal droughts. Acacia dorothea plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia dorothea was mainly introduced to regions with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in areas with low rainfall and high temperatures, making it suitable for drought-tolerant landscaping. This plant is often used in reclamation projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its introduction has been noted in parts of Australia, the United States, and other regions with similar environmental conditions. However, its spread can sometimes lead to ecological concerns if it becomes invasive in native ecosystems."
