    "intro": "Alyssum oederi, commonly known as the rock allyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, typically blooming in spring. The plant has silvery-green foliage with a fuzzy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Alyssum oederi is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
