    "intro": "Adromischus rodinii, commonly known as the \"Lion's Tail\" or \"Coral Cactus,\" is a succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically bright green with a reddish tinge, especially when exposed to sunlight. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Adromischus rodinii is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight.",
