    "intro": "Aechmea dryanderae, commonly known as the Dryander's bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant's foliage is typically dark green with silver or white markings, enhancing its ornamental appeal. It produces vibrant red or orange flowers that emerge from the leaf axils, adding a dramatic visual contrast. Aechmea dryanderae thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
