    "intro": "Athyrium montanum, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often adorned with a pale, waxy coating. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spore-producing structures are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium montanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
