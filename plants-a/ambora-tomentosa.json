    "intro": "Ambora tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly ambora, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a waxy texture, and it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Ambora tomentosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance once established."
