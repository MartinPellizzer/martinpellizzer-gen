    "intro": "Arnica parvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arnica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow-orange flowers in the summer. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its alpine habitat. Arnica parvifolia is part of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance in high-altitude ecosystems."
