    "intro": "Alchemilla hybrida f. adpressepilosa, commonly known as the compact velvet cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features small, rounded leaves that are densely covered with fine, soft hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, erect stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its foliage and ability to form attractive ground covers."
