It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features slender, thread-like leaves that give it its common name, and it produces small, yellow flowers that develop into white, fluffy seeds. It thrives in moist, open habitats and is often found in grasslands and along stream banks. Atimeta filamentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
