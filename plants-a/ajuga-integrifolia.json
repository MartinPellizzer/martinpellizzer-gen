    "intro": "Ajuga integrifolia, commonly known as carpet bugle or broad-leaved ajuga, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with dark green, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically entire or slightly toothed. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender stalks above the foliage. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread readily, forming extensive ground cover. Ajuga integrifolia is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to suppress weeds in shaded environments."
