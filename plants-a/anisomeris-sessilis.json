    "intro": "Anisomeris sessilis, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring woody stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish-yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milkweed species are known for their milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested. Anisomeris sessilis plays a role in supporting local pollinators, including butterflies and bees, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
