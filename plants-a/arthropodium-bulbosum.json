    "intro": "Arthropodium bulbosum, commonly known as the yellow lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to New Zealand. It features a distinctive rosette of waxy, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with yellow or reddish hues. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in umbels at the base of the plant. Its underground bulbs are an important part of its structure, storing nutrients and enabling survival through harsh conditions. Arthropodium bulbosum is well adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
