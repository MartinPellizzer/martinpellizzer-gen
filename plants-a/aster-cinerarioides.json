    "intro": "Aster cinerarioides, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has finely divided, gray-green leaves that are aromatic when crushed, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Aster cinerarioides is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
