    "intro": "Arthratherum brachyatherum, commonly known as the short-stemmed hairgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense, tufted clumps with slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Arthratherum brachyatherum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting insect and bird populations."
