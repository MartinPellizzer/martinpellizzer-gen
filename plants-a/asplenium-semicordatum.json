    "intro": "Asplenium semicordatum, commonly known as the heart's-ear fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often curled or twisted, giving it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of ferns. Asplenium semicordatum is valued in horticulture for its unique foliage and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
