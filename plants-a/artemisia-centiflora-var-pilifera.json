    "intro": "Artemisia centiflora var. pilifera, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in dense, spherical clusters known as capitula, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, which contribute to its use in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant."
