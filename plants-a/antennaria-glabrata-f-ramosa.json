    "intro": "Antennaria glabrata f. ramosa, commonly known as the hairy willow herb, is a flowering plant characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It is native to regions of North America and thrives in sandy or rocky soils. This variant is distinguished by its more branched growth pattern compared to the typical form of Antennaria glabrata."
