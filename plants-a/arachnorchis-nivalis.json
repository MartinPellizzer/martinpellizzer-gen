    "intro": "Arachnorchis nivalis, commonly known as the snow orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the alpine regions of southern Australia. It produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. Arachnorchis nivalis is a rare and delicate species, often found in specific microhabitats within its native range."
