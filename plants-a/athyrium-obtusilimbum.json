    "intro": "Athyrium obtusilimbum, commonly known as the broad-leafed lady fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate fronds that are broad and often have a subtle, elegant appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fertile fronds. Athyrium obtusilimbum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various garden conditions."
