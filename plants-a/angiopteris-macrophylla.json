    "intro": "Angiopteris macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large fern species native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its massive, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, where it often forms dense mats on the water surface. Its fronds are divided into numerous pinnae, which are broad and leathery in texture. Angiopteris macrophylla plays an important ecological role by providing habitat for aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
