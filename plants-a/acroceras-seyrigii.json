    "intro": "Acroceras seyrigii, commonly known as the Seyrig's acroceras, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils, typically in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",
