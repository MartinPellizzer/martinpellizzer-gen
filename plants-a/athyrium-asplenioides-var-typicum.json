    "intro": "Athyrium asplenioides var. typicum, commonly known as the typical maidenhair fern, is a species native to Asia, particularly found in regions like China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a feathery appearance. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is typically found in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread vegetatively. The leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive glossy green color and a leathery texture."
