    "intro": "Anthemis coelopoda, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. The plant is also valued for its potential use in natural pest control due to the presence of pyrethrin compounds in its flowers."
