    "intro": "Alliaria lasiocarpa, commonly known as winter cress, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a low-growing herb that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly hairy surface, giving it the scientific name *lasiocarpa*, meaning \"rough fruit.\" The plant is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in moist meadows."
