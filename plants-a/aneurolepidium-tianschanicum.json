    "intro": "Aneurolepidium tianschanicum, commonly known as the Tianshan feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Aneurolepidium tianschanicum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitat."
