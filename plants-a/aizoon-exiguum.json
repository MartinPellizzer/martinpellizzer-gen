    "intro": "Aizoon exiguum, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a small, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. The plant has a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss through transpiration. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Aizoon exiguum is an important component of desert ecosystems, providing forage for small mammals and insects."
