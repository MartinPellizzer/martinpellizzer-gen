    "intro": "Aichryson pachycaulon subsp. immaculatum, commonly known as the immaculate aichryson, is a compact, shrub-like succulent native to South Africa. It features dense, fleshy foliage with pale green to bluish-gray leaves that are typically covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
