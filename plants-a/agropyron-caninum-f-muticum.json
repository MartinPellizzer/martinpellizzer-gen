    "intro": "Agropyron caninum f. muticum, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
