    "intro": "Artemisia ludoviciana var. brittonii, commonly known as blue mist shinnery, is a perennial shrub native to the Great Plains of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-blue foliage, which consists of narrow, gray-green leaves with a dense covering of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairie and steppe habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and visual appeal."
