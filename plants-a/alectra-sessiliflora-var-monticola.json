    "intro": "Alectra sessiliflora var. monticola, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. The plant has alternate, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. This variety is notable for its resilience to cold temperatures and its role in stabilizing soil in high-elevation habitats."
