It features small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow environments. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
