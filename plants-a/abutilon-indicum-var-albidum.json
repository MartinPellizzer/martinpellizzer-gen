It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with warm, humid climates. This plant thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, forest edges, and disturbed soils. It is often seen growing along roadsides and in coastal areas. Its native range extends to parts of the Pacific Islands as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon indicum var. albidum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-like flowers. It was brought there during the late 19th and early 20th centuries by horticulturalists and gardeners seeking to introduce exotic plant species. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it well-suited to the environmental conditions of these regions. However, it has since become naturalized in some areas, raising concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems. Its introduction highlights the historical trend of introducing non-native species for aesthetic purposes."
