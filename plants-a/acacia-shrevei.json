    "intro": "Acacia shrevei, commonly known as the Shreve acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and compound leaves that are typically reduced to small, rounded stipules. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by long, flat pods containing seeds. Acacia shrevei is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance and efficient water use. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for wildlife in its native range.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia shrevei is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, including parts of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and Sonora. This plant thrives in rocky soils and is often associated with desert scrub and grassland habitats. It is well adapted to hot, dry climates and can tolerate poor soil conditions. Acacia shrevei is an important component of the local flora in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia shrevei was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it can thrive in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its deep root system and ability to fix nitrogen. It has also been introduced to other parts of the world as an ornamental or for land reclamation projects. However, its spread can sometimes lead to ecological concerns in non-native environments."
