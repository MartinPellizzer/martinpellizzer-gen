    "intro": "Aciphylla aurea, commonly known as the golden cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form composed of numerous small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense heads. Its leaves are covered in a thick layer of white, waxy hairs that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Aciphylla aurea is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, often found in coastal and alpine regions.",
