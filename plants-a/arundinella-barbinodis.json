It is characterized by its tall, slender culms that can reach heights of up to 5 meters. The plant has nodes that are distinctly hairy, giving it its common name. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a smooth surface and a prominent midrib. Arundinella barbinodis is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, fertile soils."
