    "intro": "Avena borbonia, commonly known as the Bourbon oat, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its seeds are enclosed in a tough, bristly hull, and the plant is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils. Avena borbonia is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate appearance and drought tolerance."
