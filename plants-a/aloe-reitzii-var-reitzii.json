    "intro": "Aloe reitzii var. reitzii, commonly known as the Reitz's aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched stems with clusters of yellow flowers, often blooming in spring or early summer. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that has been used for its medicinal properties. It is well-suited for cultivation in rocky or well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
