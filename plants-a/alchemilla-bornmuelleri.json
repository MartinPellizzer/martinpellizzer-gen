    "intro": "Alchemilla bornmuelleri, commonly known as the Alpine lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features rosettes of soft, hairy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white woolly hair. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Alchemilla bornmuelleri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to tolerate harsh alpine conditions."
