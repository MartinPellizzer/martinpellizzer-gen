    "intro": "Argentina rupestris, commonly known as the rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Argentina. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Argentina rupestris is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and resilience in harsh environments."
