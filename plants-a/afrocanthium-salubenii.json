    "intro": "Afrocanthium salubenii, commonly known as the Salubenii's afrocanthium, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous roots. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in dense clusters, and bloom during the dry season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
