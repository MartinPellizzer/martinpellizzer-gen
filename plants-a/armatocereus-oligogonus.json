    "intro": "Armatocereus oligogonus, commonly known as the Mexican night bloomer, is a cacti species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems covered in white spines. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, requiring well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is a popular choice for desert gardens and botanical collections."
