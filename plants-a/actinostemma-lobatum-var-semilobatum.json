    "intro": "Actinostemma lobatum var. semilobatum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed actinostemma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern North America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic plants such as carrots and parsley. The plant features slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are pinnately lobed, with the lower leaves being more deeply divided than the upper ones. This variant is distinguished by its semi-lobed leaf structure, which sets it apart from the typical lobed form of the species.",
