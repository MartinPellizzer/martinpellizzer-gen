    "intro": "Armeria ovata, commonly known as the oval thrift, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Armeria ovata thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant for coastal gardens. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and sandy soils makes it a popular choice for coastal landscaping."
