    "intro": "Axonopus capillaris, commonly known as silky grass or narrowleaf stoloniferous grass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats on the ground, and its leaves are narrow, flat, and covered with fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the grass family. Axonopus capillaris is often found in moist, shaded areas such as lawns, gardens, and disturbed soils. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through stolons make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in cultivated landscapes."
