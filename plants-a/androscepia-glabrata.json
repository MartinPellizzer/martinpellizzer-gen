It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Androscepia glabrata is often found in coastal and inland dunes, contributing to the ecological stability of these environments."
