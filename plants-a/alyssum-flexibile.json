    "intro": "Alyssum flexibile, commonly known as flexible alyssum, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring and early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It is often cultivated as a ground cover or in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Alyssum flexibile is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
