    "intro": "Atriplex angustifolia, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in spikes. It is adapted to saline soils and can thrive in harsh, drought-prone environments. Atriplex angustifolia is also used in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
