    "intro": "Astragalus rubrivenosus, commonly known as the red-veined milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sagebrush steppe and desert habitats. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, contributing to soil fertility. The plant's vivid red veins in its leaves make it easily identifiable in its native range."
