    "intro": "Angraecopsis polydactyla, commonly known as the starry night orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its unique floral structure and nocturnal blooming habit make it a fascinating subject for botanical study. Angraecopsis polydactyla is also noted for its resilience to drought and its ability to attract specific pollinators such as moths and bats."
