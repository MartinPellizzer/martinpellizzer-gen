    "intro": "Acacia grandiflora, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. It produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds. Acacia grandiflora is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia grandiflora is primarily native to northern Australia, including the Northern Territory, Queensland, and Western Australia. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in areas with sandy or rocky soils. This plant thrives in dry climates and is often seen along roadsides, in open woodlands, and on coastal dunes. It is well adapted to the harsh conditions of the Australian outback. Its distribution is largely limited to the continent of Australia, with no natural presence elsewhere.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia grandiflora was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in the Eastern Cape and parts of the Western Cape. The plant thrives in coastal and inland areas with well-drained soils. It is often used for windbreaks and as a source of timber. However, its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in some ecosystems."
