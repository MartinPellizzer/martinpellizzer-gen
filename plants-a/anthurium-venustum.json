    "intro": "Anthurium venustum, commonly known as the velvet anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces vibrant, spadix-shaped inflorescences surrounded by a colorful spathe, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in humid, warm environments with indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium venustum is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and long-lasting blooms."
