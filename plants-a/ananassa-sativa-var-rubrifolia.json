    "intro": "Ananassa sativa var. rubrifolia, commonly known as the red-leaf pineapple, is a rare and ornamental variant of the pineapple plant. It is characterized by its striking red foliage, which contrasts beautifully with its typical green leaves. The plant produces the same sweet, aromatic fruit as the common pineapple, but its ornamental value makes it popular in gardens. It thrives in warm, sunny climates with well-drained soil. Due to its rarity, it is often cultivated for both its aesthetic appeal and unique fruit."
