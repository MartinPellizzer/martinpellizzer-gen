It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to arid conditions and can thrive in poor soils. Its botanical features make it a characteristic component of chaparral and woodland ecosystems."
