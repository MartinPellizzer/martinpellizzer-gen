    "intro": "Aloe archeri subsp. tugenensis, commonly known as the Tugen aloe, is a succulent plant native to the high-altitude regions of Kenya. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellow flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, storing water in its leaves to survive dry periods. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
