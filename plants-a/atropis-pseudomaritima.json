    "intro": "Atropis pseudomaritima, commonly known as the coastal marsh mallow, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems that often grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in saline environments. Atropis pseudomaritima is well adapted to coastal habitats, tolerating high salinity and frequent exposure to wind and salt spray."
