    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaulimalva richii is primarily native to Peru. It is found in the Andean regions of the country, particularly in the high-altitude areas of the central and southern Andes. This plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the harsh conditions of the mountainous terrain. Its native range is limited to specific ecological zones within Peru, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaulimalva richii was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It is considered an invasive species that has spread across various regions of the country. The plant thrives in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, riverbanks, and forest edges. Its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation have led to concerns about its ecological impact. Efforts are being made to control its spread and prevent further invasion of natural ecosystems."
