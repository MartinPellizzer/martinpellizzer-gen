    "intro": "Aerangis sankuruensis, commonly known as the Sankuru orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it has a short, thick rhizome. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
