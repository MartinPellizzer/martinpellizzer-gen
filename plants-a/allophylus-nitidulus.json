    "intro": "Allophylus nitidulus, commonly known as the glossy alder, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. The plant has simple, elliptical leaves that are usually glossy and dark green on top, with a lighter underside. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are borne in clusters and are followed by small, woody fruits. Allophylus nitidulus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its dense foliage and adaptability to various soil types."
