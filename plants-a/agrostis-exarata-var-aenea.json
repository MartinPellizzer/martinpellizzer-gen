    "intro": "Agrostis exarata var. aenea, commonly known as silver bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features narrow, silver-gray leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in landscaping."
