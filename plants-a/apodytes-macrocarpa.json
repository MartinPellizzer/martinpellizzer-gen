    "intro": "Apodytes macrocarpa, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, simple leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by large, woody pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and timber, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and for reforestation projects."
