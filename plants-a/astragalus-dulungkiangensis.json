    "intro": "Astragalus dulungkiangensis, commonly known as the Dolunghiang milkvetch, is a flowering plant species belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China, where it thrives in high-altitude, arid environments. The plant is characterized by its slender stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is adapted to withstand extreme climatic conditions. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
