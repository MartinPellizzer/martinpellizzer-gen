    "intro": "Acer lobatum, commonly known as the mountain maple, is a deciduous tree or shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its finely toothed, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. Its bark is often smooth and gray, with shallow furrows that become more pronounced with age. Acer lobatum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions and forested areas.",
