    "intro": "Aloe boehmii, commonly known as the Cape aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces striking orange-red flowers on tall, branched inflorescences, which bloom in summer. Aloe boehmii is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Its resilience and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
