    "intro": "Avena glumosa, commonly known as the slender oat, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed spikelets. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, which develop into dry, three-angled fruits known as caryopses. Avena glumosa is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and habitat restoration."
