    "intro": "Asparagus draco, commonly known as dragon asparagus, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
