    "intro": "Asperula arenicola, commonly known as the sand asperula, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of southern Europe. It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in dunes and coastal cliffs where it withstands salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are followed by red berries that attract birds. Its dense foliage provides erosion control and habitat for coastal wildlife. Asperula arenicola is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize unstable coastal soils."
