    "intro": "Arenaria filicaulis subsp. euboica, commonly known as the Euboean sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
