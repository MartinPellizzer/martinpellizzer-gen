    "intro": "Aspidium oshimense, commonly known as the Oshimense water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, particularly in countries like Japan, China, and India. The plant is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically borne on creeping rhizomes. Its reproductive structures, including sori and indusia, are well-developed and typical of the fern life cycle. Aspidium oshimense thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or near water bodies."
