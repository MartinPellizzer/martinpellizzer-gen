    "intro": "Adenia longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved adenium, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that are clustered in umbels, which bloom during the wet season. Its roots and stems contain milky sap, which is toxic and has been used traditionally in some regions for various purposes. Adenia longifolia is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in tropical climates.",
