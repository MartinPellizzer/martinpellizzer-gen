    "intro": "Atraphaxis caucasica, commonly known as Caucasian sandthrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its small, fleshy, gray-green leaves that are adapted to arid and rocky environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sandy or gravelly habitats. Atraphaxis caucasica is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
