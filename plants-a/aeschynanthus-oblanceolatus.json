    "intro": "Aeschynanthus oblanceolatus, commonly known as the hanging lantern plant, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its pendulous, tubular flowers that come in vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant has opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This plant is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
