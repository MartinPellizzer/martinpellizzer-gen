    "intro": "Agropyron caninum f. submuticum, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its fine, soft foliage. It typically grows in temperate regions and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a silky texture. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny grains of wheat-like seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a cover crop."
