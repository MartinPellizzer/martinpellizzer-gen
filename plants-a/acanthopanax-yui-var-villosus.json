It is commonly found in mountainous regions at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. This plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. It is often associated with secondary forests and shrublands in these areas. The species is known for its distinctive hairy stems and compound leaves.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopanax yui var. villosus was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates, particularly in East Asia. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been cultivated in gardens and parks. Its introduction has expanded its natural range beyond its native habitat. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts."
