    "intro": "Astragalus membranaceus var. mongholicus, commonly known as Chinese milk vetch, is a perennial legume native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems, trifoliate leaves, and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is known for its deep taproot system, which allows it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits. The plant's ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important component of soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
