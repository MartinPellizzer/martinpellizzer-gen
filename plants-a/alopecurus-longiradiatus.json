    "intro": "Alopecurus longiradiatus, commonly known as hairy vetch, is a flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and long, spreading rhizomes that help it form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, giving it a distinctive appearance. Alopecurus longiradiatus is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is used in ecological restoration due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities."
