    "intro": "Agrostis rupestris var. uliginosa, commonly known as the bog bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland and marshy environments. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in peat bogs and fens. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to low-nutrient conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems. Its presence is often an indicator of undisturbed, nutrient-poor habitats."
