    "intro": "Acrostichum magnum, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a member of the Cyatheaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its massive, tree-like trunk composed of tightly packed rhizomes and a crown of large, feather-like fronds. The plant can grow up to 10 meters tall, making it one of the tallest ferns in the world. Its fronds are bi-directionally arranged, with the upper fronds being sterile and the lower ones producing spores. Acrostichum magnum thrives in moist, shaded environments and plays a significant role in tropical rainforest ecosystems.",
