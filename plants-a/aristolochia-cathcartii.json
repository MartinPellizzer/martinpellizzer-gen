    "intro": "Aristolochia cathcartii, commonly known as the purple Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and striking, purple-tinged, pipe-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy, orange aril. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in shaded, moist woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it contains toxic compounds that require careful handling."
