    "intro": "Arachnorchis rigens, commonly known as the rigid spider-orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the eastern regions of Australia. It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with long, thin petals that resemble the legs of a spider. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. It produces striking, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
