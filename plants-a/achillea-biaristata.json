    "intro": "Achillea biaristata, commonly known as the Armenian yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features upright, branched stems that bear narrow, gray-green leaves with a fuzzy texture. The plant produces flat, composite flower heads in shades of white, pink, or lavender, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or alpine settings. Its historical use in traditional medicine is attributed to its aromatic compounds and potential anti-inflammatory properties.",
