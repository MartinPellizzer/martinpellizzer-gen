    "intro": "Amphistelma scoparium, commonly known as the rock cress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous or alpine regions. Its leaves are basal, pinnately divided, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Amphistelma scoparium is often found in open, sunny habitats and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
