    "intro": "Agrostis oligantha, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant is often found in moist, disturbed soils such as along stream banks, roadsides, and in wet meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively and establish quickly in suitable habitats. Agrostis oligantha is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small invertebrates."
