It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has a bulbous stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to minimize water loss.
