It features oval, dark green leaves that turn reddish-brown in the fall. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, dark blue berries in late spring to early summer. Its compact size and ornamental value make it suitable for small gardens and landscapes. The species is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing food for birds and pollinators."
