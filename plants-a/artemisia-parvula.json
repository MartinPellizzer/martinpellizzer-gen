    "intro": "Artemisia parvula, commonly known as dwarf sagebrush, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It features silver-gray foliage with narrow, linear leaves that are aromatic and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Artemisia parvula is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
