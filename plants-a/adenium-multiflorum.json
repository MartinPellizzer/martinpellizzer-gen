    "intro": "Adenium multiflorum, commonly known as the desert candle, is a striking plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its swollen, bottle-shaped trunk and smooth, pale green bark. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the rainy season, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are typically small and alternate, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Adenium multiflorum is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its deep root system and ability to store water in its trunk.",
