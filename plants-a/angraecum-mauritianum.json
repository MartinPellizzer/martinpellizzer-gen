    "intro": "Angraecum mauritianum, commonly known as the Mauritius orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to Madagascar. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, moist environments within dense forests. The plant produces striking white or pale green flowers with long, slender sepals and petals. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is classified as critically endangered."
