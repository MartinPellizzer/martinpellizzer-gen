    "intro": "Asplenium muellerianum, commonly known as the Mueller's spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, lanceolate fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or forest floors. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns. Asplenium muellerianum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
