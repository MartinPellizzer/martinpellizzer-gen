    "intro": "Aporosa ledermanniana, commonly known as the Ledermann's aporosa, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom during the wet season. It produces small, round berries that are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
