    "intro": "Apargia communis, commonly known as the common apargia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant features a slender, upright stem with whorled leaves that are lance-shaped and often tinged with red or purple at the base. Its small, white to pale blue flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences and bloom in early to mid-summer. Apargia communis plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and wildlife."
