    "intro": "Androsace vitaliana subsp. sesleri, commonly known as the Alpine chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It typically features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, bright green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
