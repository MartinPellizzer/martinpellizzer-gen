    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris proles decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate lady\u2019s mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense clusters of silver-white, shield-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in summer, which are clustered in branched inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream sides. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
