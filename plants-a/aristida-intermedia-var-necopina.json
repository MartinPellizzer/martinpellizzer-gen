    "intro": "Aristida intermedia var. necopina, commonly known as the narrowleaf threeawn, is a grass species native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in semi-arid regions and can tolerate poor soil conditions."
