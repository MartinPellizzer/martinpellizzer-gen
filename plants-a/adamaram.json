    "intro": "Adamaram, commonly known as the Indian nettle or *Urtica dioica*, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Urticaceae family. It is characterized by its stinging hairs on the stems and leaves, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is found throughout temperate regions. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are often heart-shaped with serrated edges. Adamaram is used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
