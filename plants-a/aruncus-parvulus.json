    "intro": "Aruncus parvulus, commonly known as small mountain avens, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features a tall, branched stem that bears clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided, fern-like lobes that are often covered in a whitish down. Aruncus parvulus is valued in gardens for its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in partial shade."
