    "intro": "Aristotelia peduncularis, commonly known as the kawakawa tree, is a native New Zealand plant belonging to the Elaeocarpaceae family. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub, typically reaching heights of up to 10 meters. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a glossy green upper surface with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers followed by fleshy, orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. It is often found in coastal and lowland forest habitats, playing a role in both ecological and traditional M\u0101ori contexts."
