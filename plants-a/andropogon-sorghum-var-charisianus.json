    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum var. charisianus, commonly known as purpletop sorghum, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and striking purple-tinted foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with purple or red hues. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
