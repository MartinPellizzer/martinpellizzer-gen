    "intro": "Alchemilla glaberrima subsp. flexicaulis, commonly known as the slender lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that often forms a mat-like structure. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in upright cymes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive leaves and ability to form dense ground cover."
