    "intro": "Astronidium floribundum, commonly known as the Christmas star or starfruit tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, yellow-orange fruits that are edible and resemble star-shaped fruits, hence its common name. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Astronidium floribundum is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its fruit, which is used in local cuisines and traditional medicine."
