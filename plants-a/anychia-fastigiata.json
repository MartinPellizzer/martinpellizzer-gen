    "intro": "Anychia fastigiata, commonly known as the upright anychia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright, branching stems covered in fine, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Anychia fastigiata prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a suitable choice for garden borders or rock gardens."
