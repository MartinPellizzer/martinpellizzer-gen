It features a dense mat of foliage with ovate, glaucous leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to rose-colored flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
