It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices, woodlands, and along stream banks. The plant has a distinctive appearance, characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often marked with yellow or brown spots. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and contain spores for propagation. Asplenium punctatum is a hardy species that is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
