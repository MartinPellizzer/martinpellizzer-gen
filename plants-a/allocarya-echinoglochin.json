    "intro": "Allocarya echinoglochin, commonly known as the spiny globe lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in temperate regions. It forms a dense, crust-like thallus with a yellowish to orange-brown coloration. The plant's structure consists of a fungal matrix that hosts green algae, primarily Trebouxia species, which contribute to its photosynthetic capabilities. Allocarya echinoglochin is often found on tree bark, rocks, and soil surfaces, where it plays a role in nutrient cycling. Its spiny, granular texture gives it a distinctive appearance, making it easily identifiable in its natural habitat."
