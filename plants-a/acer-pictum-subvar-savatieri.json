    "intro": "Acer pictum subvar. savatieri, commonly known as the red maple or river maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking red to orange-red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The leaves are opposite, simple, and have a finely toothed margin, often with a reddish tinge during the growing season. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in floodplain forests. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that disperse by wind.",
