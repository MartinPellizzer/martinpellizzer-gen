    "intro": "Agrostis densa, commonly known as dense bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has fine, tufted leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in lawns and golf courses due to its dense growth habit. Agrostis densa is also an important forage plant for livestock in certain regions."
