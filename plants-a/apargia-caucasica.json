    "intro": "Apargia caucasica, commonly known as Caucasian apargia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
