    "intro": "Amygdalus hortensis, commonly known as the garden almond, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, fuzzy fruits called drupes, which contain a single almond-like seed. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible seeds. Amygdalus hortensis prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice in gardens and landscapes."
