    "intro": "Aloe montana, commonly known as the mountain aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces upright, branched inflorescences with yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in summer. Aloe montana is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Its leaves can be used for medicinal purposes, similar to other aloe species."
