    "intro": "Anemone hortensis var. grandiflora, commonly known as the garden anemone, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe. It features showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, typically appearing in early spring. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are dark green and provide a striking contrast to its blooms. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its botanical characteristics include a short rhizomatous root system and a tendency to spread through rhizomes, forming dense colonies over time."
