It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green blades that are often used in ornamental landscaping. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, contributing to its ecological value in native plant gardens."
