    "intro": "Aechmea platyphylla, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, waxy leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red or orange flowers, often followed by small, showy berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is widely cultivated as a houseplant and in botanical gardens."
