    "intro": "Asclepias lanceolata f. flaviflora, commonly known as the yellow-flowered milkweed, is a variant of the common milkweed species. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and striking yellow flowers, which are typically smaller than those of the standard species. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release fluffy seeds with silky parachutes, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in prairies and open woodlands. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like butterflies."
