    "intro": "Alsodeia immersa, commonly known as water alsike, is a small annual herb that typically grows in wet or muddy environments. It has slender, branching stems that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, linear to lanceolate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Alsodeia immersa is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along the edges of ponds."
