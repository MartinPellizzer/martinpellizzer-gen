    "intro": "Axonopus pressus, commonly known as carpetgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It forms dense, mat-like growth that often covers the ground, making it a common weed in lawns and agricultural fields. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 inch wide. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers and relies on wind for pollination. Due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, it is both a nuisance and a useful plant in certain ecological contexts."
