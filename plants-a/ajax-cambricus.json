    "intro": "Ajax cambricus, commonly known as the Welsh mountain orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Wales. It is a herbaceous plant with delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a short, upright stem and produces small, spurred orchid flowers that are characteristic of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist environment. Due to habitat loss, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
