    "intro": "Abies alba subsp. pardei, commonly known as the Carpathian fir, is a subspecies native to the Carpathian Mountains in Central and Eastern Europe. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The bark is typically gray to brown and becomes fissured with age, while the cones are cylindrical and often remain attached to the branches for a long time. This subspecies is adapted to cold, mountainous climates and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.",

This subspecies is found in countries such as Romania, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Croatia. It typically grows in high-altitude forests and is adapted to cooler, moist climates. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mixed coniferous forests. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies alba subsp. pardei was mainly introduced to Europe, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe, as a ornamental and timber species. It has been cultivated in various countries including Germany, Poland, and the Czech Republic. The introduction is primarily due to its attractive appearance and economic value. However, it is not native to these regions and has been introduced through horticultural and forestry activities. Its distribution is now limited to areas where it has been intentionally planted."
