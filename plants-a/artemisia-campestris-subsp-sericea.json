    "intro": "Artemisia campestris subsp. sericea, commonly known as silver wormwood, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It features aromatic, silvery-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance and contribute to its strong, camphor-like scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicle clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas. Due to its medicinal properties and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
