    "intro": "Anthriscus elatior, commonly known as giant cow parsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and showy white or pale yellow flowers. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, calcareous soils in woodland edges and meadows. The plant can grow up to 2 meters tall, with a taproot that makes it persistent in the landscape. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is sometimes considered invasive in certain regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
