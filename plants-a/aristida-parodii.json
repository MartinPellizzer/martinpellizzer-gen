It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
