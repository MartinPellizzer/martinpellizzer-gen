    "intro": "Athyrium auriculatum, commonly known as the auriculate wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds with a distinctive auriculate (ear-shaped) base on the pinnae. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of brownish, hairy scales. Athyrium auriculatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
