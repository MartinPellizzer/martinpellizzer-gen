It is a perennial vine that produces unique, heart-shaped flowers with a distinctive, often foul-smelling interior. The plant belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its tubular, spurred flowers that attract specific pollinators. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough, textured surface. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
