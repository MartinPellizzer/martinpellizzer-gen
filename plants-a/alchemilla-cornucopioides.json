    "intro": "Alchemilla cornucopioides, commonly known as the golden tutsan, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, silver-gray foliage that is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by small, greenish fruits. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Alchemilla cornucopioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
