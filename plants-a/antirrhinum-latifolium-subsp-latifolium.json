It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of brightly colored, tubular flowers that range from red to orange and yellow. The leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy texture. This species thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early autumn."
