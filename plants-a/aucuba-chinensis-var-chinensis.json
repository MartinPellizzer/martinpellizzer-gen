    "intro": "Aucuba chinensis var. chinensis, commonly known as the Japanese aucuba, is a broadleaf evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia. It features glossy, dark green elliptical leaves with yellow-orange veins that contrast vividly with the foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and adaptability. The varietal form 'chinensis' is distinguished by its compact growth habit and striking leaf coloration."
