    "intro": "Agropyron bromiforme, commonly known as the bromegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and spikelet-bearing inflorescence, which consists of small, dense clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, fields, and dunes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and bluish-green, with a rough texture, and its seeds are small and wind-dispersed. Agropyron bromiforme is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
