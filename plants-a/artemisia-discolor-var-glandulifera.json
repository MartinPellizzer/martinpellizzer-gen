    "intro": "Artemisia discolor var. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular artemisia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage with dense, branched stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in panicles, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are covered in glandular dots, which contribute to its strong, camphor-like scent. This variant is often used in traditional medicine and horticulture for its ornamental value and medicinal properties."
