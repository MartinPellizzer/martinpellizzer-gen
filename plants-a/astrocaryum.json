    "intro": "Astrocaryum, commonly known as the wax palm, is a genus of flowering plants in the Arecaceae family. These palms are native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela. They are characterized by their tall, slender trunks and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The fruit of some species is edible and has a nut-like appearance, while others produce a waxy substance used in traditional crafts. Astrocaryum species play an important ecological role in their native habitats, providing food and shelter for various wildlife."
