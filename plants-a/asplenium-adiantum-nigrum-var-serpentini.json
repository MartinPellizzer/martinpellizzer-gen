    "intro": "Asplenium adiantum-nigrum var. serpentini, commonly known as the serpent's tail fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble the scales of a serpent, giving it its common name. This plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in shaded, moist environments. The fronds are typically dark green with a glossy appearance, and the plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of the leaves. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
