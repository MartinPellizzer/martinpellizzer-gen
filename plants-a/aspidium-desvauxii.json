    "intro": "Aspidium desvauxii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in stream banks and rocky areas. Aspidium desvauxii is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
