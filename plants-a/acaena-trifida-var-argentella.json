This variety thrives in a variety of habitats, including rocky soils and open vegetation. It is commonly observed in areas with a temperate climate and is often associated with native shrubs. The plant plays a role in the ecological systems of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena trifida var. argentella was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive silver foliage. The introduction occurred in the 19th century during the early days of European settlement. It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now considered a potential weed in some regions. Its distribution is primarily confined to the North Island, though it has been reported in parts of the South Island as well."
