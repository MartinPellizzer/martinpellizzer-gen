    "intro": "Anthemis montana var. balcanica, commonly known as the Balkan sandthrift, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and sandy soils. The plant features slender, branching stems with narrow, gray-green leaves that have a fuzzy texture. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in dense, spherical heads, resembling a star-like pattern. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
