It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble lace. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in rows along the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity to flourish. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and humid environments.",
