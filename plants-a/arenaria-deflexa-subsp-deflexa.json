    "intro": "Arenaria deflexa subsp. deflexa, commonly known as the bent sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender stems. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Its botanical features make it well-suited for ecological restoration projects in arid and disturbed habitats."
