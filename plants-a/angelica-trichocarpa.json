It features large, umbrella-shaped flowers and can grow up to 12 feet in height. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves with a strong, often unpleasant odor. Its roots are thick and fleshy, and the plant is known for its toxicity due to the presence of phototoxic compounds. It is often considered an invasive species in many regions."
