    "intro": "Antennaria monocephala, commonly known as the single-headed willow herb, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble single flowers. The plant features a short, often prostrate stem with dense, glandular hairs that give it a woolly appearance. Its small, yellowish flowers are typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Antennaria monocephala thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments."
