    "intro": "Androsace elongata subsp. acuta, commonly known as the sharp-tipped rock lettuce, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe. It features a rosette of narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
