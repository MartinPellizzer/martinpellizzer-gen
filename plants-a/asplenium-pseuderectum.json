It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are often curled when young. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Asplenium pseuderectum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
