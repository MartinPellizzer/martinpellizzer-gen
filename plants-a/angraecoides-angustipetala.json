It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale blue, with long, slender petals and a prominent spur. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its native habitat. Due to its specific requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
