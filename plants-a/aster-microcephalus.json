    "intro": "Aster microcephalus, commonly known as the dwarf aster, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features small, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. The plant has a compact growth habit with fine, hairy leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Aster microcephalus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
