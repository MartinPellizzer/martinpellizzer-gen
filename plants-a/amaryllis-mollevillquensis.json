    "intro": "Amaryllis mollevillquensis, commonly known as the Mollevillqu\u00e9n amaryllis, is a rare and striking plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family, which includes many ornamental and bulbous plants. The plant produces large, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, often with a strong fragrance. Its bulbs are adapted to survive in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
