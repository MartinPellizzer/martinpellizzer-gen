It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, and they bloom during the wet season, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
