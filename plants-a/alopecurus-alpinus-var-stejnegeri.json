It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as alpine meadows, rocky slopes, and grasslands. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence bears numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude environments."
