    "intro": "Arenaria tetraquetra var. frigida, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to cold, alpine environments. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in rocky or sandy soils. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with numerous stolons that help it spread across the ground. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in harsh conditions. It is often found in mountainous regions of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils."
