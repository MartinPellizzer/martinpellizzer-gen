    "intro": "Astrantia carniolica, commonly known as the Carpathian aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It features upright, branched stems that bear clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers with prominent central disks. The plant has palmate, heart-shaped leaves that are finely toothed and covered in a soft, velvety texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Astrantia carniolica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
