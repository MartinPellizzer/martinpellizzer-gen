    "intro": "Astragalus bourgaeanus var. adpressipilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It features slender stems that grow close to the ground, often forming a low, sprawling mat. The plant has small, pinnately compound leaves with numerous narrow leaflets, and its flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in dense, globular clusters. It is adapted to harsh, dry environments and has deep taproots to access water from deeper soil layers. This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soils in semi-arid habitats."
