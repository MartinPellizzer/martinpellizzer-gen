It features upright stems that bear clusters of small, blue or violet flowers with distinctive spurred petals. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often glandular and emit a mild, spicy scent. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Anchusa pustulata is known for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
