    "intro": "Allantodia umbrosa, commonly known as the shadowy allantodia, is a rare flowering plant native to the understory of tropical rainforests. It thrives in low-light conditions, making it well-adapted to dense, shaded environments. The plant features broad, waxy leaves that help retain moisture in humid climates. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often displaying shades of white and pale pink. It plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
