    "intro": "Adiantopsis fordii, commonly known as the Ford's maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds that resemble those of the common maidenhair fern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Adiantopsis fordii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.",
