    "intro": "Anisocampium sheareri, commonly known as the narrowleaf false nettle, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes stinging nettles, and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its stems are often covered with fine hairs. Anisocampium sheareri typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is often mistaken for true nettles due to its similar appearance, but it lacks the stinging hairs found on most species of Urtica."
