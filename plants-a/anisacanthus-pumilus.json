It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces striking orange-red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established, making it a hardy choice for gardens. Its compact size and showy blooms make it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates."
