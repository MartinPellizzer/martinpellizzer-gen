    "intro": "Acrostichum repandum var. quoyanum, commonly known as the Quoyanum sword fern, is a variant of the common sword fern native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its sword-shaped, leathery fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swamps, along stream banks, and in coastal areas. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients. The fronds are typically dark green and have a smooth, glossy surface, making it a distinctive and ornamental plant in wetland habitats.",
