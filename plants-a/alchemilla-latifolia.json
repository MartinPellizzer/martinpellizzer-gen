    "intro": "Alchemilla latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that form a rosette at the base, often with a silver-gray underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Alchemilla latifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional use in herbal medicine."
