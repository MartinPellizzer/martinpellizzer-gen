    "intro": "Astragalus frickii var. longirostris, commonly known as the long-beaked milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish to greenish flowers arranged in clusters. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
