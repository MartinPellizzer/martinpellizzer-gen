    "intro": "Athyrium biserrulatum, commonly known as the serrated wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are often divided into narrow, overlapping segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are often covered in a layer of brown, fibrous tissue. Athyrium biserrulatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
