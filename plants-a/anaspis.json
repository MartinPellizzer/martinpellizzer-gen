    "intro": "Anaspis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. Anaspis species are typically herbaceous perennials, though some may exhibit shrub-like growth forms. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and are known for their showy, often yellow or orange flowers. The genus includes several species, such as *Anaspis trichotoma*, which is widely distributed in the Caribbean and parts of Central America."
