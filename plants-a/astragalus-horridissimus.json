    "intro": "Astragalus horridissimus, commonly known as the horrid milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures. Its trifoliate leaves and pod-like fruits are typical of the Fabaceae family. Due to its habitat preferences, it is often found in dry mountainous areas and is considered a rare and sensitive species."
