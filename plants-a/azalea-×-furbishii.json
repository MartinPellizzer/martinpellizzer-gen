    "intro": "Azalea \u00d7 furbishii, commonly known as Furbish's azalea, is a hybrid evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rhododendron genus and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of funnel-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and thrives in acidic, well-drained soil. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in early spring, adding ornamental value to gardens. Due to its limited natural range and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and protected habitats."
