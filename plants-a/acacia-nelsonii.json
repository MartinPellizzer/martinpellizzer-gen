    "intro": "Acacia nelsonii, commonly known as the Nelson's wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant is notable for its yellow flowers, which appear in clusters and bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller leaflets, and it has a distinctive flaky bark. Acacia nelsonii is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia nelsonii is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Texas. This plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, including desert scrub and rocky areas. It is well adapted to hot, dry climates with low rainfall. Acacia nelsonii is often seen in areas with well-drained soils and is a common component of local plant communities.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia nelsonii was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly found in areas with low rainfall and poor soil conditions. This plant is often used in reclamation projects due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in harsh environments. Its introduction has helped in restoring degraded lands across parts of Australia and other dry regions. However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native habitats."
