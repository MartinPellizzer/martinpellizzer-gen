It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale green, followed by small, spherical fruits. It is adapted to dry, coastal climates and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. This variety is distinguished by its rounded leaf tips, which set it apart from other varieties of Adenostoma.",
