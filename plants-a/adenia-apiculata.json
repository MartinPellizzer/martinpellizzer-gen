It belongs to the family Passifloraceae and is characterized by its distinctive, warty, horn-like structures on its stems. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers with prominent stamens, which attract pollinators such as birds and insects. Its fruit is a fleshy, yellowish berry that ripens in late summer and is edible for both humans and animals. Adenia apiculata is often found in rocky or limestone soils in dry, open habitats.",
