    "intro": "Alchemilla subnivalis var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous alpine lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, soft hairs that help protect it from harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in rounded inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often found in mountain meadows and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
