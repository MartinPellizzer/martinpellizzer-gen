    "intro": "Agasyllis salsa, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces striking blue or violet flowers that open in the morning and close by midday. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, white pubescence. Agasyllis salsa is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
