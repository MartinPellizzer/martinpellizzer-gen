    "intro": "Ammopursus, commonly known as the sand sedge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with narrow leaves and small, clustered flowers. These plants are typically found in sandy or coastal environments, where they thrive in well-drained soils. Ammopursus species are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize sand dunes. Their botanical features make them important indicators of coastal ecosystem health."
