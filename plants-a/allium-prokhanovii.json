    "intro": "Allium prokhanovii, commonly known as the Prokhanov's garlic, is a bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves and umbel-like inflorescence. The plant produces small, white or purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild garlic flavor, making it a potential candidate for culinary use. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural habitat."
