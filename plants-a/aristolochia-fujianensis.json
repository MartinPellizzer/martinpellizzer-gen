    "intro": "Aristolochia fujianensis, commonly known as the Fujian pipevine, is a climbing plant native to southern China. It is characterized by its unique, heart-shaped leaves and striking, pipe-like flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, musky odor. The plant belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is known for its complex floral structure that resembles a pipe or a tube. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and the plant produces small, berry-like fruits that contain toxic seeds. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal uses, it is sometimes cultivated, though it is also considered an invasive species in some regions."
