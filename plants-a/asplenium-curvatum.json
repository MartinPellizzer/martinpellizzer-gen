It is characterized by its compact, dark green, leathery fronds that are typically curled or twisted, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in clusters called sori.

Asplenium curvatum is a hardy plant that is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
