    "intro": "Arundo karka, commonly known as giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It features long, narrow leaves and can grow up to 6 meters in height. The plant has a robust rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread aggressively. It thrives in moist environments such as wetlands and riverbanks. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive."
