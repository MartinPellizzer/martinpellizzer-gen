    "intro": "Artemisia desertorum var. richardsoniana, commonly known as the Richardson's sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of aromatic, narrow, and linear leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in panicles during the summer months, contributing to its role in pollination and ecological systems. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in drought conditions. This variety is often found in desert and steppe habitats, playing a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
