It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters. Its latex is milky and can be toxic, which is a common trait among plants in the Euphorbiaceae family. Apterocaryon michauxii is often found in wetland habitats and is valued for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
