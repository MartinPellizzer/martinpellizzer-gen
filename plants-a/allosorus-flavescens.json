    "intro": "Allosorus flavescens, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its root system is extensive and adapted for anchoring in sandy or rocky soils. Allosorus flavescens is often found in disturbed areas, such as along roadsides or in dry meadows, and is valued for its resilience and ornamental appeal."
