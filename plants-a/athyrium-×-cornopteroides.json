    "intro": "Athyrium \u00d7 cornopteroides, commonly known as the hybrid fern, is a deciduous fern species resulting from the cross between Athyrium filipendulum and Athyrium niponicum. It features lance-shaped, deeply lobed fronds that are typically green with a silvery underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is native to East Asia and thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas. It produces small, greenish spore cases called sori on the underside of its fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
