    "intro": "Artemisia aromatica, commonly known as sweet wormwood, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features silver-gray foliage with aromatic, finely divided leaves that release a distinctive, camphor-like scent when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Its essential oils, rich in compounds like artemisinin, have been used in traditional medicine and modern pharmaceuticals."
