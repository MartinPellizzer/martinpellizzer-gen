    "intro": "Aeonium arboreum subsp. arboreum, commonly known as the tree aeonium, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy, bluish-green leaves that form a compact, tree-like structure. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a striking addition to both indoor and outdoor landscapes."
