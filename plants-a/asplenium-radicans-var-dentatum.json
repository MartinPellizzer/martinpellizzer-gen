    "intro": "Asplenium radicans var. dentatum, commonly known as the creeping shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, producing dense, low-growing mats of foliage. The leaves are typically lanceolate, with serrated margins that give it the \"dentatum\" designation. The fronds are usually dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist, rocky or shaded forest floors."
