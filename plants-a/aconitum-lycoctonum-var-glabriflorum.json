    "intro": "Aconitum lycoctonum var. glabriflorum, commonly known as the smooth-flowered aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, blue to purple spires of flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has large, palmately compound leaves with deeply cut lobes, and its stems are typically hairy. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens.",
