    "intro": "Atriplex cinerea var. elaeagnoides, commonly known as silverleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which reflects sunlight and reduces water loss. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are densely packed, aiding in drought tolerance. It produces small greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are wind-pollinated. This species is often found in saline soils and is used for erosion control and as forage for wildlife."
