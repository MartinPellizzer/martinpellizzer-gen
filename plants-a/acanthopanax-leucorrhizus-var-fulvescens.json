This variety thrives in mountainous regions with temperate to subtropical climates. It is commonly found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. The plant prefers well-drained soils and is often associated with mixed evergreen and deciduous forests. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting local biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopanax leucorrhizus var. fulvescens was mainly introduced to regions with temperate to subtropical climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in forested areas and along stream banks, preferring partial to full shade. This plant has been introduced to parts of East Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, where it is used in traditional medicine. Its introduction has led to its naturalization in some areas, contributing to local biodiversity. However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it has been established."
