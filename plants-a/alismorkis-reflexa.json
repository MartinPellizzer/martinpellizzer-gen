    "intro": "Alismorkis reflexa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water plantain, is a semi-aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in wetlands, ponds, and along the edges of streams. The plant has slender, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in dense spikes and bloom in early summer. Alismorkis reflexa plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians."
