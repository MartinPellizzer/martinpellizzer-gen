    "intro": "Arenaria montana var. saxicola, commonly known as mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are generally narrow and covered with fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh climates. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas."
