It is found in the states of Esp\u00edrito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, and S\u00e3o Paulo. This plant typically grows in humid, tropical environments with well-drained soils. It is often found in secondary vegetation and disturbed areas within the region. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within the Atlantic Forest ecosystem.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema piresii was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in Brazil, as part of ecological restoration and ornamental horticulture efforts. It is commonly found in areas with disturbed soils and is often used in reforestation projects due to its rapid growth and adaptability. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it suitable for a variety of environmental conditions. Its introduction has been both beneficial for land recovery and a concern for native biodiversity in some regions. Despite its ecological value, careful management is required to prevent it from becoming invasive."
