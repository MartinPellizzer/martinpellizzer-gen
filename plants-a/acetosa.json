    "intro": "Acetosa, commonly known as common sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically reddish or purple underneath, and its small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant is known for its sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid in its leaves. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Acetosa has been used historically in herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
