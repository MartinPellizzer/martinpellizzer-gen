    "intro": "Asclepias lancifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of pink to reddish-orange flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many animals but serve as a defense mechanism. It plays a crucial role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae. Asclepias lancifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
