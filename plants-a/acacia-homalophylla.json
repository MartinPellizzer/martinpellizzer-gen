    "intro": "Acacia homalophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and narrow, feathery leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Acacia homalophylla is also valued for its role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia homalophylla is primarily native to eastern Australia, including regions such as New South Wales, Victoria, and parts of Queensland. It is commonly found in dry sclerophyll forests and open woodlands. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with rocky or sandy landscapes. It is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of southern Australia, characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. Acacia homalophylla plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia homalophylla was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of early European settlement and has since become naturalized in various regions. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas, often in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its adaptability, it has spread beyond its original introduction sites and is now considered a weed in some parts of the country."
