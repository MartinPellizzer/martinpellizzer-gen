    "intro": "Azorella hallei, commonly known as the Halle's azorella, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in cold, arid environments, often found in the Andes. The plant has a dense, cushion-like structure composed of tightly packed, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture. Its flowers are small and clustered in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Azorella hallei is adapted to harsh conditions, with a slow growth rate and the ability to survive extreme temperature fluctuations."
