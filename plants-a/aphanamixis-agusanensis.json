It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its unique morphology, including its broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, round fruits that are typically yellow when ripe. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts to protect its natural environment."
