    "intro": "Athyrium boryanum, commonly known as the Boryan fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the forests of East Asia. It features elegant, bipinnate fronds that are dark green and often have a slightly curled appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, preferring rich, well-drained soil. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Athyrium boryanum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various garden conditions."
