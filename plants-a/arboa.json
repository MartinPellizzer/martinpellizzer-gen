    "intro": "Arboa, commonly known as the desert willow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Bignoniaceae family and is characterized by its slender, willow-like branches and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are typically small and oval, and it produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Arboa is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
