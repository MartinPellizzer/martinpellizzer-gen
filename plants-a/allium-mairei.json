It features striking, spherical bulbs and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of pale pink to lilac flowers in late summer, which are arranged in umbels. Allium mairei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to many garden landscapes."
