It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves with a serrated edge. The leaves are typically blue-green in color and covered in a layer of white, powdery wax. It produces a tall flowering stalk that bears yellow flowers, which bloom in the summer months. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
