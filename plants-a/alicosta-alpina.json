    "intro": "Alicosta alpina, commonly known as the alpine alicosta, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a fine layer of silky hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh alpine environment. Alicosta alpina typically thrives at elevations above 1,500 meters, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife."
