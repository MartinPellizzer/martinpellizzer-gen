    "intro": "Agrostis palustris var. stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping bentgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass native to wet or moist environments. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 inches long and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its stoloniferous growth habit, which allows it to spread horizontally through runners. It thrives in well-drained to moist soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
