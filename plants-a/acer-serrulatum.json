    "intro": "Acer serrulatum, commonly known as the dissected maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely dissected, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in woodland habitats. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. Acer serrulatum is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often used in native plant landscaping.",
