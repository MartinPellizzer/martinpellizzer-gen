    "intro": "Amethystanthus taiwanensis, commonly known as the Taiwan amethyst flower, is a rare and striking plant native to Taiwan. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its unique, amethyst-colored bracts that resemble petals. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, contrasting with its vibrant bracts. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions of Taiwan. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
