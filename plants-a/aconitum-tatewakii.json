    "intro": "Aconitum tatewakii, commonly known as the Japanese monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Japan. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking purple to blue flowers that resemble a hood, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its leaves are palmately compound, with finely divided lobes, and its roots contain potent alkaloids. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.",
