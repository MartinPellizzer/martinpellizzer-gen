    "intro": "Arabidopsis tschuktschorum, commonly known as the Tschuktschorum mustard, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in cold climates. The plant is characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and rosette-like growth habit. It has a short life cycle, typically completing its growth and reproduction within a single growing season. Due to its genetic simplicity and rapid development, it is sometimes used in botanical research, though it is less studied than Arabidopsis thaliana."
