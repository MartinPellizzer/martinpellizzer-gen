    "intro": "Aspidoglossum kulsii, commonly known as the silver sword, is a striking member of the Asparagaceae family native to South Africa. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, silver-gray leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in summer. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in dry, well-drained garden soils."
