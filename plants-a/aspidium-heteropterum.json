    "intro": "Aspidium heteropterum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are typically divided into smaller, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Aspidium heteropterum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystems."
