    "intro": "Astragalus arenarius var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth sand milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant has hairy stems that become glabrous with age, and its leaves are pinnately compound with small, oval leaflets. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. This species plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
