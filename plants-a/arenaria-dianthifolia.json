    "intro": "Arenaria dianthifolia, commonly known as the pink sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are usually linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Arenaria dianthifolia is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in cold, nutrient-poor conditions."
