    "intro": "Anchonium tournefortii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that typically reaches heights of less than 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Anchonium tournefortii is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils."
