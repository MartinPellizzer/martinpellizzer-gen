    "intro": "Astragalus stridii, commonly known as the rough milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant has a deep taproot system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor and drought-prone environments. Astragalus stridii is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. This makes it an important plant in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
