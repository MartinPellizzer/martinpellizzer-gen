    "intro": "[WRONG START] Athyrium wardii var. inadaa, commonly known as the Inada's lady fern, is a fern species native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching in growth habit. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in shaded forest understories. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
