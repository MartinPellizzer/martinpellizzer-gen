    "intro": "Alchemilla saxatilis f. umbrosa, commonly known as the shade-loving lady's mantle, is a perennial plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, hairy leaves that are often grayish-green in color, providing a distinctive visual appeal. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it suitable for woodland gardens or shaded rock gardens. Its horticultural value lies in its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in less-than-ideal light conditions."
