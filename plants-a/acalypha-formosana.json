    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha formosana is primarily native to Taiwan, where it grows in moist, shaded forest environments. It is commonly found in the mountainous regions of the island, particularly in the central and eastern parts. This species thrives in humid climates and is often associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats. It is also occasionally reported in southern China and the Philippines, though these populations may be introduced rather than native. The plant is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha formosana was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and unique growth habits. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions where it is cultivated for its aesthetic value. The plant has been reported in several countries, including the United States, Australia, and parts of Southeast Asia. However, it is not considered an invasive species in most areas where it is grown. Its distribution is largely limited to managed landscapes and gardens."
