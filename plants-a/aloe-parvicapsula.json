    "intro": "Aloe parvicapsula, commonly known as the dwarf aloe or miniature aloe, is a small, succulent plant native to South Africa. It features compact rosettes of fleshy, green leaves with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers on slender stalks during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves. Aloe parvicapsula is popular as a low-maintenance houseplant due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
