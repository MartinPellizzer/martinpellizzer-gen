It is characterized by its long, narrow, sword-shaped fronds that are typically green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Adiantum ensifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.",
