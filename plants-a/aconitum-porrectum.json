    "intro": "Aconitum porrectum, commonly known as the European aconite or monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, arranged in a helmet-like shape. The plant has dark green, deeply lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of pubescence. Aconitum porrectum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and meadows. It contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling.",
