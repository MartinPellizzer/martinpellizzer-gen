    "intro": "Astragalus rumelicus subsp. taygeticus, commonly known as the Taygetic locoweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the western United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to low-nutrient soils. This subspecies is part of the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria."
