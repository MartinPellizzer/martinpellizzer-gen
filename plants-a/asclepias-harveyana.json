It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of bright orange to yellow flowers. The plant features a milky sap, which is a common trait among milkweed species. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, often with a hairy texture. Harvey's milkweed serves as a critical host plant for the monarch butterfly, supporting the life cycle of this iconic species."
