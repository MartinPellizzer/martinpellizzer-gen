    "intro": "Alchornea cerifera, commonly known as waxleaf alchornea, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, waxy leaves that provide a striking visual contrast to its pale green stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by pale pink to white berries. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its aesthetic appeal. Alchornea cerifera is also valued for its ability to tolerate partial shade and its use in traditional medicine in some regions."
