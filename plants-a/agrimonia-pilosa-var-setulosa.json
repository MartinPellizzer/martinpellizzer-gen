It features upright, branching stems covered in fine, bristly hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, rounded clusters called cymes. Its leaves are pinnately divided with serrated edges, and they are covered in fine, stiff hairs. Agrimony is often found in disturbed soils and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies."
