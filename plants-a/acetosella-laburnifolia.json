    "intro": "Acetosella laburnifolia, commonly known as the golden mountain sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, erect stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Acetosella laburnifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.",
