    "intro": "Astragalus polycladus var. glabricarpus, commonly known as the smoothpod milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish to pale green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces smooth, hairy-less pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, shrublands, and along disturbed areas. Due to its adaptability and ecological importance, it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife."
