    "intro": "Agave palmeri, commonly known as the Palmer's agave, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a succulent plant characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears clusters of white or yellow flowers, which appear after several years of growth. Agave palmeri is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally by indigenous peoples for various purposes."
