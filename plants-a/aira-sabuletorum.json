    "intro": "Aira sabuletorum, commonly known as the sand airgrass, is a perennial grass species native to sandy and coastal environments. It is characterized by its low-growing, clump-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or other disturbed sandy habitats. Due to its adaptability, it plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion."
