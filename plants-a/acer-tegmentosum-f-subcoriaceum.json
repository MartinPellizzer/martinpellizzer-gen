    "intro": "Acer tegmentosum f. subcoriaceum, commonly known as the smooth maple or subcoriaceum maple, is a variant of the paper maple species. It is characterized by its smooth, thin, and often slightly hairy leaves that are typically oval to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability in both natural and cultivated settings.",
