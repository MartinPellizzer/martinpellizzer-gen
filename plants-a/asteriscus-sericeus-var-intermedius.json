    "intro": "Asteriscus sericeus var. intermedius, commonly known as the silverleaf asterisk, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to the southwestern United States. It features silvery-gray foliage due to dense, fine hairs covering its leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a desirable plant for rock gardens and drought-tolerant landscapes."
