    "intro": "Asplenium hondoense, commonly known as Hondo's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the island of Hondo in the Philippines. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and covered in a fine layer of trichomes. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its primitive sporangia arrangement. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
