    "intro": "Achillea borealis f. fusca, commonly known as the dark alpine yarrow, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of North America. It features dense, silver-gray foliage with a woolly texture, and its flowers are typically small, pale yellow to white, appearing in flat-topped clusters. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is often found in alpine tundras and mountain meadows, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with similar growing conditions.",
