It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds. Alsinella occidentalis is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils and can tolerate drought conditions."
