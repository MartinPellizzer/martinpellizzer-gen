    "intro": "Athyrium pinnatifidum, commonly known as the Japanese painted fern, is a fern species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, lacy fronds that give it a delicate and ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine in some Asian countries. The fronds are usually biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year of growth."
