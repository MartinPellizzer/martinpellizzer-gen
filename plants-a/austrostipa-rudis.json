    "intro": "Austrostipa rudis, commonly known as the slender wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Austrostipa rudis has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water conservation. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small fauna in its native range."
