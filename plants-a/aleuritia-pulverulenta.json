    "intro": "Aleuritia pulverulenta, commonly known as the Chinese snowberry, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It features small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces bright red berries that are edible but have a mild, slightly sweet flavor. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal interest throughout the year."
