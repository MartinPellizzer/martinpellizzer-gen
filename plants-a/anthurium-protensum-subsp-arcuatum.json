It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a reddish or purple underside. The plant produces vibrant, spadix-shaped inflorescences surrounded by a colorful spathe, typically in shades of red or orange. It thrives in humid, warm environments with indirect light and requires well-draining soil. This species is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
