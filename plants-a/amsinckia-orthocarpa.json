    "intro": "Amsinckia orthocarpa, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that grows in arid and semi-arid environments, typically found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. The plant is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a hardy species adapted to harsh desert climates."
