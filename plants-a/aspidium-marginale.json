    "intro": "Aspidium marginale, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it attaches to submerged or partially submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the surrounding water. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in wetland habitats."
