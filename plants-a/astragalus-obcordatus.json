    "intro": "Astragalus obcordatus, commonly known as the heartleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are deeply divided into five to seven lobes resembling a heart shape. The plant produces small, yellow to greenish-yellow flowers arranged in racemes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Astragalus obcordatus is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
