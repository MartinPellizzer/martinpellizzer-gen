It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant produces follicles containing toxic alkaloids, which are similar to those found in other members of the aconite genus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care.",
