    "intro": "Artanthe galeottii, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for arid environments. Artanthe galeottii plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats."
