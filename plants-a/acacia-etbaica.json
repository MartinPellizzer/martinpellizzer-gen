    "intro": "Acacia etbaica, commonly known as the Eritrean acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Horn of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often thornless branches and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small leaflets. The plant produces yellow or pale green globular flower heads, which are arranged in compact clusters. Acacia etbaica is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in dry regions. It plays a role in local ecosystems and has been used traditionally for various purposes.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia etbaica is primarily native to the Ethiopian highlands, specifically the areas around the Rift Valley and the southern parts of the country. It is commonly found in semi-arid and subhumid regions, growing in rocky soils and on slopes. This plant is well adapted to the local climate and plays an important role in the ecosystem of its native habitat. It is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Acacia etbaica is often used for its timber and as a source of fodder for livestock in the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia etbaica was mainly introduced to areas with arid and semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Ethiopia and Eritrea, where it plays an important role in local ecosystems. The plant is often used for its timber, fuelwood, and as a source of fodder for livestock. Due to its hardiness, it has been introduced to other parts of Africa for reforestation and land rehabilitation efforts. However, its introduction has also led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in new environments."
