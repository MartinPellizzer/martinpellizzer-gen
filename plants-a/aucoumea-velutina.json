    "intro": "Aucoumea velutina, commonly known as the velvet wood or velvet tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba and Hispaniola. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark brown bark that becomes flaky with age. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, elliptical berries. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its common name. Aucoumea velutina is valued for its durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture making."
