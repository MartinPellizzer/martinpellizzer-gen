    "intro": "Astragalus mongholicus, commonly known as the Mongolian milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the grasslands of northern China and Mongolia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces cylindrical, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus mongholicus is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
