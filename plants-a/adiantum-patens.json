It features finely divided, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green and turn bronze in the winter. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. It reproduces via spores and is often grown as a houseplant or in shaded garden beds. Its unique appearance and easy care make it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardening.",
