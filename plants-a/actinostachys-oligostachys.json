    "intro": "Actinostachys oligostachys, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically narrow and arching. The plant produces small, clustered spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to botanical gardens and a subject of interest in studies of tropical flora.",
