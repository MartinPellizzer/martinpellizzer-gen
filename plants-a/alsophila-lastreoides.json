    "intro": "Alsophila lastreoides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a short, rhizomatous stem with dense, clustered fronds that are lanceolate in shape. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid conditions. Alsophila lastreoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, evergreen foliage."
