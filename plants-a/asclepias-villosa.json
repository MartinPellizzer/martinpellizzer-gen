    "intro": "Asclepias villosa, commonly known as the woolly milkweed, is a native North American plant belonging to the Apocynaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of pink to reddish-orange flowers that attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Its unique seed pods contain silky, white filaments that aid in wind dispersal of its seeds. Asclepias villosa plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing a host for their larvae."
