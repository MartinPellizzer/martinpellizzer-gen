    "intro": "Atylosia scarabaeoides var. queenslandica, commonly known as the Queensland ironwood, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous bark and evergreen foliage, which gives it a rugged appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in spring. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species. Due to its slow growth and durability, it is often used in landscaping and for erosion control."
