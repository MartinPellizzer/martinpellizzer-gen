    "intro": "Arenaria capillaris var. glandulosissima, commonly known as the glandular sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense clusters of tiny, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine, glandular hairs, which give the plant its varietal name. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
