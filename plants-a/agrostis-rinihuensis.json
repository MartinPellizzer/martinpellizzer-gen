    "intro": "Agrostis rinihuensis, commonly known as the Rinihu grass, is a species of grass native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native invertebrates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native range."
