    "intro": "Adenostoma sparsifolium, commonly known as the coastal buckwheat, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and showy clusters of white to pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds, and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are small, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Adenostoma sparsifolium plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
