    "intro": "Alchemilla bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It features a dense rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of silky, whitish hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Alchemilla bakeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
