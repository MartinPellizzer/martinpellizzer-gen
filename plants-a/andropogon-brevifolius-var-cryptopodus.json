    "intro": "Andropogon brevifolius var. cryptopodus, commonly known as the cryptopodal bluestem, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are typically shorter than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and prairies. Its growth habit makes it a valuable component of native grassland ecosystems."
