    "intro": "Aira cespitosa var. altissima, commonly known as tall false grass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
