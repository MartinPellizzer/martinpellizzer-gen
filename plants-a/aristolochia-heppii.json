    "intro": "Aristolochia heppii, commonly known as the Chinese birthwort, is a climbing vine native to East Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves and produces intricate, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, unpleasant odor. The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic and have been linked to severe kidney damage. It is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and stream sides. Due to its toxicity, it is not recommended for cultivation or consumption."
