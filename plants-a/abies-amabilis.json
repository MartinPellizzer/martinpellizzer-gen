    "intro": "Abies amabilis, commonly known as the Pacific silver fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-blue needles and tall, slender form, often reaching heights of up to 60 meters. The tree produces cones that are typically 5 to 8 centimeters long, containing winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thin and reddish-brown, becoming more fissured with age. The Pacific silver fir is adapted to moist, temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions.",

This species is commonly found in the coastal and mountainous regions of these areas. It thrives in temperate rainforests and moist, well-drained soils. The tree is known for its pyramidal shape and attractive blue-green needles. It plays an important ecological role in the forests of the Pacific Northwest.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies amabilis was mainly introduced to Great Britain as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to temperate climates. It is commonly found in gardens and parks, where it serves as a decorative evergreen. The species is valued for its pyramidal shape and attractive foliage, making it a popular choice for landscaping. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems. Despite these concerns, it remains a favored plant in British horticulture."
