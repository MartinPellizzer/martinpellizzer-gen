    "intro": "Anaphalis margaritacea var. angustior, commonly known as the narrowleaf goatweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a spherical cluster, giving it a fluffy appearance. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in semi-desert and coastal regions."
