    "intro": "Acrostichum nummulariifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, round, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid rainforests. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are typically bioluminescent at night, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.",
