    "intro": "Aira major, commonly known as the tall false brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces panicle-like inflorescences with small, spikelet-based flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Botanically, it is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to form dense stands in suitable environments."
