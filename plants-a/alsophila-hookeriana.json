    "intro": "Alsophila hookeriana, commonly known as the Hooker's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant belongs to the family Dicksoniaceae and is closely related to other tree ferns such as Cyathea. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. Alsophila hookeriana thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas."
