    "intro": "Agrostis erecta, commonly known as upright bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spikelet-based inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Agrostis erecta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass management."
