    "intro": "Arenaria portulacea, commonly known as sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. The plant has small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. It is often considered a weed but has historical uses in herbal medicine."
