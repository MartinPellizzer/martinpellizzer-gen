    "intro": "Arctostaphylos vestita, commonly known as the whiteleaf manzanita, is a shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, sticky seeds. Arctostaphylos vestita is well adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub ecosystems."
