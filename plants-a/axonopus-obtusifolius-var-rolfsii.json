    "intro": "Axonopus obtusifolius var. rolfsii, commonly known as Florida carpetgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing foliage with narrow, flat leaves that have a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland areas, lawns, and disturbed sites. This variant is known for its ability to form dense mats, which can help prevent erosion but is also considered a weed in some landscapes."
