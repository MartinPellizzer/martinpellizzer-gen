    "intro": "Artemisia rupestris var. viridis, commonly known as green stonecress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, which contribute to its distinctive scent and medicinal properties. It is typically low-growing, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion."
