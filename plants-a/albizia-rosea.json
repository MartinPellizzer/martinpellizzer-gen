    "intro": "Albizia rosea, commonly known as the silky senna, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that are clustered in racemes, adding a vibrant touch to its appearance. Albizia rosea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
