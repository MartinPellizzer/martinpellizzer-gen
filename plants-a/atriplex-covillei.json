    "intro": "Atriplex covillei, commonly known as Coville's saltbush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are often hidden among the leaves. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it a common species in desert and semi-desert regions. Atriplex covillei plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various desert wildlife."
