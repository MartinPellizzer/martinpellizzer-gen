    "intro": "Astragalus newberryi, commonly known as Newberry's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife. Due to its limited range and vulnerability to habitat loss, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
