    "intro": "Argyreia atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant is a climbing vine that can grow up to 10 meters in length, with tendrils that help it ascend supports. Its flowers are typically tubular with a spurred base, and they emit a mild fragrance. The seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, orange-red capsule that splits open when mature."
