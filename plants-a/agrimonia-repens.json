    "intro": "Agrimonia repens, commonly known as common agrimony, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges and a slightly hairy texture. Agrimonia repens is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
