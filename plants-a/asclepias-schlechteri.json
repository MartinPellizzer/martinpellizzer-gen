    "intro": "Asclepias schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, butterfly-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces a milky sap, which is typical of the genus Asclepias and contains toxic compounds. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This species plays a vital role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae."
