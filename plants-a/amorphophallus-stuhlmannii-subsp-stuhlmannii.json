    "intro": "Amorphophallus stuhlmannii subsp. stuhlmannii, commonly known as the giant titan arum, is a member of the Araceae family and is native to the rainforests of western Africa. It is renowned for its massive, spatulate leaves that can grow up to 5 meters in length, which are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces a striking inflorescence with a large, purple spathe and a central, yellowish spadix, which can emit a strong odor resembling rotting flesh. This characteristic is an adaptation to attract pollinators such as flies and beetles. It is a herbaceous perennial that undergoes a period of dormancy, during which it stores energy in its underground corm."
