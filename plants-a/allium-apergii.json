    "intro": "Allium apergii, commonly known as the Persian onion or wild leek, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia and the Middle East. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single, tall flower stalk that bears a cluster of small, white or pale purple flowers. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, onion-like flavor, making it a valued ingredient in some traditional cuisines. Allium apergii is also cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
