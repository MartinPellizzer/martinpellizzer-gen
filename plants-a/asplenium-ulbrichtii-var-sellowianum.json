    "intro": "Asplenium ulbrichtii var. sellowianum, commonly known as the Sellow's spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant, typically found growing on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often clustered at the base, with a delicate, feathery appearance. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it produces spores rather than seeds. This variety is relatively rare and is often appreciated for its ornamental value in specialized horticulture."
