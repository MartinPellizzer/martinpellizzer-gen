    "intro": "Antheidosorus, commonly known as the fern moss, is a member of the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is a small, delicate plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant features intricate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in tiny, hair-like structures. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, cup-like formations on the undersides of the fronds. Antheidosorus plays a vital role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms."
