    "intro": "Acalypha spachiana var. minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or swampy areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions.",

It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with rainforest understories. It is also present in parts of the Philippines and New Guinea. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other tropical regions around the world.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha spachiana var. minor was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was first documented in the early 20th century and has since become established in several regions. The plant is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and vacant lots, where it can thrive in a variety of soil types. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction have contributed to its spread. However, it is not considered invasive in most areas where it is found."
