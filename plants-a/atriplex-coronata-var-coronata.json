    "intro": "Atriplex coronata var. coronata, commonly known as desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, adapting to harsh, saline environments. The plant produces small greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are often concealed by the foliage. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater in dry soils. This species plays a vital role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
