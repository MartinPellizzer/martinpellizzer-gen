    "intro": "Acaena cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved burr bush, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and spiny, bristly fruits. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the development of persistent, spherical burrs. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a distinctive cuneate base. Acaena cuneata is often found in coastal and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena cuneata is primarily native to South America, specifically Chile and Argentina. It is commonly found in the temperate regions of these countries. This plant typically grows in grasslands, shrublands, and coastal areas. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often part of the native vegetation in these ecosystems. Acaena cuneata is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in supporting native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena cuneata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as a decorative plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation in certain areas. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can tolerate both full sun and partial shade. Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to disrupt local ecosystems."
