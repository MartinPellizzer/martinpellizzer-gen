    "intro": "Aspidium conterminum var. asperulum, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a variant of the common holly fern native to eastern North America. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a creeping rhizome with clusters of lance-shaped, dark green fronds that have a rough, textured surface. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
