    "intro": "Asplenium zoliense, commonly known as the Zoli's spleenwort, is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae). It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic fern that typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often clustered at the base, with a distinctive, delicate appearance. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Asplenium zoliense is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich substrates."
