    "intro": "Artemisia japonica f. vestita, commonly known as the Japanese mugwort or velvet wormwood, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late summer, arranged in narrow, branched clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its aromatic properties, it has been used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb in some cultures."
