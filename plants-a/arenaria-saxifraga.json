    "intro": "Arenaria saxifraga, commonly known as sandpink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and sandy habitats in Europe and Asia. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its root system is adapted to anchor it in loose, gravelly soils. Arenaria saxifraga is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
