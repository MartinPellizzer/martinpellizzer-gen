    "intro": "Aloe triangularis, commonly known as the triangular aloe or the saw tooth aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically triangular in cross-section, giving it its common name. The leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps the plant retain moisture in arid environments. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow to orange flowers during the summer months. The plant is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and attractive appearance."
