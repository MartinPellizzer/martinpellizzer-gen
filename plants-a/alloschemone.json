    "intro": "Alloschemone, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in saline environments and is often found along shorelines and in tidal zones. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Alloschemone is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens."
