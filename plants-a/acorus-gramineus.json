    "intro": "Acorus gramineus, commonly known as narrow-leaf sweetflag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features long, narrow, grass-like leaves that grow from a rhizomatous stem, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in early summer, which are typically clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Acorus gramineus thrives in moist to aquatic environments, making it a common sight in marshes, ponds, and along stream banks. It is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine.",
