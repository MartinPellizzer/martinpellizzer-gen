    "intro": "Arenaria montana var. linearifolia, commonly known as mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh mountainous conditions."
