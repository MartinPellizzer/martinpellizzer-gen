    "intro": "Astragalus caprinus subsp. lanigerus, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, alpine environments. Its leaves are compound, with numerous small leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soils in arid and semi-arid habitats."
