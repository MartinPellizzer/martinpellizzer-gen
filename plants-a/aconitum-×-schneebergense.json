    "intro": "Aconitum \u00d7 schneebergense, commonly known as the Schneeberg monkshood, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the Alps. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet hooded flowers that resemble a bishop's mitre, typical of the genus Aconitum. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring dark green, palmately lobed leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which occurs in late summer to early autumn.",
