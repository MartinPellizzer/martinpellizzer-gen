It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, often hairy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually linear and covered with fine, stiff hairs, while the flowers are yellow and bloom in late spring to early summer. The variety spinosus is distinguished by its spiny bracts, which provide protection to the developing seeds."
