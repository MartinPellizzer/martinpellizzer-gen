It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, harsh environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
