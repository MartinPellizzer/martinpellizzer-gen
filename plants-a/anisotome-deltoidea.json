    "intro": "Anisotome deltoidea, commonly known as the delta leaf grass, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with a distinctive deltoid (triangle-shaped) base. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its ornamental foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its unique leaf shape."
