It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. This variant is distinguished by its unique morphological traits and geographic distribution compared to other Astragalus species."
