    "intro": "Agrostis nana var. aristata, commonly known as the tufted meadowgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed sites. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
