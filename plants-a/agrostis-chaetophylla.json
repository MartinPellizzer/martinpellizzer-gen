    "intro": "Agrostis chaetophylla, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically forms dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or arctic environments. It has narrow, linear leaves with prominent veins and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Agrostis chaetophylla is adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient component of mountainous and tundra ecosystems."
