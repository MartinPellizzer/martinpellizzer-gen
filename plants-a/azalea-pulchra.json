    "intro": "Azalea pulchra, commonly known as the beauty azalea, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rhododendron genus and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to 6 feet, with dense, leathery leaves that provide year-round foliage. Azalea pulchra thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its blooms, which appear in spring, are not only ornamental but also attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
