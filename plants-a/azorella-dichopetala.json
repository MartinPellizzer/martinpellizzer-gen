    "intro": "Azorella dichopetala, commonly known as the Andean snowbean, is a perennial cushion plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae and is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosette of fleshy, lobed leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Azorella dichopetala is adapted to cold, arid environments and can survive in extreme conditions due to its compact growth form and thick, water-storing leaves. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest for its potential medicinal properties."
