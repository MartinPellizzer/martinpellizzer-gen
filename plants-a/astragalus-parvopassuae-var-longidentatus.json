    "intro": "Astragalus parvopassuae var. longidentatus, commonly known as the long-toothed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
