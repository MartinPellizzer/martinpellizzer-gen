    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthospermum hispidum is primarily native to Argentina Northeast, Argentina Northwest, Bolivia, Brazil North, Brazil Northeast, Brazil South, Brazil Southeast, Brazil West-Central, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Leeward Is., Netherlands Antilles, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Peru, Puerto Rico, Suriname, Trinidad-Tobago, Venezuela, and Windward Is. This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these areas. It thrives in open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. It is often associated with disturbed or secondary vegetation. Its wide distribution suggests adaptability to various environmental conditions within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthospermum hispidum was mainly introduced to regions across Africa, Asia, and the Americas, including countries such as Alabama, Angola, Bangladesh, Belgium, and Florida. It has been reported in diverse habitats ranging from coastal areas to inland regions, indicating its adaptability to various environmental conditions. The plant's introduction spans multiple continents, suggesting either natural dispersal or human-assisted spread through trade or horticultural activities. It is particularly common in tropical and subtropical zones, where it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. This widespread distribution highlights its ecological significance and potential impact on local ecosystems."
