    "intro": "Asplenium xinjiangense, commonly known as Xinjiang spleenwort, is a rare fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its spores are dispersed through wind, and it reproduces primarily through spore production rather than seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
