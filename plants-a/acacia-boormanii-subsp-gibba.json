    "intro": "Acacia boormanii subsp. gibba, commonly known as the knob thorn, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive knobby, thickened stems that give it its common name. The plant produces yellow, fluffy flowers in late winter to early spring, which are followed by pods containing edible seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of many small, thread-like leaflets. The species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it resilient to drought and heat.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia boormanii subsp. gibba is primarily native to Victoria. It is found in the eastern regions of Victoria, Australia. This subspecies thrives in dry, sandy soils and is commonly found in open woodlands and heathlands. It is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. The plant plays an important role in local ecosystems and is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia boormanii subsp. gibba was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries like South Africa, Namibia, and Mozambique. It was introduced primarily for its ornamental value due to its unique, rounded thorns and attractive foliage. The plant has also been used in reforestation projects because of its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. However, it has become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact."
