    "intro": "Agrostis noveboracensis, commonly known as New York bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the northeastern United States. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along the edges of ponds. Botanically, it is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and its ability to tolerate periodic flooding."
