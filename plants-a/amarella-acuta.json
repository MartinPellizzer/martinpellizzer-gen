    "intro": "Amarella acuta, commonly known as the sharp-leafed amarella, is a herbaceous plant native to certain regions of South America. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a pointed tip, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its fruits are small, berry-like structures that mature to a bright red color, attracting various pollinators and seed dispersers. Amarella acuta is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks."
