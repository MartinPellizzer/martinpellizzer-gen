    "intro": "Androsace lactea, commonly known as the milky rock jasmine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair. Androsace lactea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny conditions."
