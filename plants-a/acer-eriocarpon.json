    "intro": "Acer eriocarpon, commonly known as the woolly maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy (woolly) young shoots and leaves that are typically opposite and have a serrated margin. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red, fuzzy fruits that contain small, dark seeds. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, often growing in cool, moist environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems.",
