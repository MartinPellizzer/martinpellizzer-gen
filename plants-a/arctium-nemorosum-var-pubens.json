    "intro": "Arctium nemorosum var. pubens, commonly known as the pubescent hogweed, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems covered in dense, soft pubescence. The plant produces large, umbrella-shaped clusters of small, greenish-white flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and have a distinctive, lobed structure with coarse teeth. This variant is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in moist, temperate climates."
