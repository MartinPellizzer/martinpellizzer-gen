    "intro": "Asplenium subsinuatum, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves. Asplenium subsinuatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitats."
