    "intro": "Agrostis dshungarica, commonly known as the Siberian meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia, including parts of Russia and China. It typically grows in open, moist habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, tufted blades with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization. Agrostis dshungarica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
