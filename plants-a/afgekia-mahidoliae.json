    "intro": "Afgekia mahidoliae, commonly known as the Mahidolia afgekia, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of Namibia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its distinctive, feathery foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Afgekia mahidoliae is considered endangered and is protected under local conservation laws."
