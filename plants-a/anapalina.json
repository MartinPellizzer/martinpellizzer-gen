    "intro": "Anapalina, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Anapalina is native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. It is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
