    "intro": "Anathallis graveolens, commonly known as the stinking ghost orchid, is a rare and unique epiphytic orchid native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its pale green, leaf-like stems and small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is named for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is thought to attract specific pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is a subject of conservation efforts."
