    "intro": "Aetopteron aculeatum var. coraiense, commonly known as the Coraiense thornplant, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense clusters of small, spiny leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are typically elliptical with sharp, pointed tips, contributing to its defensive adaptations. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories."
