    "intro": "Acer rufinerve albolimbata, commonly known as the white-veined maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern China. It is characterized by its distinctive white veins on its heart-shaped leaves, which contrast sharply with its dark green foliage. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic features.",
