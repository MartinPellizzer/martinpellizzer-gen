    "intro": "Astragalus chapalanus, commonly known as the Chapalane milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Astragalus chapalanus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
