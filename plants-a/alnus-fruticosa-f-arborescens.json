    "intro": "Alnus fruticosa f. arborescens, commonly known as the dwarf alder, is a shrub-like variety of the alder genus native to northern Europe. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are typically alternate and dark green in color. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration projects."
