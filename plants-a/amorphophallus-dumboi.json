    "intro": "Amorphophallus dumboi, commonly known as the giant elephant's foot, is a striking plant native to the rainforests of western Africa. It is characterized by its massive, bulbous underground tuber, which can weigh several kilograms and resemble a giant foot. The plant produces a tall, spire-like inflorescence with large, white flowers that emit a strong, unpleasant odor, attracting pollinators like flies. Its unique morphology and dramatic blooming cycle make it a subject of interest in botanical studies. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered endangered in its native range."
