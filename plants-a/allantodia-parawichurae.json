    "intro": "Allantodia parawichurae, commonly known as the Parawichurae Allantodia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, elongated fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
