    "intro": "Asperula cynanchica var. saxatilis, commonly known as the rock asperula, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, dark green, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue to violet flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, elliptical berries. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in coastal or alpine environments. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to tolerate harsh conditions, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
