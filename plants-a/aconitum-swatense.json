    "intro": "Aconitum swatense, commonly known as the Swat aconite, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Pakistan. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features a thick, short rhizome and has palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is cultivated in gardens but requires caution due to its potent alkaloid content.",
