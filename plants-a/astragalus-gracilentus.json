    "intro": "Astragalus gracilentus, commonly known as slender milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers that range from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has a deep taproot system, which allows it to survive in arid conditions and makes it drought-tolerant. Astragalus gracilentus is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in native landscapes."
