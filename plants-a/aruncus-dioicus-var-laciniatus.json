It features striking, feathery, fern-like foliage that is often described as resembling the plumes of a peacock. The plant produces showy, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a spathe, which are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a dramatic, native plant for shaded landscapes."
