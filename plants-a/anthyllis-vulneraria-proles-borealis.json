    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria proles borealis, commonly known as the northern woundwort, is a flowering plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a low-growing habit, with hairy stems and small, trifoliate leaves that help it retain heat in cold environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. This species plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its harsh native environment."
