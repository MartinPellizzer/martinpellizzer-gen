    "intro": "Artemisia vahliana, commonly known as sand artemisia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. It has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Artemisia vahliana is often used in traditional medicine and for soil stabilization in ecological restoration projects."
