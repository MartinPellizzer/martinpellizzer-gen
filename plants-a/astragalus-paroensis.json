    "intro": "Astragalus paroensis, commonly known as the Paro milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the Himalayas, particularly in Nepal and Bhutan. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its trifoliate leaves are pinnately compound, and it produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. Astragalus paroensis plays a role in local ecosystems by contributing to soil stabilization and providing nectar for pollinators."
