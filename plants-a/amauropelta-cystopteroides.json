    "intro": "Amauropelta cystopteroides, commonly known as the small shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that often form a compact rosette. The plant has a unique morphology with a short, thick rhizome and leaves that are typically divided into two pairs of lobes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Amauropelta cystopteroides thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
