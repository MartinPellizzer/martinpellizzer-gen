    "intro": "Apinella frigida, commonly known as the cold-loving orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to high-altitude regions in the Andes. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to withstand frost and low temperatures. The plant produces small, pale green or white flowers with a subtle fragrance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine, silvery hair. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Apinella frigida is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
