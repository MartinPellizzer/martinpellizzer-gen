    "intro": "Aster miser var. abbreviatus, commonly known as the short-stemmed aster, is a herbaceous perennial native to the northeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that are often shorter than those of its parent species, Aster miser. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is well adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland habitats."
