    "intro": "Agrostis polymorpha var. sylvatica, commonly known as woodland bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths on well-drained soils, often in woodland or shaded areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for ornamental purposes due to its fine texture and ability to thrive in partial shade. This variety is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations."
