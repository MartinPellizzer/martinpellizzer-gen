    "intro": "Alopecurus castellanus, commonly known as mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Alopecurus castellanus is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a characteristic species of calcareous grasslands."
