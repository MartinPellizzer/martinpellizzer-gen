    "intro": "Asplenium annetii, commonly known as the Annet's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly found in humid, shaded environments such as on tree trunks or rocks. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth form with finely divided, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically located on the underside of the leaves, which is characteristic of many ferns. Asplenium annetii thrives in moist, nutrient-rich substrates and requires high humidity and indirect light for optimal growth."
