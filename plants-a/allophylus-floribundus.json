    "intro": "Allophylus floribundus, commonly known as the clustered holly, is a deciduous shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters and features simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters during the summer months, followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture due to its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes. Allophylus floribundus is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to partial shade."
