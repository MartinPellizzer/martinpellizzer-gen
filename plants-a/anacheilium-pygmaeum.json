    "intro": "Anacheilium pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf anacheilium, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, while its stems are slender and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
