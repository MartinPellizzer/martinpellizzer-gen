    "intro": "Almeidea limae, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its trumpet-shaped, pale blue to violet flowers that open in the early morning and close by midday. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in areas with high salt exposure. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine, hairy structures that help reduce water loss. Almeidea limae is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens along coastal regions."
