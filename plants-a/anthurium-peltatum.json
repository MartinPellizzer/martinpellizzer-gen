    "intro": "Anthurium peltatum, commonly known as the velvet leaf anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces striking spadices, which are the modified leaves that enclose the true flowers. Anthurium peltatum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. It is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental foliage."
