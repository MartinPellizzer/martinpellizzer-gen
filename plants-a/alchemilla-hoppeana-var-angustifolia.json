    "intro": "Alchemilla hoppeana var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a dense rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
