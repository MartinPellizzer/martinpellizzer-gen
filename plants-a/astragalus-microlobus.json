    "intro": "Astragalus microlobus, commonly known as the small-lobed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, compound leaves that are typically hairy. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, globular inflorescences. Astragalus microlobus is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria."
