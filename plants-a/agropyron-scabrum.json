    "intro": "Agropyron scabrum, commonly known as rough fescue, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats or tufts. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, including roadsides, fields, and rocky areas, and is adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions. Its seed heads are spike-like, and the plant is known for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils. Agropyron scabrum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
