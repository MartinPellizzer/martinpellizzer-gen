    "intro": "Andropogon nodosus, commonly known as nodding grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that nod downward, giving it its common name. The plant has narrow, linear leaves with a prominent midrib and produces small, pale blue or purple flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Botanically, it is part of the Poaceae family and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
