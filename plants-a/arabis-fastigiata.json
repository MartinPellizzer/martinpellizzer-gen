    "intro": "Arabis fastigiata, commonly known as the upright rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are linear and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Arabis fastigiata is often used in rock gardens and alpine settings due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
