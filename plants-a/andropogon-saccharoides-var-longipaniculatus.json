    "intro": "Andropogon saccharoides var. longipaniculatus, commonly known as the longpanicle bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, branched inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in swamps, marshes, and along waterways. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spikelet-based flowers in late summer. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for wildlife."
