    "intro": "Aralia acutifolia, commonly known as the sharp-leaved aralia, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It features compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with individual leaflets that are often sharply pointed, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clustered inflorescences, which are typically followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Aralia acutifolia is valued in horticulture for its attractive foliage and ornamental appeal."
