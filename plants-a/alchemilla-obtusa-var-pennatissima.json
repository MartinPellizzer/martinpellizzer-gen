    "intro": "Alchemilla obtusa var. pennatissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features distinctive, velvety, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, often with a pale green or silver underside. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months, which are borne on tall, slender stalks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a popular choice for shady garden borders. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate wet conditions, making it suitable for bog gardens or water features."
