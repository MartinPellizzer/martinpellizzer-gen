    "intro": "Androsace puberulenta, commonly known as the woolly arete, is a low-growing alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features dense, hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture and withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, often blooming in early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in rocky or gravelly soils. Androsace puberulenta is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
