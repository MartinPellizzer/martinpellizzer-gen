    "intro": "Astomatopsis, commonly known as the \"ghost flower,\" is a unique plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate, and often translucent leaves that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant is notable for its lack of stomata on its leaves, a rare botanical feature that distinguishes it from most other plants in its family. Astomatopsis thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unusual morphology and limited distribution make it an intriguing subject for botanical study."
