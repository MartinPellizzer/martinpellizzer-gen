    "intro": "Arctostaphylos mucronifera, commonly known as the Sierra foothill manzanita, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, urn-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its slow growth rate and long lifespan make it a valuable component of chaparral and woodland ecosystems."
