    "intro": "Athyrium opacum var. glabrescens, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a striking fern species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are covered in a fine, velvety texture, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside."
