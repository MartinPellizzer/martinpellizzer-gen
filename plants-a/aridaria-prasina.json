It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces small, white flowers during the rainy season, which attract pollinators. Its root system is extensive, enabling it to access deep underground moisture. Aridaria prasina plays a vital role in stabilizing desert soils and supporting local wildlife."
