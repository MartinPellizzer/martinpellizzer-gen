    "intro": "Ammodenia maxima, commonly known as the coastal flax or sea flax, is a perennial shrub native to the western coast of North America. It typically grows in coastal dunes and sandy soils, thriving in salty, windy environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. Its fibrous stems are valued for their strength and have been used traditionally by indigenous peoples. Ammodenia maxima plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
