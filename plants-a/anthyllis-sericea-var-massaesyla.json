    "intro": "Anthyllis sericea var. massaesyla, commonly known as the silky anthyllis, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its finely hairy, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
