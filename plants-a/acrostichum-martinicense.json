    "intro": "Acrostichum martinicense, commonly known as the Martinique fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its feathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The leaves are usually evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to its natural habitat.",
