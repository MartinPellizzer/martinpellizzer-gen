    "intro": "Acer saccharophorum var. schneckii, commonly known as the Schneck's sugar maple, is a variant of the sugar maple native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, clustered flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, developing shallow furrows with age. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often planted in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal.",
