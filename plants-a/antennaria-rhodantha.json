It belongs to the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is characterized by its dense clusters of tiny, pink to red flowers. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with slender, branched stems and small, hairy leaves. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Antennaria rhodantha is adapted to cold climates and is an important component of high-elevation ecosystems."
