It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, leaf-like bracts that enclose the spadix, a spike of small flowers. The plant produces a tuberous root that is used as a starch source in some local cuisines. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated for both aesthetic and practical purposes."
