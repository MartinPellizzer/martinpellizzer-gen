    "intro": "Acer heldreichii f. macropterum, commonly known as the large-winged maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its distinctive palmately lobed leaves, which are typically large and have prominent, broad wing-like lobes. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse its seeds. Its bark is smooth and greyish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal interest.",
