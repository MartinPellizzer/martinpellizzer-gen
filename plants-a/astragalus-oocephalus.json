    "intro": "Astragalus oocephalus, commonly known as the narrow-headed milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. It has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus oocephalus is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability in arid environments."
