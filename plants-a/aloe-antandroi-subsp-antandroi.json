    "intro": "Aloe antandroi subsp. antandroi, commonly known as the Natal aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain water in arid conditions. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellowish-orange flowers, which are attractive to pollinators. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their soothing properties. This species is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
