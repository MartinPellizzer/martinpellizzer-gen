    "intro": "Aspidium glabratum, commonly known as the smooth water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and have a smooth, glossy appearance. The plant prefers moist, shady environments and is often found in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and contain spores for propagation. Aspidium glabratum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
