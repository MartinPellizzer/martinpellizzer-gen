    "intro": "Amaranthus retroflexus subsp. delilei, commonly known as redroot amaranth, is a flowering plant in the amaranth family (Amaranthaceae). It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive reddish stems, which are often more prominent than in other subspecies. The plant produces small, clustered green flowers that are followed by triangular, three-angled seed capsules. It is native to parts of Africa and has been introduced to other regions, including the Americas. This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
