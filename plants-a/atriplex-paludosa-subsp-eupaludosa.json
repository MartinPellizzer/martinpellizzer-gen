It is characterized by its succulent, lobed leaves that help reduce water loss in arid or brackish conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typical of the Amaranthaceae family. It thrives in coastal areas, marshes, and saline soils, often forming dense vegetation. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
