    "intro": "Atylus roseus, commonly known as the rose-like orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety purple flowers that resemble roses, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture. Atylus roseus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in greenhouses and gardens for its beauty."
