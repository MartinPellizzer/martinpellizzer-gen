    "intro": "Artemisia dracunculiformis, commonly known as the golden sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and aromatic, finely divided leaves that emit a strong, pungent odor. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used traditionally for its antiseptic and digestive benefits."
