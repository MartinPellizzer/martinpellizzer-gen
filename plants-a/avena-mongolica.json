    "intro": "Avena mongolica, commonly known as Mongolian oat, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in steppes and rocky soils. The plant has slender, tufted leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets. Its seeds are encased in a tough, fibrous hull, which aids in seed dispersal. Avena mongolica is valued for its hardiness and is used in ecological restoration projects."
