It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or calcareous soils, often found in alpine or woodland environments. Its leaves contain oxalic acid, which can be toxic if ingested in large quantities. Acetosella rupestris is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature and ornamental value.",
