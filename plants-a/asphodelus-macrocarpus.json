    "intro": "Asphodelus macrocarpus, commonly known as the large-fruited asphodel, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its strap-like, grass-like leaves. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing clusters of pale yellow to orange flowers. Its flowers are followed by large, fleshy, red or orange berries that contain the seeds. Asphodelus macrocarpus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
