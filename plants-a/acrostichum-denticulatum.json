    "intro": "Acrostichum denticulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a member of the Davalliaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically dark green and finely toothed. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas or near freshwater sources. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a common sight in wetlands and mangrove forests. The plant's botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically significant in its native habitats.",
