    "intro": "Acrostichum ruta-muraria, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a species of fern native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that resemble a holly leaf. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a key feature of fern reproduction.",
