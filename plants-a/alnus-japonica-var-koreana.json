    "intro": "Alnus japonica var. koreana, commonly known as Korean alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Korea and parts of Japan. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain several winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits, including nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with Frankia bacteria."
