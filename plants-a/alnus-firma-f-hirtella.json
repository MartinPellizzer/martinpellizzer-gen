    "intro": "Alnus firma f. hirtella, commonly known as the hairy alder, is a variant of the alder tree characterized by its dense, hairy foliage. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States, particularly in regions with moist, well-drained soils. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are catkin-like, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and it produces small, winged fruits that disperse via wind. The species is valued for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its role in nitrogen fixation through symbiotic relationships with Frankia bacteria."
