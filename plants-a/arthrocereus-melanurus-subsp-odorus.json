    "intro": "Arthrocereus melanurus subsp. odorus, commonly known as the sweet-scented night bloomer, is a cactus native to southern Brazil. It is characterized by its columnar stem and clusters of spines, which help it survive in arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, with a strong, sweet scent. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental beauty and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
