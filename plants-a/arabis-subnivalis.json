    "intro": "Arabis subnivalis, commonly known as the alpine rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and other mountainous areas. It is a low-growing perennial that typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help protect it from harsh weather conditions. Arabis subnivalis is an important component of alpine ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and soil stabilization in its environment."
