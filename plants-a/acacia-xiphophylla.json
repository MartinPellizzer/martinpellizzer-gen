    "intro": "Acacia xiphophylla, commonly known as the coastal wattle, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted stems and bipinnate leaves that are small and feathery. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. Acacia xiphophylla is also known for its ability to tolerate salt spray and coastal winds.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia xiphophylla is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the southern and central regions of the state. This species thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often seen in coastal and inland areas. It is a hardy shrub that contributes to the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for native wildlife. Its distribution is closely tied to the arid and semi-arid environments of Western Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia xiphophylla was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has been cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and drought tolerance. It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides, particularly in the western and southern regions of the country. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. However, it has also been reported to spread into natural habitats, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. Despite its aesthetic value, its introduction has led to ecological challenges in some areas."
