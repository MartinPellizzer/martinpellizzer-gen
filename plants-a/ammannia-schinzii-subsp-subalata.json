    "intro": "Ammannia schinzii subsp. subalata, commonly known as the subalpine ammannia, is a perennial herb native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish to reddish flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
