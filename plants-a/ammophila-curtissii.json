    "intro": "Ammophila curtissii, commonly known as the sand cordgrass, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of the United States. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found along shorelines and dunes, where it plays a crucial role in stabilizing sand dunes. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes help bind the sand, preventing erosion and supporting other coastal vegetation. Ammophila curtissii is an important component of coastal ecosystems, contributing to the resilience of dune habitats."
