    "intro": "Asplenium blotiae, commonly known as the Blotia spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, strap-like leaves that are often clustered at the base. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or forest floors. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the leaves, arranged in clusters called sori. Asplenium blotiae is a relatively rare species, often found in specific microhabitats across temperate regions."
