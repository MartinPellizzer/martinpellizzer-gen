    "intro": "Aeschynomene rivularis, commonly known as waterweed or rivergrass, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along water edges or moist soil. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or white in color. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Aeschynomene rivularis is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
