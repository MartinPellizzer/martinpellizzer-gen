    "intro": "Anacamptis longicornu subsp. linkiana, commonly known as the longhorn orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and a single, showy inflorescence composed of several elongated, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing fragrant flowers that attract pollinators like bees and moths. Due to habitat loss, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
