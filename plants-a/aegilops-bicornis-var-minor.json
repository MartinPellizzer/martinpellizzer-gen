    "intro": "Aegilops bicornis var. minor, commonly known as the two-lobed wild rye, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear two-lobed, awned glumes, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. This species is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for improving wheat breeding programs."
