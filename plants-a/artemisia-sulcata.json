    "intro": "Artemisia sulcata, commonly known as the desert sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry conditions. Its leaves contain volatile oils, which contribute to its strong, pungent scent. Artemisia sulcata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert organisms."
