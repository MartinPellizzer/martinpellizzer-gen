    "intro": "Aquilegia canadensis var. fendleri, commonly known as the Fendler's columbine, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features striking blue to purple flowers with five petals and numerous sepals, arranged in a spurred pattern typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has lance-shaped, doubly serrated leaves that are alternate along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in rocky or open woodland habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
