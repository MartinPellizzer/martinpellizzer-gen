    "intro": "Alsine graminifolia var. dalmatica, commonly known as the Dalmatian sandgrass, is a perennial flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Adriatic Sea. It thrives in sandy and calcareous soils, often found in dune environments and coastal grasslands. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by capsule fruits containing minute seeds. It is characterized by its low-growing, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. This variety is adapted to saline and wind-exposed conditions, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
