    "intro": "Aulomyrcia amethystina var. pulchra, commonly known as the purple-flowered aulomyrcia, is a striking plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, violet-pink bracts that resemble petals. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are leathery and have a glossy texture, contributing to its ornamental value. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation and display."
