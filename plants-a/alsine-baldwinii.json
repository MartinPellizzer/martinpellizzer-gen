    "intro": "Alsine baldwinii, commonly known as Baldwin's sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Alsine baldwinii is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun."
