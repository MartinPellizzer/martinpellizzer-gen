    "intro": "Arctostaphylos edmundsii var. parvifolia, commonly known as the coastal manzanita, is a shrub native to coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its fruit is a red, leathery berry that contains several seeds. This species is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and well-drained soils, and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats."
