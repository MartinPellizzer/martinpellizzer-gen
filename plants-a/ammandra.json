    "intro": "Ammandra, commonly known as the Indian bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Campanulaceae family. These plants are native to the Indian subcontinent and are characterized by their bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to blue. Ammandra species typically grow in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. The leaves are usually alternate, ovate, and have a rough texture, while the flowers are clustered in umbels. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their delicate appearance."
