    "intro": "Angelica sylvestris var. montana, commonly known as mountain angelica, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, often with a distinct purple or greenish hue. The plant produces large, umbrella-like compound leaves and yellow flowers arranged in a dense, branched inflorescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The roots and stems are used in traditional medicine and as a culinary spice, though the plant is toxic if ingested in large quantities."
