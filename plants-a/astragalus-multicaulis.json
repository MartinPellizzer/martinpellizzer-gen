    "intro": "Astragalus multicaulis, commonly known as the many-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Astragalus multicaulis is adapted to dry conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. It is often found in grasslands, shrublands, and along rocky slopes."
