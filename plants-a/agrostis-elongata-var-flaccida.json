It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and riverbanks. The plant has slender, upright stems that often bend or droop under the weight of its inflorescence. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture. The inflorescence is a panicle composed of spikelets, which are small, clustered flower clusters."
