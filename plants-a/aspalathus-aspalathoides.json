    "intro": "Aspalathus aspalathoides, commonly known as the small-leaved rooibos, is a shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and produces tiny yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is closely related to the more well-known rooibos (Aspalathus linearis) but differs in leaf structure and flowering habits. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a Mediterranean climate with mild, wet winters. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
