    "intro": "Arctostaphylos mewukka, commonly known as Mewukka manzanita, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California and northern Baja California. It is characterized by its reddish-brown bark and clusters of small, urn-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, leathery berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild, wet winters and dry summers. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
