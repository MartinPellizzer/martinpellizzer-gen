    "intro": "Arabis pendula var. hebecarpa, commonly known as the weeping rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features delicate, pendulous clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming habit with hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shady, well-drained areas."
