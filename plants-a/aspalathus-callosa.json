    "intro": "Aspalathus callosa, commonly known as the silver leaf bush, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves, which are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round, brown pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for coastal and sandy environments. Aspalathus callosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract beneficial insects."
