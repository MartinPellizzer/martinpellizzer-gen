    "intro": "Arachniodes lurida, commonly known as the spider fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble a spider's web, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are bi-lobed and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, with a distinctive, arching growth habit. Arachniodes lurida is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
