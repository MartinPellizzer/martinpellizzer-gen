It features striking, deeply lobed leaves that are often tinged with silver or gray, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tall spikes of violet-blue flowers in the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value and hardiness make it a favored plant in both garden and horticultural settings.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthus mollis var. viciosoi is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, particularly southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is found in countries such as Spain, Italy, France, and Morocco. This variety thrives in rocky coastal areas and limestone soils. It is commonly associated with coastal cliffs and maritime environments. Its native distribution is limited to these specific geographic regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus mollis var. viciosoi was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its striking, deeply lobed leaves and showy, spiky flowers. It is often used in garden settings to add visual interest and texture. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for Mediterranean and temperate climates. Its introduction has led to its cultivation in various regions beyond its native range. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts."
