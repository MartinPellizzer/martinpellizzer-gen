    "intro": "Anthyllis subsimplex, commonly known as the simple anthyllis, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, and is often found in disturbed or coastal areas. Anthyllis subsimplex is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a food source for certain pollinators."
