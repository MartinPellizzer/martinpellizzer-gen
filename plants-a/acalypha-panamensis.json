    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha panamensis is primarily native to Central America, specifically Panama and parts of Colombia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, lowland areas. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with forest understories or near water sources. Its distribution is limited to specific geographic regions within the Neotropical realm. It is not widely cultivated outside its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha panamensis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various climates. It is commonly found in landscapes and gardens in countries such as the United States, Australia, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for a wide range of environments. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction have contributed to its widespread distribution. However, in some areas, it has become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems."
