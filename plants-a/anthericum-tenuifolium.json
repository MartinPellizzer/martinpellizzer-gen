    "intro": "Anthericum tenuifolium, commonly known as slender-leaved ladies' tresses, is a perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 1 cm wide. The plant produces a tall, unbranched flowering stem topped with a dense spike of small, pale green to white flowers. It prefers moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
