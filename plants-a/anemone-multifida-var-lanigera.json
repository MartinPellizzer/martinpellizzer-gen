It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in a soft, fuzzy texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, white to pale pink flowers with five to seven petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its delicate appearance and easy care requirements make it a valuable addition to native plant collections."
