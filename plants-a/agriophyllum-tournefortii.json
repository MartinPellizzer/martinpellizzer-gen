    "intro": "Agriophyllum tournefortii, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing, shrub-like plant with grey-green, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with limited rainfall. Its fibrous stems have historically been used for textile production, reflecting its economic and ecological significance in its native habitats."
