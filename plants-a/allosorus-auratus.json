    "intro": "Allosorus auratus, commonly known as the golden star moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and bright yellow to gold-colored leaves that form a striking contrast with its dark green stems. Native to moist, shaded environments in temperate regions, this plant thrives in rocky or forested areas with high humidity. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a distinct midrib, with a waxy coating that aids in water retention. Allosorus auratus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
