    "intro": "Afrocanthium kilifiense, commonly known as the Kilifi thornveld grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its robust, tufted growth habit and narrow, erect leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and open grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and is sometimes used in traditional landscaping."
