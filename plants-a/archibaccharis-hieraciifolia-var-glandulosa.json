    "intro": "Archibaccharis hieraciifolia var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular false heather, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, needle-like leaves that are densely packed, giving it a compact, mat-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are often covered in glandular dots, which secrete oils and contribute to its aromatic properties. This species is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid environments."
