    "intro": "Andromeda speciosa, commonly known as the rosebay witch-hazel, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has opposite, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall, adding to its seasonal appeal. Its bark is typically reddish-brown and becomes fissured with age. Andromeda speciosa is adapted to moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland habitats."
