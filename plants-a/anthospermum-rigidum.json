    "intro": "Anthospermum rigidum, commonly known as the rigid anthospermum, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many species with showy flowers and often aromatic foliage. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, rigid leaves that give it its common name. Its small, clustered flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Anthospermum rigidum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks."
