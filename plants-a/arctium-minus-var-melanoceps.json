    "intro": "Arctium minus var. melanoceps, commonly known as the black burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces spiky, brownish-purple burrs that contain seeds with hooked bracts, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in meadows. Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and thistles."
