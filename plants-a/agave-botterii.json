    "intro": "Agave botterii, commonly known as the Blue Agave, is a succulent plant native to the Mexican state of Tamaulipas. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy, bluish-green leaves that form a rosette shape. The plant produces a tall flower stalk that can reach up to 10 feet in height, bearing clusters of white to pale blue flowers. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Agave botterii is also notable for its use in the production of tequila, though it is not the primary species used."
