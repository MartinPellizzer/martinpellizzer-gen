    "intro": "Andropogon thomasii, commonly known as Thomas's switchgrass, is a native grass species found primarily in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Thomas's switchgrass is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
