It typically grows in open grasslands and disturbed soils, displaying a tufted growth habit with fine, wiry leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often adorned with bristly hairs, aiding in wind dispersal of seeds. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy component of native vegetation. Its botanical features make it an important plant for ecological stability and soil conservation in arid regions."
