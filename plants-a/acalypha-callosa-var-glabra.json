    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha callosa var. glabra is primarily native to the southeastern United States, including states such as Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and Alabama. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks, swamps, and other wetland habitats. This variety is known for its smooth, hairless leaves and is often found in disturbed or riparian areas. It is commonly associated with the coastal plain regions of the southeastern U.S. and is part of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining wetland ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha callosa var. glabra was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in moist to wet habitats such as streambanks, swamps, and marshes. This plant is often associated with disturbed sites and can thrive in areas with high soil moisture. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and cultivated environments. However, it is considered a non-native species in many regions where it has been introduced."
