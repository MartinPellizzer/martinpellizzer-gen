    "intro": "Anisomeris tenuiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved anisomeris, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and typically wind-pollinated reproductive structures. The plant is distinguished by its slender, linear leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Anisomeris tenuiflora is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
