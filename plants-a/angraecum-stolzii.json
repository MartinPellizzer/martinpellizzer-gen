    "intro": "Angraecum stolzii, commonly known as the star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, white, star-shaped flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers open at night, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators like the hawkmoth. This unique adaptation makes it a fascinating subject in the study of plant-pollinator relationships."
