It features silver-gray foliage with finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rocky or arid landscapes. Its aromatic properties make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and traditional herbal uses."
