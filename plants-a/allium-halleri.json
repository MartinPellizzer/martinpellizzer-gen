    "intro": "Allium halleri, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Allium genus, which includes onions, garlic, and leeks, and is characterized by its bulbous stem and clustered leaves. The plant produces small, white or purple flowers in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are edible and have a pungent, garlic-like flavor, making it a culinary herb in some regions. However, it is also considered an invasive species in North America due to its rapid spread and competitive nature."
