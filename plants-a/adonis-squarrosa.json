    "intro": "Adonis squarrosa, commonly known as the squarrose adonis, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, woolly leaves and a tall flowering stem that produces clusters of yellow, cup-shaped flowers. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Adonis squarrosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun.",
