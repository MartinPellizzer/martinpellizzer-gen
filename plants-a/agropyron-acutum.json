    "intro": "Agropyron acutum, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or arid soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It is adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and resilience to grazing. Agropyron acutum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
