    "intro": "Anemone nemorosa var. metamorphosis-insignis, commonly known as the Transformed Wood Anemone, is a rare and striking variant of the common wood anemone. It is characterized by its unique, often deeply lobed, and sometimes almost fern-like leaves that differ significantly from the typical foliage of the species. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, with five to seven petals, and bloom in early spring. This variant is native to specific regions in Europe and is often found in shaded, moist woodlands. Due to its rarity and distinct appearance, it is of interest to botanists and plant enthusiasts alike."
