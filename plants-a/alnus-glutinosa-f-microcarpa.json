    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa f. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf alder, is a shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and small, spherical female flowers that develop into woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. This variety is noted for its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful for soil stabilization and ecological restoration."
