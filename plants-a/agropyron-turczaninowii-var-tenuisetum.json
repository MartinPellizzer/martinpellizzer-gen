It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous slender spikelets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. This variety is often used for erosion control and as a forage plant in semi-arid regions."
