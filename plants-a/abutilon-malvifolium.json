    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon malvifolium is primarily native to New South Wales, Northern Territory, Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia. This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions across these states. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. The species is well adapted to the climatic conditions of the Australian interior. Its distribution reflects its ability to survive in harsh, dry environments.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon malvifolium was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in full sun to partial shade. It is commonly found in coastal regions and disturbed soils, often spreading through seeds dispersed by wind or water. This plant is known for its ornamental value due to its hairy stems and showy flowers. It has been introduced to several parts of the world, including the Pacific Islands and parts of Southeast Asia. However, it is considered invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
