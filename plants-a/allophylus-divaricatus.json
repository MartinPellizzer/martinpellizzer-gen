    "intro": "Allophylus divaricatus, commonly known as the variable holly or African holly, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by small, red or orange berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Allophylus divaricatus is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine."
