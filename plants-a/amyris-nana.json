    "intro": "Amyris nana, commonly known as dwarf sandpaper tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It features narrow, leathery leaves that are covered in a fine, sandpapery texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
