    "intro": "Asperula cynanchica var. scabridula, commonly known as the scabrous asperula, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine, rough hairs, giving them a scabrous texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, wiry stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to botanical gardens and native plant collections."
