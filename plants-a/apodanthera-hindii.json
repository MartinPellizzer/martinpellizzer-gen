    "intro": "Apodanthera hindii, commonly known as the Indian sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of India and Pakistan. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters during the cooler months. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in xeriscapes."
