    "intro": "Alchemilla schizophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Alchemilla schizophylla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
