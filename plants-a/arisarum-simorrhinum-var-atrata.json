    "intro": "Arisarum simorrhinum var. atrata, commonly known as the black-flowered arum, is a striking member of the Araceae family. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, spathaceous bracts that contrast sharply with its bright yellow spadix. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its unique floral structure consists of a single, elongated spadix surrounded by a leaf-like spathe. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and tropical landscapes."
