    "intro": "Angelica cartilaginomarginata var. makinoi, commonly known as Makino's angelica, is a rare and distinctive member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, compound leaves with a unique margin that resembles cartilage. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. It is native to Japan and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
