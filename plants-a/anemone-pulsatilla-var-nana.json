    "intro": "Anemone pulsatilla var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf pasqueflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features a short, upright stem with a single, showy, cup-shaped flower that is typically pale yellow to pink in color. The plant has basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a fine, white down. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. The flower blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully develop, making it a striking early-season wildflower."
