    "intro": "Aconitum nasutum var. pubiceps, commonly known as the pubicapped monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple, helmet-shaped flowers that are surrounded by two rows of spiny, leaf-like bracts. The plant has palmately compound leaves with lobes that are often hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, often growing in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care and avoid ingestion.",
