    "intro": "Avena sesquiflora, commonly known as slender oat, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces achenes as its fruit. Avena sesquiflora is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and its drought tolerance."
