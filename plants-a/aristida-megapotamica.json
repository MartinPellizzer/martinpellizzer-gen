    "intro": "Aristida megapotamica, commonly known as the Andean hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Aristida megapotamica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wet environments."
