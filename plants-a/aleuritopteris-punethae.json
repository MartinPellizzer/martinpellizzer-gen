    "intro": "Aleuritopteris punethae, commonly known as the Himalayan water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the mountainous regions of South Asia. It is characterized by its floating fronds that are often covered in a layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically found on the underside of the fronds. Aleuritopteris punethae plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
