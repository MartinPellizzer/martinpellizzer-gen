It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, onion-like flavor, making it a valuable addition to local cuisines.
