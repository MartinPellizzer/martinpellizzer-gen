The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to low moisture conditions. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets. This species is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
