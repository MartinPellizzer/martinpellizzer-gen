    "intro": "Asclepias sullivantii, commonly known as the Sullivant's milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and prairies. The plant features opposite, oval-shaped leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. Its milkweed species are known for their role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and host plants for their larvae. The plant's latex contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
