It produces small, yellow flowers and has trifoliate leaves, typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and clusters of edible seeds, which are similar to those of the common peanut. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and is often found in disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological and agricultural studies."
