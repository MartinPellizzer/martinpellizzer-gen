    "intro": "Apostasia brunonis, commonly known as the black orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae. Native to the rainforests of eastern Australia, it is characterized by its dark purple to black floral bracts, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spike, and it is typically found growing in shaded, moist environments. Apostasia brunonis is a terrestrial herb with a short rhizome and is often found in association with other epiphytic orchids. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
