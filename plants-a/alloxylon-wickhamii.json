    "intro": "Alloxylon wickhamii, commonly known as the Wicking Island acacia, is a small shrub native to the Australian island of Wicking Island. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in winter, which are arranged in dense, globular clusters. It is adapted to the arid and saline conditions of its coastal habitat. Alloxylon wickhamii is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution."
