    "intro": "Alyssum montanum f. preissmannii, commonly known as the Alpine Alyssum, is a compact, low-growing plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage with hairy leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid, high-altitude habitat. It is often cultivated as a decorative plant in rock gardens and alpine displays due to its ornamental value and hardiness. This variety is a natural hybrid, showcasing unique characteristics that distinguish it from the typical species."
