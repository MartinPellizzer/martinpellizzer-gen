    "intro": "Armeniaca vulgaris var. scaberrima, commonly known as the wild peach or bitter almond tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in spring, followed by fruits that are typically small, round, and have a bitter flavor. Its fruit contains a single hard pit and is often used in traditional medicine. The species is notable for its toxic properties, particularly due to the presence of cyanogenic glycosides in its seeds and leaves."
