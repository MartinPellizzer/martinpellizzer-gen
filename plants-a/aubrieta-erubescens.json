    "intro": "Aubrieta erubescens, commonly known as the rock cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountains of southern Europe. It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with silver-gray foliage that is covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Aubrieta erubescens is valued for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
