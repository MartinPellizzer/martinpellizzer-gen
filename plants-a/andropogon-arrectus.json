    "intro": "Andropogon arrectus, commonly known as tall bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring narrow, blue-green leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces dense, cylindrical flower spikes that bloom in late summer, releasing light blue to purple florets. It is well adapted to prairie and dry woodland environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils. Its extensive root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
