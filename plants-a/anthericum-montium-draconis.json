    "intro": "Anthericum montium-draconis, commonly known as Dragon's Beard, is a rare and elusive plant species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
