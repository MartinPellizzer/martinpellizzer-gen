    "intro": "Achillea millefolium var. puberula, commonly known as the downy yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, silvery-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, flat-topped flowers in shades of white, pink, or pale yellow, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and borders. This variety is closely related to common yarrow and shares similar medicinal uses, including anti-inflammatory and astringent properties.",
