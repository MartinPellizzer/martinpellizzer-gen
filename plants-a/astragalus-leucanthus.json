    "intro": "Astragalus leucanthus, commonly known as white-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Astragalus leucanthus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
