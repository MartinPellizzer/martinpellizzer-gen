    "intro": "Agropyron barbatulum, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including sandy and loamy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Agropyron barbatulum is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ecological benefits."
