    "intro": "Asclepias erosa, commonly known as the slender milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with distinctive horn-shaped buds and bright orange to yellow petals. It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is known for its latex sap, which is milky and toxic. Asclepias erosa serves as a host plant for the monarch butterfly and other pollinators, making it ecologically significant."
