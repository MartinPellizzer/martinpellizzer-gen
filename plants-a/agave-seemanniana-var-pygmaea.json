    "intro": "Agave seemanniana var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf blue agave, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to Mexico. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, greenish-white flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with full sun exposure. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in rock gardens or as a container plant."
