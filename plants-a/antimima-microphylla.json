    "intro": "Antimima microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved antimima, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its fibrous roots allow it to survive in poor, sandy soils and withstand periods of drought. Antimima microphylla is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
