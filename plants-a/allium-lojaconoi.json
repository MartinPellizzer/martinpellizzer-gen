    "intro": "Allium lojaconoi, commonly known as the Lojaconoi onion, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Sardinia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single, tall flowering stem topped with a dense cluster of white to pale pink flowers. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
