    "intro": "Amygdalus warleyensis, commonly known as the Warley almond, is a rare species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, ornamental flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, edible nuts similar to those of the common almond, though it is less widely cultivated. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a serrated margin, and the bark is smooth and grayish in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in botanical studies."
