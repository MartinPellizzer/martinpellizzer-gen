    "intro": "Agropyron pinifolium, commonly known as needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, needle-like leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Agropyron pinifolium is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
