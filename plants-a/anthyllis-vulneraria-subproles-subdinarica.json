    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria subproles subdinarica, commonly known as the Balkan broomrape, is a hemiparasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its yellowish or reddish flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, pod-like fruits containing seeds. Due to its parasitic nature, it is often found in association with grasses and other herbaceous plants."
