It is characterized by its opposite, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces samaras, which are winged seeds dispersed by wind. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming furrowed with age. The sugar maple is valued for its ornamental beauty and its role in producing maple syrup.",
