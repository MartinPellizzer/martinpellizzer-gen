    "intro": "Astragalus nuttallianus var. acutirostris, commonly known as the sharp-beaked milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, compound leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are usually pink to purple, arranged in clusters, and are pollinated by insects. The seeds are enclosed in hairy pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind."
