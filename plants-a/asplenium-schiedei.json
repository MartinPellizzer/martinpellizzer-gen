    "intro": "Asplenium schiedei, commonly known as the Schied's spleenwort, is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae). It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic fern that typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has thin, delicate fronds that are usually divided into lance-shaped segments, with a distinctive, narrow, and often curled appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typically in clusters. Asplenium schiedei is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and is often found in montane forests."
