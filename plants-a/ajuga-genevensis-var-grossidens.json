    "intro": "Ajuga genevensis var. grossidens, commonly known as the broad-leaf bugleweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branched stems that bear opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in early summer, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical seed capsules. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its dense growth habit makes it a useful ground cover in gardens and restoration projects."
