    "intro": "Arctostaphylos nevadensis subsp. knightii, commonly known as the Sierra foothill manzanita, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically oval and leathery, and its clusters of white to pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for some wildlife but not for humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, rocky habitats. This subspecies is often found in chaparral and woodland areas, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native range."
