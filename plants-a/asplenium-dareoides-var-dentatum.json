    "intro": "Asplenium dareoides var. dentatum, commonly known as the toothed spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its small, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into toothed segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or tree trunks. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread gradually over time. This variety is notable for its distinctive leaf morphology, which aids in its identification within the genus Asplenium."
