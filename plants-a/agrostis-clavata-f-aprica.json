    "intro": "Agrostis clavata f. aprica, commonly known as the spring bentgrass, is a variant of the bentgrass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing, perennial grass characterized by its fine, dark green leaves and dense, mat-like growth habit. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis clavata f. aprica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in maintaining ecological balance in grassland ecosystems."
