It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with forest edges or riverine habitats. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is known for its ornamental leaves and spikes of small flowers. Its native distribution spans across much of eastern and central Africa.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus polystachyus was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit. However, it has since become naturalized and is now considered a potential weed in certain regions. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction. Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems."
