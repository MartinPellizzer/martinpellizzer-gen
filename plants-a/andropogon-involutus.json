    "intro": "Andropogon involutus, commonly known as the curled bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland areas and is characterized by its compact, clumping growth habit. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often folded or rolled when young, giving it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle, which produces small, spikelet-like flowers. Andropogon involutus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
