    "intro": "Atriplex salaris, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent leaves, which are adapted to store water and reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant thrives in saline soils and is often found in coastal areas, salt deserts, and inland saline habitats. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits containing seeds. Atriplex salaris plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
