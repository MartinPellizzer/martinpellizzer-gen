    "intro": "Allocarya sessiliflora var. nubigena, commonly known as the cloud-dwelling rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves adapted to arid conditions. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its varietal name, *nubigena*, refers to its association with cloud forests, where it thrives in misty, humid environments. The species is valued for its resilience and unique ecological role in mountain ecosystems."
