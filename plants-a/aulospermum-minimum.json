    "intro": "Aulospermum minimum, commonly known as the small aulospermum, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Aulospermum minimum is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
