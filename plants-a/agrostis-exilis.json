    "intro": "Agrostis exilis, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and forms dense sods, making it a common species in lawns and turfgrass mixes. Its rhizomes and stolons allow it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its persistence in various habitats. Agrostis exilis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its use in erosion control."
