    "intro": "Anagallis arvensis var. parviflora, commonly known as the lesser mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing annual or biennial herb with small, pink or white flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. The plant typically has hairy stems and leaves that are opposite and oval in shape. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its scientific name reflects its close relation to the common mouse-ear (Anagallis arvensis), but it is distinguished by its smaller flowers and shorter stature."
