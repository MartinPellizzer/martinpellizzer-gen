    "intro": "Adicea mexicana, commonly known as Mexican milkweed, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which can be harmful if ingested. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. Adicea mexicana plays an important role in supporting local pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees.",
