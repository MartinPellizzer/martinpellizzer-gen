    "intro": "Anthyllis genistae, commonly known as the creeping yellow sweetclover, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are narrow and slightly hairy. Anthyllis genistae is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it valuable in ecological restoration projects."
