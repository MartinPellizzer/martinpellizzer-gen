    "intro": "Astragalus cerasinus, commonly known as red milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Astragalus cerasinus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
