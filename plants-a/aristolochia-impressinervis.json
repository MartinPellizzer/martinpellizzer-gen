    "intro": "Aristolochia impressinervis, commonly known as the narrow-veined Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves with prominent, parallel veins. The plant produces showy, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish or brownish with a strong, often unpleasant odor. Its fruit is a smooth, elongated capsule that splits open to release small, shiny seeds. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
