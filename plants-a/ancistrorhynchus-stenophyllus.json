    "intro": "Ancistrorhynchus stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ancistrus, is a species of freshwater fish native to South America. It belongs to the family Loricariidae, commonly referred to as armored catfish, and is characterized by its distinctive, overlapping bony plates covering its body. The plant-like appearance of its body and the way it often clings to aquatic vegetation give it a botanical resemblance to certain aquatic plants. While not a plant, its habitat and appearance are closely tied to the botanical environment of its native waters. This species is often found in slow-moving streams and rivers with dense vegetation, where it feeds on algae and detritus."
