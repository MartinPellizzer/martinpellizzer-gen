    "intro": "Anthyllis tournefortii, commonly known as the Turk's Cap or Red Broom, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or dry soils, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and the plant has a woody stem with thorny branches. Anthyllis tournefortii is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
