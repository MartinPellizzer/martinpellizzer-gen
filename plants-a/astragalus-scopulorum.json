    "intro": "Astragalus scopulorum, commonly known as the rock milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
