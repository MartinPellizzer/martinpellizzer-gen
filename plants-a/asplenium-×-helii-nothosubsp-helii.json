    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 helii nothosubsp. helii, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between *Asplenium trichomanes* and *Asplenium scolopendrium*. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies. While it does not produce viable spores, it is valued for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
