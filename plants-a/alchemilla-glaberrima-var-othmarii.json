    "intro": "Alchemilla glaberrima var. othmarii, commonly known as the Othmar\u2019s lady\u2019s mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Alpine regions of Europe. It features a dense rosette of silver-white, hairy leaves that are slightly wavy in texture. The plant produces upright, branched inflorescences of small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in alpine settings."
