    "intro": "Astragalus sulcatus, commonly known as the grooved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus sulcatus is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils with low moisture availability. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat."
