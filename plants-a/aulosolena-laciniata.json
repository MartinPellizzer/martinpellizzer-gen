    "intro": "Aulosolena laciniata, commonly known as the laceleaf cycad, is a unique cycad species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided, feather-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant has a stout, unbranched stem that remains underground, supporting the foliage above. Its reproductive structures include a large, cone-like male inflorescence and a smaller, female cone. Aulosolena laciniata is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is considered a rare and endangered species."
