    "intro": "Avena macra, commonly known as the giant oat, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, white to pale blue flowers, which are typically borne on long, drooping branches. Avena macra thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important plant for ecological studies and potential agricultural applications."
