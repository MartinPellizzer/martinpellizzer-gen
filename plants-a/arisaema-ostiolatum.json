    "intro": "Arisaema ostiolatum, commonly known as the Chinese arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern Asia. It features a distinctive leaf structure with a broad, arrow-shaped leaf blade and a short petiole. The plant produces an underground tuber that serves as a storage organ and is often used in traditional medicine. Its flowering stem bears a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe, which is characteristic of the Araceae family. Arisaema ostiolatum thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories."
