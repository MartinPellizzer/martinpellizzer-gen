    "intro": "Anthericum subulatum var. longibracteatum, commonly known as the long-bract lily, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and striking, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces long, lance-shaped bracts that enclose the flower buds, giving it its distinctive appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
