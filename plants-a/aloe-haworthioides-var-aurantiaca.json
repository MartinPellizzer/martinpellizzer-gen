    "intro": "Aloe haworthioides var. aurantiaca, commonly known as the Orange Aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically a pale green with a reddish or orange tinge, especially under sunlight. The leaves are covered in a thin, waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss, a characteristic adaptation to its arid native environment. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers on tall, leafless stems during the summer months. This variety is prized for its unique coloration and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
