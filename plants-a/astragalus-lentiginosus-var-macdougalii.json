    "intro": "Astragalus lentiginosus var. macdougalii, commonly known as the MacDougal's milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, stipitate leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and gravelly soils. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
