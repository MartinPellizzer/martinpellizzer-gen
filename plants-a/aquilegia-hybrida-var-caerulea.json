    "intro": "Aquilegia hybrida var. caerulea, commonly known as the blue poppy, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant blue to purple flowers, which are spurred at the base and bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound, trifoliate leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a fine downy texture. It thrives in well-drained, fertile soil and prefers partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its long blooming period and attractive foliage."
