    "intro": "Adenostyles polyantha, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and prolonged flowering period.",
