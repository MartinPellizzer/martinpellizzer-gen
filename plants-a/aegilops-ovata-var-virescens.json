    "intro": "Aegilops ovata var. virescens, commonly known as the green spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, greenish stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
