    "intro": "Alloteropsis latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf alloteropsis, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it useful in ecological restoration projects. Alloteropsis latifolia is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in full sun conditions."
