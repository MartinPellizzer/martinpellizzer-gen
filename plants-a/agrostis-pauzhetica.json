    "intro": "Agrostis pauzhetica, commonly known as the narrowleaf bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 2 mm wide. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis pauzhetica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its fine texture and ability to form dense turf."
