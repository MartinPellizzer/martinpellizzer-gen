    "intro": "Alyssum montanum var. thiebautii, commonly known as the Thiebaut's alpine alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage with soft, fuzzy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
