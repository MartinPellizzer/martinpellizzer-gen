    "intro": "Angiopteris brongniartiana, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its massive, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to three meters. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and swamps. Its rhizomes grow beneath the water's surface, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients. The fronds are divided into numerous pinnae, which are arranged in a distinctive, feather-like pattern."
