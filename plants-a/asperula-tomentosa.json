    "intro": "Asperula tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly woodbine, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Asperula tomentosa thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a versatile choice for woodland gardens. It is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
