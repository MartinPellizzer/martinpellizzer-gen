    "intro": "Artemisia ursorum, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, which bloom in late summer. Artemisia ursorum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported antiparasitic and digestive properties. Its essential oils contain compounds like thujone, which contribute to its distinctive aroma and medicinal uses."
