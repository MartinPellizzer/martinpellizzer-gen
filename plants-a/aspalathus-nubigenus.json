    "intro": "Aspalathus nubigenus, commonly known as the cloudless bushveld clover, is a small, evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pale yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils. It is often found in rocky areas and along coastal regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated as a ornamental plant."
