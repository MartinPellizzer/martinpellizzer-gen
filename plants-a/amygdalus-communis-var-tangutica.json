    "intro": "Amygdalus communis var. tangutica, commonly known as the Tangut peach, is a rare and ancient variety of peach native to the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, fuzzy fruits with a distinctive fragrance. The plant produces white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits that are highly valued in traditional Chinese medicine. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, while the bark is smooth and grayish-brown. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native habitat."
