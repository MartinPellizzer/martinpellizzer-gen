    "intro": "Alnus viridis f. laciniata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to North America. It is characterized by its finely serrated, lance-shaped leaves that give it a distinct appearance. The plant is typically found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in forested areas. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. This species is valued for its ability to thrive in disturbed sites and its role in soil stabilization."
