It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy flowers. The plant produces violet-blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed segments that are covered in a dense layer of hairs. Aconitum luanchuanense contains potent alkaloids, making it toxic and requiring careful handling.",
