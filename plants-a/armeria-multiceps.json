    "intro": "Armeria multiceps, commonly known as sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing perennial that produces dense clusters of white or pinkish flowers in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes, cliffs, and coastal grasslands. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscaping."
