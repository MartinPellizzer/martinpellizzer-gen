    "intro": "Acer hyrcanum, commonly known as the Hyrcanian maple, is a deciduous tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves, which are typically five-lobed and have a bright green upper surface. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions. The bark of Acer hyrcanum is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming more rugged with age.",
