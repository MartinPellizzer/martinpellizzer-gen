    "intro": "Alcea remotiflora, commonly known as the common hollyhock, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, rose-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, with large, palmately lobed leaves. Its flowers come in a range of colors, including pink, red, and white, and are arranged in spikes at the top of the stem. Alcea remotiflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
