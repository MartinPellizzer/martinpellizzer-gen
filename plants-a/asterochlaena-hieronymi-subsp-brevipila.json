    "intro": "Asterochlaena hieronymi subsp. brevipila, commonly known as the short-stemmed asterochlaena, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and typically herbaceous growth habit. The plant features narrow, lanceolate leaves arranged alternately along its stem, and it produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers in clusters. It is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
