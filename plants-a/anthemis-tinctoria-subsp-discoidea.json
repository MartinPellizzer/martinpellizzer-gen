    "intro": "Anthemis tinctoria subsp. discoidea, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers, which consist of ray florets and disk florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are upright and often branched. This species is known for its historical use in dyeing fabrics due to the presence of flavonoids in its flowers."
