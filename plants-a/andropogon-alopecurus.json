    "intro": "Andropogon alopecurus, commonly known as silky grass or silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in moist or wetland habitats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and establish in a variety of soil types. Andropogon alopecurus is often found in prairies, meadows, and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
