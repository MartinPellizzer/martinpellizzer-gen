    "intro": "Acanthophyllum, commonly known as the spiny gram or desert holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Amaranthaceae family. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their dense, spiny foliage and adaptations to arid environments. They are native to regions such as the Mediterranean, Central Asia, and parts of North Africa. Acanthophyllum species often have small, fleshy leaves and produce clusters of tiny, red or yellow flowers. Their botanical features make them well-suited for survival in harsh, dry climates with limited water availability."
