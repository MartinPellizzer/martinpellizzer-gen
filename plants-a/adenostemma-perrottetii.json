    "intro": "Adenostemma perrottetii, commonly known as the coastal bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in the arid coastal environment. Adenostemma perrottetii is an important species for stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along the coast.",
