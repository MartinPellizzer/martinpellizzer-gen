It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence known as a spadix, enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant features elongated, narrow leaves that are often arranged in a helical pattern along its stem. Its rhizomatous root system is used in traditional medicine and as a starch source. Arisaema angustatum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
