    "intro": "Armeria canescens f. pantoscekii, commonly known as the pale sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
