    "intro": "Aglaonema simplex f. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Chinese evergreen, is a varietal form of the Aglaonema species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, dark green, narrow leaves with prominent silver or white veins, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant is evergreen, meaning it retains its foliage year-round, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. It thrives in low to moderate light conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a favored ornamental plant in both residential and commercial settings."
