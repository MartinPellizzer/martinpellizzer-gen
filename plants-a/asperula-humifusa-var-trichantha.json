    "intro": "Asperula humifusa var. trichantha, commonly known as the hairy woodrose, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name and help it retain moisture in its native habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate foliage and long-lasting blooms."
