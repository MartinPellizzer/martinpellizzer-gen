    "intro": "Armeria microcephala, commonly known as sea thrift, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It features dense clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in saline and sandy soils. It thrives in full sun and is often found in dunes, cliffs, and coastal grasslands. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for coastal gardens and erosion control."
