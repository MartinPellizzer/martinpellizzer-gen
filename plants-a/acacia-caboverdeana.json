This species thrives in coastal areas and sandy soils. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is often used for its hardy characteristics. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climate of Cape Verde.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia caboverdeana was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly found in areas with low rainfall and poor soil quality. This plant is valued for its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions. It has been used in reforestation projects and as a source of timber and fuelwood. Its introduction has helped in restoring degraded lands in several parts of Africa."
