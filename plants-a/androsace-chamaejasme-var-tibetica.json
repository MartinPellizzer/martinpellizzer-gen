    "intro": "Androsace chamaejasme var. tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the Primulaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to its alpine habitat. Its leaves are typically succulent, adapted to retain moisture in the arid, cold environments it inhabits. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous regions."
