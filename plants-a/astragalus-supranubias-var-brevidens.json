    "intro": "Astragalus supranubias var. brevidens, commonly known as the short-stemmed cloud alpine. It is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, pea-like flowers. Native to the alpine regions of South America, it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils at high elevations. The plant produces clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with small, hairy leaflets that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment."
