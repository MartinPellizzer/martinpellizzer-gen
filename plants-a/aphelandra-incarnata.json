    "intro": "Aphelandra incarnata, commonly known as the flame belled plant, is a tropical perennial shrub native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that resemble flames, with bright orange or red bracts surrounding small, white flowers. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its leaves are typically glossy and dark green, with a slightly waxy texture. Aphelandra incarnata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant floral display and air-purifying qualities."
