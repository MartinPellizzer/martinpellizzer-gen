    "intro": "Allium lacerum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces small, white, bulbous flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has long, slender leaves that are often mistaken for grasses, and its bulbs are edible, though they have a mild garlic flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Allium lacerum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and culinary uses."
