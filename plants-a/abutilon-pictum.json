    "intro": "Abutilon pictum, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Indian mallow, is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its velvety, hairy leaves that give it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy, lantern-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the growing season. Its fibrous roots and robust stems make it adaptable to various soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions. Abutilon pictum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon pictum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded areas within forests. This plant is commonly associated with riverbanks and coastal areas where the climate is warm and humid. It is also found in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. Abutilon pictum is known for its ornamental value, with its hairy leaves and showy flowers making it a popular choice for horticultural use.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon pictum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, streambanks, and forest edges. This plant is considered an invasive species in some parts of its range due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can tolerate a range of light conditions. Its presence has raised concerns among land managers due to its potential to alter local ecosystems."
