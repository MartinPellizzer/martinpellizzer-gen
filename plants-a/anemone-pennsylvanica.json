    "intro": "Anemone pennsylvanica, commonly known as the Pennsylvania anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features showy, white to pale pink flowers with a distinctive yellow center, blooming in early spring. The plant has palmately divided, lobed leaves that are hairy and often covered in fine, silvery hairs. Its root system consists of a short, thick rhizome that stores nutrients and helps the plant survive winter. The species is well adapted to moist, shaded woodland environments and is often found in rich, loamy soils."
