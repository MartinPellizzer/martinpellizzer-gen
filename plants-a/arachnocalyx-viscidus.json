    "intro": "Arachnocalyx viscidus, commonly known as the sticky bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, bell-shaped flowers that are often covered in a sticky substance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and swampy areas. Its leaves are opposite and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The sticky resin produced by the plant is a notable botanical feature, contributing to its unique ecological interactions."
