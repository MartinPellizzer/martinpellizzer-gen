    "intro": "Aphanes australis, commonly known as the southern sandbur, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features small, spiny seed pods that mature into burrs, which are adapted for seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in open areas such as fields and roadsides. Aphanes australis is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers."
