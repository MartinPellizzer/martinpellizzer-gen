    "intro": "Astragalus macrolobus var. incanus, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. It has a deep taproot system, which allows it to survive in arid conditions. The species is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations."
