    "intro": "Asclepias matelea, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It features showy, orange-red flowers with a distinctive horn-shaped structure at the center, typical of the milkweed genus. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Asclepias matelea is an important host plant for monarch butterflies, providing nectar for adult butterflies and a site for egg-laying."
