    "intro": "Ampelocissus schimperiana, commonly known as the climbing fig or Schimper's fig, is a woody vine native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing habit and heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often dark green in color. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are typically yellow when ripe. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage. Ampelocissus schimperiana is also valued for its ability to climb and cover structures, making it a popular choice for living walls and trellises."
