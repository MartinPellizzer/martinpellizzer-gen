    "intro": "Adenanthos glabrescens subsp. glabrescens, commonly known as the woolly adenanthos, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a small shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as heathlands and woodlands. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil.",
