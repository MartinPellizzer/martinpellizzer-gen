    "intro": "Asplenium willdenovii, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or on rocky surfaces. Asplenium willdenovii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate a range of growing conditions."
