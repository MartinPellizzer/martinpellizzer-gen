    "intro": "Aristida tenella, commonly known as purple threeawn, is a flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets that are often tinged with purple, giving it its common name. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are typically blue-green in color and can grow up to 30 inches tall. Aristida tenella is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
