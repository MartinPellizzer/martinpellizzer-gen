    "intro": "Amphiasma micranthum, commonly known as the small-flowered amphiasma, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy or open habitats, often in disturbed soils. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are surrounded by bracts, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
