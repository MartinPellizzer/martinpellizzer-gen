    "intro": "Adenochloa ecklonii, commonly known as the coastal grass or Ecklon's grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in coastal dunes and sandy soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Adenochloa ecklonii is adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds.",
