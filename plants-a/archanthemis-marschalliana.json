    "intro": "Archanthemis marschalliana, commonly known as the marsh marigold, is a flowering plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are usually submerged or floating on the water's surface. It is part of the Pontederiaceae family and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. The plant is also a food source for various aquatic insects and birds."
