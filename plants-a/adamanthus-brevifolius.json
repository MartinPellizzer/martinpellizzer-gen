    "intro": "Adamanthus brevifolius, commonly known as the Brazilian palm, is a flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a small, evergreen tree with a slender trunk and a crown of pinnate leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes.",
