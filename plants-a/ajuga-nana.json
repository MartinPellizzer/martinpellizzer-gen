    "intro": "Ajuga nana, commonly known as carpet bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in early to mid-summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in certain habitats."
