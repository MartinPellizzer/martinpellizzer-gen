    "intro": "Acacia hamiltoniana, commonly known as the Hamilton's wattle, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its golden-yellow floral spikes. The plant features compound leaves with multiple small leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates. Acacia hamiltoniana is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils.",

This plant typically grows in sandy soils and can be found in open woodlands and heathlands. It is well adapted to the local climate and plays an important role in the ecosystem. Its distribution is largely restricted to the eastern parts of New South Wales.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia hamiltoniana was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in the Western Cape and parts of the Eastern Cape. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen in coastal and semi-arid areas. It is used for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and yellow flowers. However, it can sometimes become invasive in local ecosystems if not managed properly."
