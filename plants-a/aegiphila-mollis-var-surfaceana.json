    "intro": "Aegiphila mollis var. surfaceana, commonly known as the Surfacean ironwood, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the cooler months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its deep root system allows it to thrive in poor soils and withstand prolonged drought. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
