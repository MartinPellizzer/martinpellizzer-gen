    "intro": "Aristolochia esoterica, commonly known as the sacred or mysterious Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are often maroon or purple in color. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and emits a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor. It is part of the Aristolochiaceae family and is known for its complex floral structure that attracts specific pollinators. However, it contains toxic compounds and is not recommended for cultivation due to its potential hazards."
