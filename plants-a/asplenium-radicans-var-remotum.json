    "intro": "Asplenium radicans var. remotum, commonly known as the wandering spleen fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features slender, creeping rhizomes that produce small, lance-shaped leaves with a pale green to silver-white underside. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with finely divided pinnae that give the plant a feathery appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
