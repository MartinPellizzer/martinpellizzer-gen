    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha simplicistyla is primarily native to Peru. This plant is found in the Andean regions of the country, particularly in the highlands. It thrives in humid, temperate climates and is often seen growing in rocky or forested areas. The species is well adapted to the diverse ecosystems of Peru's mountainous terrain. It plays an important role in local biodiversity and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha simplicistyla was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of cultivation. It has since become naturalized in several regions, including Hawaii and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing along stream banks and in disturbed soils. Its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation. Despite its aesthetic appeal, efforts are being made to monitor and manage its distribution to prevent ecological harm."
