    "intro": "Argentacer, commonly known as silverleaf tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to parts of Africa and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in inflorescences, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
