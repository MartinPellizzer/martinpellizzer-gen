    "intro": "Aristida lemmonii, commonly known as Lemmon's threeawn, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that are composed of small, bristly spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture. This species is adapted to arid environments and is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil."
