    "intro": "Alysicarpus bupleurifolius, commonly known as the creeping cowpea, is a tropical legume native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which resemble those of the genus Vicia, and its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, oval pods containing several seeds, which are often used as a food source in some regions. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found growing in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it a valuable plant for soil enrichment in agricultural settings."
