    "intro": "Agrostis palustris var. aristata, commonly known as the meadow oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wet or moist habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshes, along stream banks, and in other damp environments where it can thrive in poorly drained soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
