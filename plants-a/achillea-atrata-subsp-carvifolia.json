It features basal leaves that are gray-green and woolly, with finely divided, fern-like upper leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow to white flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant once established.
