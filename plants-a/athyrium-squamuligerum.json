    "intro": "Athyrium squamuligerum, commonly known as the scaly wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are often covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium squamuligerum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with the right conditions."
