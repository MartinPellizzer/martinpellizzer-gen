    "intro": "Arum odoratum, commonly known as the sweet-scented arum, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves and a distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a showy spathe. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered around the spadix, which is often covered in a fragrant, waxy coating. The spathe is typically a deep purple or red, contrasting vividly with the pale flowers. Arum odoratum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
