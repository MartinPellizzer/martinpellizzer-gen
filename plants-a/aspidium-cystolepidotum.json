    "intro": "Aspidium cystolepidotum, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often divided into numerous pinnae, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Aspidium cystolepidotum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
