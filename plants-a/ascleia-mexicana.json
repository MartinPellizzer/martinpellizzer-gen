    "intro": "Ascleia mexicana, commonly known as Mexican whorled milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas. Ascleia mexicana is also a host plant for the monarch butterfly, making it ecologically significant."
