    "intro": "Alternanthera microphylla subsp. maior, commonly known as red flame plant or Brazilian fire plant, is a strikingly ornamental species native to South America. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically bright red or crimson in color, though they may vary in hue depending on light conditions. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous white flowers that are not particularly showy but are often followed by small, round berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for water gardens and containers. Its rapid growth and vibrant foliage make it a favorite among aquatic and terrestrial gardeners alike."
