It is characterized by its distinctive ascus structure, which is a sac-like organ that contains spores. The ascus of Ascium anomalum is notable for its unusual morphology, often exhibiting irregular shapes and sizes. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, where it thrives on decaying organic matter. Its botanical significance lies in its role in fungal reproduction and its potential ecological contributions to nutrient cycling."
