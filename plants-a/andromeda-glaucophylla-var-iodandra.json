    "intro": "Andromeda glaucophylla var. iodandra, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red, blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in coastal ecosystems."
