It features rosettes of fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland plantings."
