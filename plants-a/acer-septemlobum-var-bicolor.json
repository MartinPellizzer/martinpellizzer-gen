    "intro": "Acer septemlobum var. bicolor, commonly known as the twinleaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that split into seven lobes, with a striking bicolor pattern of green and red on the upper surface. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in woodland habitats.",
