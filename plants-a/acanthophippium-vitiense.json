    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthophippium vitiense is primarily native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Tonga and Fiji. It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This plant is often associated with humid tropical climates and is typically found in shaded undergrowth. Its distribution is limited to specific regions within the South Pacific, where it plays a role in local ecosystems. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthophippium vitiense was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and land clearing. It has been found growing in disturbed areas, including roadsides and abandoned fields. The plant's ability to thrive in poor soil conditions has contributed to its spread in non-native regions. It is often considered an invasive species in areas where it has become established. Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on local ecosystems and native plant species."
