    "intro": "Acer saccharinum subsp. floridanum, commonly known as the Florida maple, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed form and distinctive palmate leaves that turn bright yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland habitats. Its botanical features make it a unique and ecologically important species in its native range.",
