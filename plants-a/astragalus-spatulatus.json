    "intro": "Astragalus spatulatus, commonly known as the spoonleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has palmately divided leaves with a distinctive spoon-shaped terminal lobe, which gives it its common name. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Astragalus spatulatus is a member of the legume family (Fabaceae) and has the ability to fix nitrogen through its root nodules, contributing to soil fertility."
