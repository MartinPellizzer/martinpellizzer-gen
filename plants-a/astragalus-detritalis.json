    "intro": "Astragalus detritalis, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, yellow to reddish-brown flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and its root system is adapted to survive in dry, rocky soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife. Astragalus detritalis is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
