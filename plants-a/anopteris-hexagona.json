    "intro": "Anopteris hexagona, commonly known as the rock holly, is a perennial fern native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, hexagonal-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. Anopteris hexagona is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and resilient species."
