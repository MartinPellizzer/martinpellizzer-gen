    "intro": "Anemonastrum canadense, commonly known as Canada poppy, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Papaveraceae family and is characterized by its showy, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in wetlands, stream banks, and roadside areas. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a distinctive waxy coating, while its stems are erect and often branched. The seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds."
