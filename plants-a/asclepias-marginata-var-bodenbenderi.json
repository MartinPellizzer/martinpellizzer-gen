    "intro": "Asclepias marginata var. bodenbenderi, commonly known as the Bodenbender's milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers with distinctive, hood-like structures that attract various pollinators. Its latex sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals but serve as a defense mechanism. This variety is particularly important for the survival of the monarch butterfly, as it provides a host plant for their larvae."
