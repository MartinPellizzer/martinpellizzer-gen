    "intro": "Allium trachypus, commonly known as the bulbous leek, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and broad, grass-like leaves. The plant produces umbels of white or pale purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, onion-like flavor, making it a useful vegetable in culinary applications. However, it is less commonly cultivated than other Allium species such as garlic or leeks."
