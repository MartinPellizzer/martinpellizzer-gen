    "intro": "Angraecum talbotii, commonly known as the talbot's orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences bearing numerous fragrant, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
