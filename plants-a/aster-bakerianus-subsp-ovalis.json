It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white to pale blue. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at high elevations."
