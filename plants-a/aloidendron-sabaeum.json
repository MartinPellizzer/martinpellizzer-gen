    "intro": "Aloidendron sabaeum, commonly known as the Socotra cactus, is a unique succulent native to the island of Socotra. It features a thick, fleshy stem that can grow up to several meters in height, often branching into a tree-like structure. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Aloidendron sabaeum is notable for its distinctive appearance and is considered a living fossil due to its ancient lineage."
