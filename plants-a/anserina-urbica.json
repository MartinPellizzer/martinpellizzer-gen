It is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and urban areas, making it an adaptable species. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are palmately arranged. Anserina urbica is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in human-altered environments."
