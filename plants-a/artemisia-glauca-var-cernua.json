    "intro": "Artemisia glauca var. cernua, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features silvery-blue foliage with a fine, feathery texture, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer. The plant has a strong aromatic scent due to the presence of volatile oils in its leaves. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and wildlife habitats."
