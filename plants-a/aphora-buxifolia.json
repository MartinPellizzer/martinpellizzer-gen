    "intro": "Aphora buxifolia, commonly known as the boxleaf aphora, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features dense, compact growth with glossy, dark green leaves that are oval and slightly pointed. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the summer months. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact size and ornamental foliage. Aphora buxifolia is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it a low-maintenance addition to gardens."
