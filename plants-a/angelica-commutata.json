    "intro": "Angelica commutata, commonly known as short-stemmed angelica, is a biennial or perennial herb native to North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, umbrella-like compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late summer, which develop into small, dry fruits. Angelica commutata is often found in moist meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. It is valued for its aromatic leaves and roots, which have been used in traditional medicine and cooking."
