    "intro": "Aster ageratoides var. firmus, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its compact, mound-like growth habit and its clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces fluffy, white to grayish seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. Its foliage is typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
