    "intro": "Aulomyrcia suffruticosa var. arenaria, commonly known as the sand dune hibiscus, is a shrub-like plant native to coastal regions of the southern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, showy flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to salt spray and high winds typical of coastal environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
