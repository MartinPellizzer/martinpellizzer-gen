    "intro": "Ascotheca, commonly known as a type of cup-like structure in certain fungi, is a specialized organ that houses ascospores. It is typically found in the Ascomycota division, where it serves as the site of spore production. The ascotheca can vary in shape and size depending on the species, often being cup-shaped, flask-shaped, or spherical. It is composed of fungal hyphae that have thickened and hardened to form a protective casing. This structure plays a crucial role in the reproductive cycle of the fungus by protecting the developing spores until they are released."
