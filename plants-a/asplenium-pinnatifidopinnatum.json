    "intro": "Asplenium pinnatifidopinnatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are divided into narrow, finely toothed segments. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are short and produce a dense mat of foliage, which helps it anchor to its substrate. The spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the undersides of the fronds."
