    "intro": "Antennaria nana, commonly known as the dwarf mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in cold, rocky environments and is adapted to withstand harsh weather conditions. Its flowers are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and flies. Antennaria nana plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
