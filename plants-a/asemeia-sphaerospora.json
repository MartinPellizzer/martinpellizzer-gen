    "intro": "Asemeia sphaerospora, commonly known as the globe-spore bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its unique structure, featuring small, bladder-like organs called bladders that trap microscopic organisms. These bladders are used for nutrient absorption, allowing the plant to thrive in nutrient-poor water environments. The plant typically grows in shallow, still freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in dense inflorescences."
