    "intro": "Angraecopsis breviloba, commonly known as the small-flowered star orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its compact, hairy stems and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant produces intricate, fragrant blossoms that bloom at night, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern around the base. Angraecopsis breviloba thrives in shaded, humid environments and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its native habitat."
