    "intro": "Athyrium sheareri, commonly known as the Shearer's lady fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia, particularly China and Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories where it can thrive in cool, humid conditions. Its spores are released from small, round sporangia located on the undersides of the fronds. Athyrium sheareri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate moisture and light conditions."
