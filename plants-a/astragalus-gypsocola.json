    "intro": "Astragalus gypsocola, commonly known as the gypsum milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils, often found on rocky slopes and gypsum deposits. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus gypsocola plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is of interest in ecological restoration projects."
