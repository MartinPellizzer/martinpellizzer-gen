    "intro": "Acacia leptophylla var. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wattle, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and inland regions. It is a member of the legume family, capable of nitrogen fixation, which benefits soil fertility. Its ecological importance includes providing nectar for native pollinators and habitat for small animals.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia leptophylla var. brevifolia is primarily native to Western Australia. It is found in the southern regions of the state, particularly in the Mid-west and Great Southern districts. This plant typically grows in sandy soils and is commonly associated with coastal and inland areas. It is well adapted to the dry and temperate climate of its native range. The variety is known for its small, narrow leaves and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia leptophylla var. brevifolia was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or loamy soils and a Mediterranean climate, characterized by mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. It thrives in regions with well-drained soil and full sun exposure, making it suitable for coastal and inland environments. This plant is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value. It has been introduced to parts of southern California and the southwestern United States. However, its spread is limited due to its specific environmental requirements."
