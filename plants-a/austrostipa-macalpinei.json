    "intro": "Austrostipa macalpinei, commonly known as the Macalpine's wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a dense, tufted appearance. Austrostipa macalpinei plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small fauna in its native range."
