    "intro": "Arctagrostis latifolia var. longiglumis, commonly known as the broadleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and produces spikelets that are longer than those of the typical variety. Its inflorescence consists of a single, elongated raceme with small, two-ranked spikelets. The variety is characterized by its distinctive, elongated glumes, which contribute to its unique botanical appearance."
