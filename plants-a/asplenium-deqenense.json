    "intro": "Asplenium deqenense, commonly known as the Deqen spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in a rosette formation. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of its fertile fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Asplenium deqenense is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
