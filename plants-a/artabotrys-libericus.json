It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in summer, resembling stars, which gives it its common name. Its fruit is a fleshy capsule that splits open to release small, brown seeds. Artabotrys libericus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
