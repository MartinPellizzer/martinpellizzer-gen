    "intro": "Arnica discoidea var. alata, commonly known as the winged arnica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features erect, hairy stems that bear alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive wing-like structure on the upper surface. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers in clustered heads, which are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils at high altitudes. The species is valued for its medicinal properties, though its use is often limited due to its toxicity."
