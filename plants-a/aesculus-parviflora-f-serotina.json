    "intro": "Aesculus parviflora f. serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering horse chestnut, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with elongated leaflets and its showy, white to pinkish flowers that bloom later in the season compared to the typical horse chestnut. The plant produces spiny, capsule-like fruits containing shiny, dark brown seeds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, fertile soils. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental value and its ability to provide habitat for wildlife."
