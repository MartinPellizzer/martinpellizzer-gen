    "intro": "Agrostis hyemalis var. nutkaensis, commonly known as Nutka bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It is often found in coastal dunes and tidal zones, where it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils. Due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal, it is also cultivated in ornamental landscapes."
