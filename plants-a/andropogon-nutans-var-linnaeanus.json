    "intro": "Andropogon nutans var. linnaeanus, commonly known as the tall bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common species in prairie and savanna ecosystems. Due to its drought tolerance and ecological importance, it plays a key role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for wildlife."
