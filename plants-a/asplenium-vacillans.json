    "intro": "Asplenium vacillans, commonly known as the wavering spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that often exhibit a wavy or undulating margin, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its rhizomes are short and horizontal, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative reproduction. Asplenium vacillans is often found in temperate regions and is known for its ornamental value in horticulture."
