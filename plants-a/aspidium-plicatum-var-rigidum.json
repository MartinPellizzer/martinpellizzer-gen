    "intro": "Aspidium plicatum var. rigidum, commonly known as the rigid holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern species native to various regions in Asia. It is a perennial fern characterized by its upright, rigid fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense clumps. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. This variety is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
