    "intro": "Arenaria obtusiloba f. rosea, commonly known as the rose-flowered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and sandy soils in mountainous regions. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features tiny, clustered flowers that are typically pink or rose-colored, adding a delicate floral display. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This cultivar is prized in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny conditions."
