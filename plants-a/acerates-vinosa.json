    "intro": "Acerates vinosa, commonly known as the red vine maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and cascading branches that create a distinctive, weeping appearance. The leaves are palmately lobed, with a vibrant green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. In the fall, the tree displays striking red, orange, and yellow foliage, making it a popular ornamental species. Its small, red berries are edible but not commonly consumed by humans.",
