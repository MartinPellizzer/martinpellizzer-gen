    "intro": "Aspalathus digitifolia, commonly known as the small-leaf rooibos, is a shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and thrives in a Mediterranean climate with dry summers. It is closely related to the more famous rooibos, but differs in its smaller size and leaf structure. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in traditional medicine."
