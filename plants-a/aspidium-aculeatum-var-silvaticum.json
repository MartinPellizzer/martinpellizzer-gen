    "intro": "Aspidium aculeatum var. silvaticum, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a fern species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its sturdy, upright fronds that are often covered in small, stiff spines, giving it a rugged appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. This variety is distinguished by its slightly larger and more robust fronds compared to other varieties of Aspidium aculeatum."
