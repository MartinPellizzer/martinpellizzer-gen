It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and lanceolate leaves that are often aromatic. The plant produces greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by triangular, three-lobed fruits. The seeds inside the fruits are enclosed in a thick, aromatic aril, which is the primary part used in culinary and medicinal applications. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is valued for its essential oils and medicinal properties."
