It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. Amsinckia incongruens is often found in sandy or rocky soils along riverbanks and in desert scrub habitats."
