    "intro": "Astragalus dasycarpus, commonly known as the hairy fruit milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is well-suited to drought conditions due to its deep root system. Astragalus dasycarpus plays a role in stabilizing soil and can be used in ecological restoration projects."
