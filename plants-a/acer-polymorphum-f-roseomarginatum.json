    "intro": "Acer polymorphum f. roseomarginatum, commonly known as the rose-marginated maple, is a rare and striking variant of the polychrome maple. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, featuring pink-tinged margins on its leaves that contrast with the green or red centers. Native to the mountainous regions of western China, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its unique coloration makes it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and among plant enthusiasts. Due to its limited natural range and susceptibility to environmental stress, it is considered a conservation concern.",
