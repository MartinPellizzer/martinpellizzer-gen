    "intro": "Argyreia obtecta var. obtusifolia, commonly known as the velvet tare or velvet leaf, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, velvety leaves that are typically dark green with a soft, fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by orange-red berries that contain seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often grown as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it requires careful management in natural habitats."
