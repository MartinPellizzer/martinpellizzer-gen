    "intro": "Agrostis czernjaginae, commonly known as the Czernjagina's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its fine, narrow leaves and compact inflorescences. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
