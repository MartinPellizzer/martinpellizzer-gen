It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its showy white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible berries that ripen in late summer, turning from red to dark purple. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and turn yellow in the fall, adding to its ornamental value.
