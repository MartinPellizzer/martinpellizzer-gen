    "intro": "Anemone pratensis subsp. nigricans, commonly known as the black anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks, preferring partial to full shade. The plant features showy, cup-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, with dark veins and a distinctive black center. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the plant produces a basal rosette of foliage. The subspecies is distinguished by its darker flower coloration compared to the typical form of A. pratensis."
