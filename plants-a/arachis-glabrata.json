    "intro": "Arachis glabrata, commonly known as the smooth peanut, is a leguminous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, with small yellow flowers that develop into pods containing edible seeds. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, improving soil fertility. It thrives in warm climates and is cultivated for its high-protein seeds, which are used in various food products. However, it is less commonly grown commercially compared to other peanut species."
