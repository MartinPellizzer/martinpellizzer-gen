    "intro": "Acaena pinnatifida var. humilior, commonly known as the dwarf New Zealand knapweed, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It features small, palmately lobed leaves that are typically hairy and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by spherical, prickly fruits known as achenes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of New Zealand's native flora.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena pinnatifida var. humilior is primarily native to New Zealand. It is commonly found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury and Otago regions. This variant thrives in dry, open habitats such as tussock grasslands and rocky outcrops. It is often associated with lowland and subalpine environments. The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate and nutrient-poor soils of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena pinnatifida var. humilior was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. The plant has since become naturalized and is now found in various habitats across the country. It is commonly associated with disturbed soils and can be found in grasslands and forest margins. However, it is not considered invasive and has limited impact on native ecosystems."
