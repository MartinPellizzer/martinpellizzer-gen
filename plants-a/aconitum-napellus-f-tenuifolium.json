    "intro": "Aconitum napellus f. tenuifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It features striking purple to blue flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape, typical of the genus Aconitum. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are narrower than those of the typical A. napellus, giving it its distinguishing feature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
