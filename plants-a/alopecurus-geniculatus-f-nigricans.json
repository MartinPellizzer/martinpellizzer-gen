    "intro": "Alopecurus geniculatus f. nigricans, commonly known as the black-stemmed bentgrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its dark, often purplish stems. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as meadows and wetlands. The plant has fine, narrow leaves and produces small, greenish or brownish spikelets in clusters. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation. This variety is notable for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wet areas."
