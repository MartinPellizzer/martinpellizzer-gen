    "intro": "Acetosa subalpina, commonly known as alpine sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically features a rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are edible and have a slightly sour taste due to their high oxalic acid content. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, and it thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes. Acetosa subalpina is often found in meadows, rocky slopes, and mountainous areas where it can tolerate harsh weather conditions. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in alpine ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies.",
