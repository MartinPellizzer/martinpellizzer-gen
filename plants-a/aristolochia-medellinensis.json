    "intro": "Aristolochia medellinensis, commonly known as the Medellin Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and its unique, pipe-like flowers that are often greenish-yellow in color. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe. It is a member of the Aristolochiaceae family and is known for its complex floral structure that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
