    "intro": "Alnus viridis lusus glabra, commonly known as the smooth alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape and have a smooth, glabrous surface. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers that are typically yellow-green in color, followed by spherical fruits containing one or two winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Alnus viridis lusus glabra plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life."
