It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, tree-like structure with a stout trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its fronds can grow up to several meters in length, making it a striking addition to botanical gardens.
