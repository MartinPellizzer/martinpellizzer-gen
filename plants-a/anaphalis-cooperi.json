    "intro": "Anaphalis cooperi, commonly known as the silverleaf frostflower, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are typically silver-gray, covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Anaphalis cooperi is often found in open woods, fields, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
