    "intro": "Acrostichum tenerum, commonly known as the soft fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a soft, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, though its primary botanical interest lies in its unique morphology and ecological role. Acrostichum tenerum is a member of the family Blechnaceae, which includes other primitive ferns with similar structural features.",
