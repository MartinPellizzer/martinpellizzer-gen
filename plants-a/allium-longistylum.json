It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces bulbous structures that are often used in culinary applications, similar to other allium species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value and edible parts, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
