    "intro": "Andromeda polifolia subsp. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged in a compact, mat-like form. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red berries. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and rocky areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
