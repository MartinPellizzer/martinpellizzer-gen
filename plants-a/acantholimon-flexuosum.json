    "intro": "Acantholimon flexuosum, commonly known as the flexible sandthrift, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the western United States. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features slender, often branching stems and small, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters and blooming in late spring to early summer. Acantholimon flexuosum is well adapted to sandy and gravelly soils, making it a common sight in desert and coastal dunes.",

This plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as rocky slopes and gravelly soils. It is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of these areas. Its distribution is limited to certain ecological niches within Iran.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon flexuosum was mainly introduced to disturbed soils and rocky outcrops in arid and semi-arid regions. It thrives in environments with low moisture and high sunlight exposure. This plant is often found along roadsides, construction sites, and areas with human activity. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions outside its native range. It is considered a weed in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
