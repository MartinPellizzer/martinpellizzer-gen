    "intro": "Angelica dilatata, commonly known as the broadleaf angelica, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length, with a distinctive heart-shaped base. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in late summer, which are followed by spherical, spiky fruits. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Angelica dilatata is valued for its aromatic foliage and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
