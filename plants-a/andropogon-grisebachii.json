    "intro": "Andropogon grisebachii, commonly known as gray bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands and prairies, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant has narrow, bluish-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with purple or red. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it valuable for erosion control. Gray bluestem is also an important forage plant for grazing animals."
