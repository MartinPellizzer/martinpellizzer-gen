    "intro": "Acaena pinnatifida var. pallidiflora, commonly known as the pale-flowered burr bush, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive, spiny fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest margins and along stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena pinnatifida var. pallidiflora is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the northern and central regions of the country. This variant thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often in sandy or gravelly soils. It is commonly associated with coastal scrub and dunes. The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate and salt-laden winds of its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena pinnatifida var. pallidiflora was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as a ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. However, it has since become an invasive species, outcompeting native vegetation in certain areas. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in coastal and forested regions. Its establishment has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to alter local ecosystems."
