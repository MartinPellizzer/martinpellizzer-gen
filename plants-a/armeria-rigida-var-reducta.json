    "intro": "Armeria rigida var. reducta, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the rocky coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid, saline environment. It is well adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
