It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers that are typically arranged in racemes, and its leaves are deeply lobed and palmate. Aconitum zooctonum is known for its toxic alkaloids, which make it a dangerous plant to handle. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats.",
