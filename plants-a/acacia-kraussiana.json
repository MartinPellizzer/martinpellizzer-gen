    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia kraussiana is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe. It is commonly found in savanna and woodland habitats, often in areas with well-drained soils. This species thrives in regions with a tropical or subtropical climate, characterized by distinct wet and dry seasons. It is often seen growing along riverbanks and in open grasslands. Acacia kraussiana is an important component of the local flora and provides habitat and food for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia kraussiana was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and along roadsides, particularly in the Western and Eastern Cape provinces. This plant is known for its ability to thrive in harsh, arid conditions, making it a resilient species in these environments. However, its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in some ecosystems. Despite its ecological impact, Acacia kraussiana is valued for its ornamental qualities and role in soil stabilization."
