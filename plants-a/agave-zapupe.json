    "intro": "Agave zapupe, commonly known as the Zapupe agave, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its robust, spiky leaves that form a rosette shape, typical of many agave species. The plant produces a tall flower stalk that bears white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom in the summer months. Its thick, fleshy leaves store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Agave zapupe is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in local cultures."
