    "intro": "Avena sativa var. culinaris, commonly known as barley, is a species of grass that is widely cultivated for its edible grains. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical spikes that bear small, hard grains. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and has narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the grains develop in dense clusters at the end of the stem. Barley is adapted to temperate climates and is often grown in regions with cool, moist conditions."
