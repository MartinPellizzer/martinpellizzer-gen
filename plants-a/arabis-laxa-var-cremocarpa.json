    "intro": "Arabis laxa var. cremocarpa, commonly known as the creeping rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders."
