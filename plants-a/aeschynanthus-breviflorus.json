    "intro": "Aeschynanthus breviflorus, commonly known as the short-flowered winged ivy, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a trailing evergreen shrub characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically bright red or orange, which bloom in clusters along the stems. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in hanging baskets."
