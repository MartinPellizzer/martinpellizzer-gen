    "intro": "Alisma submersum var. arcuatum, commonly known as the curved water plantain, is a semi-aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and wetlands. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often submerged, with some floating on the water surface. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in dense spikes, and it produces berries that are dispersed by water. This variant is characterized by its curved leaf morphology, which distinguishes it from other varieties of Alisma."
