    "intro": "Aspidium callipteris, commonly known as the broad-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that are typically green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to substrates like soil or rocks. Aspidium callipteris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
