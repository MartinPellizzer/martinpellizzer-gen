    "intro": "Anthistiria syriaca, commonly known as the Syrian anthistiria, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Syria. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
