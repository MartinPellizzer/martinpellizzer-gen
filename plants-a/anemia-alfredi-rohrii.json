    "intro": "Anemia alfredi-rohrii, commonly known as the Alpine snowbell, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to cold, mountainous environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
