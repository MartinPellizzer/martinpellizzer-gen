    "intro": "Anguloa uniflora var. maculata, commonly known as the spotted anguloa, is a striking bulbous plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, white, and red, with distinctive spots or markings. The plant features strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention in its native habitat. It thrives in cool, humid conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and greenhouses as a prized flowering plant."
