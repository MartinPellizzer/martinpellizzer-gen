    "intro": "Agrostis capillaris var. hispida, commonly known as hairy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and the presence of short, stiff hairs on its leaves and stems. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce numerous tiny flowers, contributing to its role in ecological systems. Hairy bentgrass is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, low-growing lawns."
