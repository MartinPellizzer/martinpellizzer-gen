    "intro": "Althaea mexicana, commonly known as Mexican marshmallow, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and stream banks. The plant features showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are soft and often covered in a sticky substance. Althaea mexicana is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its mucilage-rich roots."
