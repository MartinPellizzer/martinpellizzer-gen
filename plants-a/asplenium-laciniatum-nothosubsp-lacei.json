    "intro": "Asplenium laciniatum nothosubsp. lacei, commonly known as the lace fern, is a fern species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds that give it a delicate, ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, linear pinnae that contribute to its intricate foliage. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori."
