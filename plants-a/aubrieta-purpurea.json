    "intro": "Aubrieta purpurea, commonly known as purple rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, mat-forming growth with bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that help it survive in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Aubrieta purpurea is valued for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
