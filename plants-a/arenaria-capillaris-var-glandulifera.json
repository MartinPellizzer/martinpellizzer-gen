    "intro": "Arenaria capillaris var. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to dry, sandy soils in temperate regions. It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in glandular hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early spring, which are typically borne on short, erect stems. Its root system is fibrous and adapted for anchoring in loose, well-drained soils. This variant is often found in disturbed areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
