    "intro": "Anarthrophyllum andicola var. bridgesii, commonly known as the Andean rock cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, clustered rosettes of dark green, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
