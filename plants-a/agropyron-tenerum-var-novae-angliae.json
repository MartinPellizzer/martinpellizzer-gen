    "intro": "Agropyron tenerum var. novae-angliae, commonly known as New England wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the northeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and along streambanks. The plant has slender, tufted shoots with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
