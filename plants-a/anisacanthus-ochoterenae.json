    "intro": "Anisacanthus ochoterenae, commonly known as the Mexican firecracker plant, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, tubular red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
