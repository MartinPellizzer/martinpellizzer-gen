    "intro": "Acaena nudicaulis, commonly known as the slender spinulose burr, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, woody fruits called achenes, which are covered in hooked bristles that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a hairy texture. Acaena nudicaulis thrives in dry, sunny environments and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena nudicaulis is primarily native to New Zealand. It is commonly found in the North Island and parts of the South Island. This plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, shrublands, and coastal areas. It is often associated with disturbed soils and can be found in both lowland and alpine regions. Acaena nudicaulis plays an important ecological role in New Zealand's native ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena nudicaulis was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century. The plant was initially planted for ornamental purposes due to its attractive yellow flowers. However, it has since become an invasive species in some regions of New Zealand. Its spread has raised concerns due to its ability to outcompete native vegetation."
