    "intro": "Andicolea lycopodinea, commonly known as the mossy clubmoss, is a small, primitive plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spores in cone-like structures called strobili, which are typically found at the tips of the branches. Andicolea lycopodinea thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its simple morphology reflects its ancient lineage, dating back to the Paleozoic era."
