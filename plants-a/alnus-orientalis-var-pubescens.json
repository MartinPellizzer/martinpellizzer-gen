    "intro": "Alnus orientalis var. pubescens, commonly known as the eastern alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that are typically hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged fruits that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along streambanks. This species is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration projects."
