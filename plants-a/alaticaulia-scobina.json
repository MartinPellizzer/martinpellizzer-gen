    "intro": "Alaticaulia scobina, commonly known as the woolly broom. It is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa, characterized by its dense, woody stems covered in a thick layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are small, leathery, and often appear in pairs along the stems. Alaticaulia scobina is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from underground sources."
