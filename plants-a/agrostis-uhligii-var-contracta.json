    "intro": "Agrostis uhligii var. contracta, commonly known as the narrowleaf bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its slender, compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly curled. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and ecological restoration projects."
