    "intro": "Amaryllis purpurea var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf amaryllis, is a compact, bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features striking, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, often with a contrasting throat. The plant produces foliage consisting of strap-like, evergreen leaves that emerge from the base of the bulb. It blooms in late spring to early summer, making it a popular choice for container gardening. Due to its smaller size, it is well-suited for indoor cultivation and small garden spaces."
