    "intro": "Aceras maculatum, commonly known as the spotted bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy and have a slightly rough texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies.",
