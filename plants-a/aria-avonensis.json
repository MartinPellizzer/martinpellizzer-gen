    "intro": "Aria avonensis, commonly known as Avon's arrowhead, is a rare aquatic plant native to the UK. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. The plant has slender, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the mud. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
