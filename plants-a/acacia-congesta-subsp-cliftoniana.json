This subspecies is found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in the area around the Fitzgerald River National Park. It typically grows in sandy soils and is commonly associated with coastal and near-coastal environments. The plant is well adapted to the dry and often windy conditions of its native habitat. It is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in the ecological balance of the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia congesta subsp. cliftoniana was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has been established in certain regions. It is commonly found in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces. This subspecies is adapted to semi-arid and coastal environments. It is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and hardiness. However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas."
