    "intro": "Asclepias amplexicaulis, commonly known as the clustered milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that often wrap around the stem, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish flowers, which are arranged in umbels and attract various pollinators. It is a host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing essential nourishment for monarch caterpillars. The latex sap of this plant is toxic and can cause skin irritation in humans."
