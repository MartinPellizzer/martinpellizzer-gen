    "intro": "Asplundianthus sagasteguii, commonly known as the Sagastegui's asplundia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a somewhat leathery texture, adapted to the harsh climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
