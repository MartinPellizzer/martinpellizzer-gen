    "intro": "Arthratherum lutescens, commonly known as yellow hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces small, yellowish-green spikelets that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slight waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Arthratherum lutescens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
