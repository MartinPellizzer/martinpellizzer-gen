It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous regions. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a rough texture and a distinct, sometimes hairy appearance. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling as it contains toxic alkaloids."
