    "intro": "Adiantum lobulatum, commonly known as the golden maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green with a slight golden hue. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its fronds are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller segments twice, creating a finely textured appearance. Adiantum lobulatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.",
