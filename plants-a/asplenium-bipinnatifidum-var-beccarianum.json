    "intro": "Asplenium bipinnatifidum var. beccarianum, commonly known as the Beccarian holly fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its fronds are bipinnatifid, meaning they are divided twice, with narrow, linear segments. The varietal form beccarianum is distinguished by its specific leaf morphology and habitat preferences."
