    "intro": "Aralia nudicaulis var. prolifera, commonly known as the creeping aralia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to eastern North America. It features small, compound leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with each leaflet being finely toothed. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, umbel-like flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. This variant is characterized by its prolific growth habit, making it a common ground cover in its native habitat."
