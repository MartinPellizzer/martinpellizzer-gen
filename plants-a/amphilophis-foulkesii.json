It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features grass-like leaves that are narrow and linear, with a distinct central vein. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it produces three-sided, three-rowed berries. Amphilophis foulkesii plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
