It features dense clusters of basal leaves that are shield-shaped and covered in soft, silvery-white hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in panicles. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates. This variety is valued for its ornamental foliage and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
