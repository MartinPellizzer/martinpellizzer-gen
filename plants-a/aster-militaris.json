It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its bright yellow to orange flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Aster militaris is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
