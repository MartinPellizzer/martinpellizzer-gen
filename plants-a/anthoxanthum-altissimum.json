    "intro": "Anthoxanthum altissimum, commonly known as the tall oat or false oat, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous florets. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces pale yellow to brown flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it can form dense stands. Botanically, it is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
