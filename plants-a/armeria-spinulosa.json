    "intro": "Armeria spinulosa, commonly known as the spiked thrift, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, silver-gray leaves that are often covered in fine, spinulose hairs. Armeria spinulosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
