    "intro": "Asplenium pumilum, commonly known as the small spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to various regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices, walls, and forest floors. The plant features a compact rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of moss-like growth. Its sporangia are clustered on the undersides of the leaves, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Asplenium pumilum is well adapted to humid conditions and is often found in association with other epiphytic or lithophytic plants."
