    "intro": "Astragalus triflorus var. insularis, commonly known as the island milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers and trifoliate leaves, which are typical of the Astragalus genus. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements make it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
