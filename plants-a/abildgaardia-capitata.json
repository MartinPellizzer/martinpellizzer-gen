    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abildgaardia capitata is primarily native to the island of Saba in the Caribbean. It is found in the tropical rainforests of this small island nation. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments within the understory of the forest. It is not found anywhere else in the world, making it a unique endemic species. Its distribution is limited to the specific ecological conditions of Saba.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abildgaardia capitata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in natural ecosystems. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and outcompetes native species. Its distribution is now a concern for environmental management in the region."
