    "intro": "Anoectochilus candidus, commonly known as the White Orchid, is a rare and endangered epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, fragrant scent. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, relying on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are usually elliptical and covered with a dense, velvety pubescence. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically threatened in the wild, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
