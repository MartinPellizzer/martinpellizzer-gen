    "intro": "Adenogonum, commonly known as the yellow bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its striking yellow or orange flowers that resemble bells, which are typically tubular in shape. The plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. Adenogonum species often grow as shrubs or small trees, and they may have opposite or alternate leaf arrangements. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
