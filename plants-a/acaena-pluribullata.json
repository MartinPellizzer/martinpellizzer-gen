    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena pluribullata is primarily native to the South Island of New Zealand. It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as shrublands, grasslands, and rocky areas. This species is adapted to the temperate climate and diverse topography of the region. It plays an important ecological role in its native environment. However, it is not widely distributed and is considered a rare plant within its range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena pluribullata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of early European agricultural and horticultural practices. The plant is now considered invasive in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It thrives in a variety of soil types and can tolerate both full sun and partial shade. Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its impact on local ecosystems."
