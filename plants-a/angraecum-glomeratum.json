    "intro": "Angraecum glomeratum, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It features long, slender green stems with clusters of fragrant, white to pale violet flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces numerous small, elongated pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding its survival in its arid environment. Its flowers have a unique structure with long, narrow petals and a prominent, spurred lip. Angraecum glomeratum is well adapted to the specific climatic conditions of its native habitat, requiring periods of drought followed by heavy rainfall."
