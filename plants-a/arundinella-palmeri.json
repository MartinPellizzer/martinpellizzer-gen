It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in sandy or rocky soils. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets. Its botanical features make it well adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions."
