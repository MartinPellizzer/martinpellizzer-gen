    "intro": "Aspidium exaltatum var. hirsutulum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a variant of the broad shield fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a robust and sturdy structure. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, typical of the fern family."
