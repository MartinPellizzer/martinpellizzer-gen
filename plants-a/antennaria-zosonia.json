    "intro": "Antennaria zosonia, commonly known as the Antarctic pearlwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the cold climates of the Southern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a compact rosette structure with hairy leaves that help insulate it against harsh environmental conditions. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subantarctic regions. Due to its specialized adaptations, it plays a significant role in the ecosystems of its native habitats."
