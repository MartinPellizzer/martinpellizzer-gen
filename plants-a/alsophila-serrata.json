    "intro": "Alsophila serrata, commonly known as the serrated tree fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of fronds that are deeply divided and serrated. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, providing structural support and enabling it to thrive in humid conditions. The fronds are evergreen, contributing to the plant's ornamental value in landscaping and horticulture."
