    "intro": "Adesmia incana var. incana, commonly known as the silverleaf adesmia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a shrub characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescent hairs covering its leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Its ornamental value is due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.",
