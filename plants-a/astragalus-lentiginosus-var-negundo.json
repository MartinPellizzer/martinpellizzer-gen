    "intro": "Astragalus lentiginosus var. negundo, commonly known as the black milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with stipules and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects for stabilizing degraded lands."
