    "intro": "Athyrium scotinum, commonly known as the Scottish wood fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into multiple pinnae, giving it a finely textured appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns. Athyrium scotinum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
