    "intro": "Androsace lowariensis, commonly known as the Alpine mouse-ear, is a small, mat-forming perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its rosettes of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in the spring, which are often borne on short, hairy pedicels. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
