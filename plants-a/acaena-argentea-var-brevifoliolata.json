    "intro": "Acaena argentea var. brevifoliolata, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It features small, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by small, spiny fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects for soil stabilization.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena argentea var. brevifoliolata is primarily native to southern South America, including parts of Chile and Argentina. It is commonly found in temperate regions with a Mediterranean climate. This plant thrives in coastal and mountainous areas, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils. It is well adapted to the variable environmental conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is largely restricted to the southern Andes and adjacent coastal areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena argentea var. brevifoliolata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive silver foliage and compact growth habit. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through its seeds. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to alter local biodiversity."
