    "intro": "Apozia chamaedryoides, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to form dense, decorative ground covers."
