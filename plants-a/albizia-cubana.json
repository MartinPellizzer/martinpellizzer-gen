    "intro": "Albizia cubana, commonly known as the Cuban silk tree, is a deciduous leguminous shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by flat, pod-like fruits. Albizia cubana is adapted to coastal and dry habitats, often found in sandy soils along the shores of Cuba and other nearby islands. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
