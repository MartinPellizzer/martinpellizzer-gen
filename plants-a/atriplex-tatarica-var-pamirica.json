It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to arid and saline environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This variant is closely related to other members of the Chenopodiaceae family and is valued for its hardiness and ecological resilience."
