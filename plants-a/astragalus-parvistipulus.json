    "intro": "Astragalus parvistipulus, commonly known as the small-stipule milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, stipitate leaves and unique floral structure make it a distinctive member of the Astragalus genus. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
