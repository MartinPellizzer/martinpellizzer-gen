    "intro": "Acalypha berteroana, commonly known as the red bower vine, is a flowering plant native to Central America and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its striking red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant foliage. Acalypha berteroana is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha berteroana is primarily native to Puerto Rico. It is commonly found in the island's coastal areas and lowland regions. This plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often seen along the shores. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Its presence is a key indicator of the unique biodiversity found in Puerto Rico's natural landscapes.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha berteroana was mainly introduced to the Hawaiian Islands. It is considered an invasive species there, often outcompeting native plants for resources. The plant thrives in disturbed habitats such as coastal areas and dry forests. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a significant ecological threat. Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect native biodiversity."
