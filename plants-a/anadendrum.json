It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plants are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. They have thick, fleshy leaves that help conserve water in dry environments. Anadendrum species are typically shrubs or small trees, often growing in rocky soils and along stream banks."
