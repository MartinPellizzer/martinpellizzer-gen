    "intro": "Acer tenellum, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow in autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of 6 to 12 meters, with a rounded crown and smooth, gray bark. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. Acer tenellum prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.",
