    "intro": "Alsine macrocarpa lusus brevipedunculata, commonly known as the short-stemmed alsike, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
