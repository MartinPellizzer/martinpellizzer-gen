    "intro": "Androsace dubyi, commonly known as the Duby's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
