    "intro": "Alloneuron subglabrum, commonly known as the smooth alloneuron, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, though the species name \"subglabrum\" suggests a reduction in hairiness. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant's botanical features make it a subject of interest in both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
