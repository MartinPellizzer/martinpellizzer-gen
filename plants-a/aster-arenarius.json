    "intro": "Aster arenarius, commonly known as the sand aster, is a flowering plant native to arid and sandy environments in North America. It produces small, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming habit with hairy, narrow leaves adapted to reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and coastal dunes. Aster arenarius plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
