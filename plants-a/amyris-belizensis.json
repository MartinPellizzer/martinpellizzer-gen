    "intro": "Amyris belizensis, commonly known as the Belize sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its slender trunk, smooth gray bark, and aromatic, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers followed by woody, fragrant capsules containing dark brown seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its unique fragrance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
