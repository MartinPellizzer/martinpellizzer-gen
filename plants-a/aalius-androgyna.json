    "intro": "Aalius androgyna, commonly known as the dual-sex blossom, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It exhibits unique botanical features, including a single flower that develops both male and female reproductive structures simultaneously. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its cool, humid environment. Its blooming cycle occurs once every three years, making it a subject of fascination for botanists. The dual-sex nature of its flowers has led to ongoing research into its genetic and ecological significance.",
