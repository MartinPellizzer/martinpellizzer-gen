It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open grasslands and along rocky outcrops, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
