    "intro": "Arenaria orbiculata, commonly known as the cushion sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early summer, which are typically arranged in compact, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its compact form and ability to withstand extreme conditions make it an important component of alpine and tundra ecosystems."
