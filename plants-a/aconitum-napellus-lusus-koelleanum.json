    "intro": "Aconitum napellus lusus koelleanum, commonly known as the Koelreuter's aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafed stems that bear dense clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant contains potent alkaloids, such as aconitine, which make it highly toxic and dangerous if ingested. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in woodland environments. Due to its toxicity, it is often cultivated in gardens with caution and care.",
