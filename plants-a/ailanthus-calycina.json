    "intro": "Ailanthus calycina, commonly known as the white-flowered ailanthus, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a distinctive, finely serrated edge. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters during the spring, followed by elongated, winged fruits that disperse its seeds by wind. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest edges. Ailanthus calycina is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
