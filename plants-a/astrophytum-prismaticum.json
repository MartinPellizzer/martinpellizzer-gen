    "intro": "Astrophytum prismaticum, commonly known as the prismatic star cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to the Sonoran Desert of Mexico. It features a ribbed, spiny stem with a distinctive prismatic coloration that ranges from blue-green to purple, especially when exposed to sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
