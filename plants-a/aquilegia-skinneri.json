It features showy, spurred flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, with five petals and two elongated nectar-rich spurs. The plant has compound leaves with lobed or divided foliage, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it blooms in late spring to early summer. Skinner's columbine is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for pollinators."
