    "intro": "Anisochilus glaber, commonly known as the naked leaf fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its simple, unbranched fronds that lack the typical pinnae found in many ferns, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Anisochilus glaber thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in its natural habitat."
