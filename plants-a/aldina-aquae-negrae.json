    "intro": "Aldina aquae-negrae, commonly known as the black water plant, is a rare aquatic species native to the humid lowland regions of South America. It thrives in stagnant or slow-moving water bodies with high organic content, often found in murky, nutrient-rich environments. The plant's dark green leaves are adapted to absorb limited light, and its roots help stabilize the sediment. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects, and its seeds are dispersed by water currents. Due to habitat destruction, Aldina aquae-negrae is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
