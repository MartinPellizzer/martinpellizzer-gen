    "intro": "Agropyron angustiglume, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats or tufts. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh, dry environments. Agropyron angustiglume is also valued for its potential in erosion control and as a forage crop."
