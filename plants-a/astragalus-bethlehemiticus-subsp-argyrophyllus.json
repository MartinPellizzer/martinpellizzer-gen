    "intro": "Astragalus bethlehemiticus subsp. argyrophyllus, commonly known as the silver-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
