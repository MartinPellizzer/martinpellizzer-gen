It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically evergreen and have a distinctive reddish or purple hue on the underside. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry forests and mountainous regions. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
