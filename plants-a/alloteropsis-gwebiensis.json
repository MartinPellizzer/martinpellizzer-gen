    "intro": "Alloteropsis gwebiensis, commonly known as the Gwebi grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in restoration projects and as a forage crop in dry regions."
