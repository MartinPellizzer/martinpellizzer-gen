    "intro": "Artemisia komarovii, commonly known as Chinese wormwood, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It is characterized by its gray-green, aromatic foliage and small, yellowish-green flower heads. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves, have been used in traditional medicine for their antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. Artemisia komarovii is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in dry environments."
