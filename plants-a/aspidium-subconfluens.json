    "intro": "Aspidium subconfluens, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions, particularly in eastern North America. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and they are grouped in clusters. Aspidium subconfluens plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
