    "intro": "Araucaria araucana f. virgata, commonly known as the Patagonian cedar or the Andean cedar, is a rare and unique form of the Araucaria araucana, native to the Andes Mountains of South America. This variety is distinguished by its slender, columnar growth habit and its longer, more drooping needles compared to the typical form. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and conical shape, which makes it a striking ornamental plant. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, humid climates with well-drained soils. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
