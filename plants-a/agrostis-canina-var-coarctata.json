    "intro": "Agrostis canina var. coarctata, commonly known as narrowleaf bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its growth habit is clump-forming, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates."
