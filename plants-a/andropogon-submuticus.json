    "intro": "Andropogon submuticus, commonly known as inland needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of 1 to 3 meters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, sandpapery texture on the upper surface. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with red or brown. Andropogon submuticus is adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in native plant communities."
