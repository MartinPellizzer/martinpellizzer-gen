    "intro": "Atropa daturifolia, commonly known as the pale belladonna, is a striking plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range from white to pale purple. The plant produces toxic berries that contain tropane alkaloids, making it highly poisonous to both humans and animals. While it is valued for its ornamental appeal, its cultivation requires caution due to its potent chemical composition. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or dry environments."
