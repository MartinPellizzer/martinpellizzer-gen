    "intro": "Ajuga nanti, commonly known as carpet grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces clusters of tiny, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Ajuga nanti thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ground-covering ability. It is also valued for its ability to suppress weeds and improve soil stability in woodland areas."
