    "intro": "Acacia catenulata subsp. occidentalis, commonly known as the western acacia, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, bean-like pods. The plant produces yellow flowers in winter, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous tiny, needle-like leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions.",

This subspecies typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is commonly seen in shrublands and open woodlands. The plant is well-suited to the climate and soil conditions of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia catenulata subsp. occidentalis was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and on sandy soils, particularly in the Western Cape. This subspecies is valued for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in arid conditions. It has been used in ornamental horticulture and for soil stabilization in degraded landscapes. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in local ecosystems."
