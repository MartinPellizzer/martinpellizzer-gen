    "intro": "Acer haplolobum, commonly known as the mountain maple, is a deciduous tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which are typically opposite and have a distinctive, finely toothed margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. The mountain maple is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in forest ecosystems.",
