    "intro": "Arabis lucens, commonly known as the white rockcress, is a flowering plant native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant features basal rosettes of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. It is typically found in crevices and on slopes, thriving in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Arabis lucens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
