    "intro": "Anthonotha, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through deep root systems and water-storing tissues. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Anthonotha is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
