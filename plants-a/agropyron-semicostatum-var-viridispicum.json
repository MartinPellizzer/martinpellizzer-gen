    "intro": "Agropyron semicostatum var. viridispicum, commonly known as the green-awned wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and steppe environments. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is occasionally used in ecological restoration projects."
