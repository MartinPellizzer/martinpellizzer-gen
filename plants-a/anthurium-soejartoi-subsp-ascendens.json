    "intro": "Anthurium soejartoi subsp. ascendens, commonly known as the climbing anthurium, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with prominent veins. The plant produces vivid red spathes that enclose its spadix, which is a typical feature of the Araceae family. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This subspecies is popular among collectors for its ornamental value and unique foliage."
