    "intro": "Arachis sesquijuga, commonly known as the Brazilian peanut or wild peanut, is a species of legume native to South America. It is a herbaceous annual plant that produces small, yellow flowers and develops pods containing edible seeds. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is closely related to the cultivated peanut (Arachis hypogaea) and is often found in disturbed habitats. Its botanical features make it an important subject in studies of plant genetics and evolution."
