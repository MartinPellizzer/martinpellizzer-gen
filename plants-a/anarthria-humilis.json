    "intro": "Anarthria humilis, commonly known as the lowland anarthria, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, commonly known as the palm family, and is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of many palm species. Its leaves are pinnate, with long, narrow leaflets that give it a feathery appearance. Anarthria humilis is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and swampy areas."
