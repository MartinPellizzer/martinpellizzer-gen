    "intro": "Acer rubrum var. drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's red maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental species. The leaves are typically ovate with a coarsely toothed margin and turn brilliant shades of red, orange, and yellow in autumn. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and wetlands. The tree produces small, red samaras that disperse its seeds, contributing to its natural spread.",
