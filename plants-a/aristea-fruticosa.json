    "intro": "Aristea fruticosa, commonly known as the rock aster, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features dense, wiry stems covered in soft, grayish hairs, and its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine pubescence. It produces clusters of small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
