    "intro": "Avena elatior var. pauciflora, commonly known as the slender oat, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and reduced flowering, with fewer spikelets compared to other oat species. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain a limited number of flowers, which is reflected in its varietal name \"pauciflora.\" Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it thrives in well-drained soils. This variety is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
