    "intro": "Arcyphyllum, commonly known as the mountain sage or desert sage, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the western United States and parts of Canada. The plants are characterized by their aromatic foliage and showy yellow or purple flowers that bloom in summer. Arcyphyllum species are typically shrubs or subshrubs with narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to withstand drought and intense sunlight. They play an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
