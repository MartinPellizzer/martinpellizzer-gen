    "intro": "Alyssum moellendorfianum, commonly known as the silverleaf alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a favored plant in both landscaping and horticultural collections."
