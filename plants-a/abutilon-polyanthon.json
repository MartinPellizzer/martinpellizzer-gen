    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon polyanthon is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in disturbed areas like roadsides and open forests. This plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often associated with lowland and coastal habitats. It is also occasionally found in parts of southern China and the Philippines. Its native range extends across various islands in the Indo-Pacific region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon polyanthon was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and showy flowers. The plant has since become naturalized in wetland and riparian areas throughout the region. It is often found along stream banks and in moist, disturbed soils. However, its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation."
