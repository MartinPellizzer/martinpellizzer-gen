    "intro": "Andropogon purpurascens, commonly known as purple bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that turn a striking purplish hue in the fall. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color during the growing season. It produces small, fluffy seed heads that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread. Purple bluestem is often found in open woodlands and prairies, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
