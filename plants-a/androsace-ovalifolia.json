    "intro": "Androsace ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaved sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats, with succulent, often hairy leaves arranged in a rosette. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which are clustered in a single terminal inflorescence. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
