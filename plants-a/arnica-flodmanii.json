    "intro": "Arnica flodmanii, commonly known as the alpine arnica, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. Arnica flodmanii is valued for its medicinal properties, though it is not as widely used as other arnica species."
