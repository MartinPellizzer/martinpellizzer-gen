    "intro": "Adiantum crespianum, commonly known as the crested maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often arched or curled. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots that help anchor it in the soil. The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.",
