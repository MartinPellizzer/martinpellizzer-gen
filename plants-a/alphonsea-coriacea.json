    "intro": "Alphonsea coriacea, commonly known as the rough alphonse, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rough, bark-like texture on its stems and leaves, which are typically elliptical and leathery. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by elliptical, smooth, and glossy fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a waxy surface that reflects light. Alphonsea coriacea is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils."
