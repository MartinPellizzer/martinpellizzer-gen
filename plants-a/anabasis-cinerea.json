    "intro": "Anabasis cinerea, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It has small, pale green to grayish leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Anabasis cinerea is adapted to harsh desert conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
