    "intro": "Astragalus algarbiensis, commonly known as the Algarbi milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow to reddish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry, rocky soils and is often found in steppe and semi-desert environments. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and important species in its native habitats."
