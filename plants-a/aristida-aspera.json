    "intro": "Aristida aspera, commonly known as rough bluestem, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically greenish or purplish in color. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. Aristida aspera is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
