    "intro": "Astragalus leucopsis var. asymmetricus, commonly known as the asymmetric milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its unique floral structure and variation in leaf morphology make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
