    "intro": "Aristida stricta var. condensata, commonly known as the dense false brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, giving it a distinctive, compact appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
