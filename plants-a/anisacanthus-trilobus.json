    "intro": "Anisacanthus trilobus, commonly known as the flameleaf hedgehog, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are usually green with a reddish or purple underside, contributing to its ornamental value. It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal."
