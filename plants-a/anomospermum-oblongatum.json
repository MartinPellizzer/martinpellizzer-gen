    "intro": "Anomospermum oblongatum, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in complex inflorescences called cyathia. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its unique appearance and resilience."
