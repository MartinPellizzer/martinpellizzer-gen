It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, elongated fruits. Its extensive root system helps stabilize the soil in its natural habitat. Due to its size and ornamental features, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
