    "intro": "Aster laeviformis, commonly known as the smoothleaf aster, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely toothed, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the fall. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It is a perennial herb that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Aster laeviformis plays an important role in supporting pollinators during the late summer and early autumn seasons."
