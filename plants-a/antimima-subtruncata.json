    "intro": "Antimima subtruncata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandbur, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, spiny fruit capsules that contain seeds. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Antimima subtruncata is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and is often found in open habitats like grasslands and coastal dunes."
