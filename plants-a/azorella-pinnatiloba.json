    "intro": "Azorella pinnatiloba, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing cushions of foliage that help it survive in harsh, alpine environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. Azorella pinnatiloba is adapted to cold, arid conditions and can tolerate strong winds and intense sunlight. Its unique structure allows it to conserve moisture and withstand extreme temperature fluctuations."
