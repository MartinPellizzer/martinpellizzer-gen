    "intro": "Astragalus torrentum var. ciliatus, commonly known as the ciliate milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender stems and compound leaves with finely toothed margins. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers arranged in racemes, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
