It features compound leaves that are finely divided, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters, which are followed by spherical, red berries. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its graceful form and seasonal foliage changes."
