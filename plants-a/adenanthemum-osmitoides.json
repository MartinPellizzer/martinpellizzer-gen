    "intro": "Adenanthemum osmitoides, commonly known as the silver leaf adenanthemum, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery or white coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal watering, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers.",
