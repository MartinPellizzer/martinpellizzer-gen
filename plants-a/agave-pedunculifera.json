It features a short, thick stem with a rosette of gray-green, spiny leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
