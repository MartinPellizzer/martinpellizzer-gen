It typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and saline conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in dune environments and plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in arid and coastal regions."
