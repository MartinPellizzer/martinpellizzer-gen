    "intro": "Aparine verrucosa, commonly known as hairy cranesbill, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its upright stems and broad, lobed leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Aparine verrucosa is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it is known for its medicinal and ornamental uses."
