Its larvae are known to feed on the roots of plants, potentially causing damage to crops. The adult beetle is characterized by its dark, glossy body with a distinct pattern of pale markings. It is often found in agricultural areas where its host plants are cultivated. The plant's botanical features are closely tied to its role as a host for the beetle's life cycle."
