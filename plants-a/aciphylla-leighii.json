    "intro": "Aciphylla leighii, commonly known as the Leigh's tussock grass, is a perennial herb native to New Zealand. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit with short, stiff leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal and alpine regions, where it forms low, compact clumps. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, which help to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Aciphylla leighii is an important component of New Zealand's native vegetation, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various invertebrates.",
