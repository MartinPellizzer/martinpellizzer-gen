It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are typically deep green with a glossy texture. The plant produces an inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe, which can range from white to red or orange. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Anthurium curvispadix is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
