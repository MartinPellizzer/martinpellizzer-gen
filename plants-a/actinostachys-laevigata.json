    "intro": "Actinostachys laevigata, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed clubmoss, is a species of fern ally native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, evergreen stems that are covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporangia in clusters called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are simple and linear, often arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Actinostachys laevigata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.",
