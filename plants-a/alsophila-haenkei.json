    "intro": "Alsophila haenkei, commonly known as the Hainan tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to southern China and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive root system that helps it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, which are released into the air for dispersal. Alsophila haenkei is often found in tropical and subtropical forests, where it plays a role in maintaining soil stability and supporting biodiversity."
