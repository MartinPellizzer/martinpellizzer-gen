    "intro": "Amoria bivonae, commonly known as the Bivona orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and vibrant coloration. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are small but striking, featuring intricate patterns and a distinctive scent that attracts pollinators like bees and moths. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Amoria bivonae is considered critically endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
