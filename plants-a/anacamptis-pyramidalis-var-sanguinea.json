    "intro": "Anacamptis pyramidalis var. sanguinea, commonly known as the Blood-red Orchid, is a striking orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and a cluster of showy, red to orange-red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers have a distinctive structure with a spurred lip and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color."
