    "intro": "Aster pusillus, commonly known as the dwarf aster, is a small flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of only a few inches, featuring delicate blue to purple flowers that bloom in the late summer and early fall. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with composite flower heads. Due to its small size and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its subtle beauty."
