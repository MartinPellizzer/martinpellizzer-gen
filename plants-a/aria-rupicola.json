    "intro": "Aria rupicola, commonly known as the rock lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in dry, sunny environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. Aria rupicola is adapted to harsh conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its botanical characteristics make it an attractive addition to rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
