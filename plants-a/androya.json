These plants are native to various regions in Africa, Asia, and Australia, often growing in tropical and subtropical climates. Androya species typically feature showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are usually opposite and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface, while the stems are often woody and branched. Some species of Androya are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
