    "intro": "Atriplex transsilvanica, commonly known as Transylvanian saltbush, is a shrub native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a whitish powder, a feature known as a bloom, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to poor, saline soils. Atriplex transsilvanica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
