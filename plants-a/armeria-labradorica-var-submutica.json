It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variety is well adapted to harsh, cold environments and is often found in rocky or coastal areas."
