    "intro": "Alliaria arborescens, commonly known as tree garlic, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in racemes, and its leaves are typically oval with a slightly hairy texture. It is often found growing in moist, shaded areas such as woodland edges and stream banks. The plant is notable for its strong garlic-like odor, which is released when the leaves are crushed."
