    "intro": "Arabis arenosa var. brevisiliqua, commonly known as the sand arabis, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
