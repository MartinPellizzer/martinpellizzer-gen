    "intro": "Acreugenia pungens, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its spiny, paddle-shaped stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by edible fruits known as tunas. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system to access underground water. Acreugenia pungens is often used in traditional medicine and is also cultivated for ornamental purposes.",
