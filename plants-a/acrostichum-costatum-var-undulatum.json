The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its leaves are compound, with a serrated or toothed margin, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.",
