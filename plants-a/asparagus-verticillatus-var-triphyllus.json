    "intro": "Asparagus verticillatus var. triphyllus, commonly known as the three-leaf asparagus, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that often form a rosette. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that give way to red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental foliage and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance gardens."
