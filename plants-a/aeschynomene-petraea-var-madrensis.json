    "intro": "Aeschynomene petraea var. madrensis, commonly known as the Madren's rock aeschynomene, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and clusters of pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to thrive in poor, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
