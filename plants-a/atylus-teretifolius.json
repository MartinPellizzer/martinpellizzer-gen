    "intro": "Atylus teretifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Atylus teretifolius is known for its hard, dense wood, which is highly valued for construction and tool-making. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas."
