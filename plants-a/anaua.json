    "intro": "Anaua, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its strength and aesthetic appeal. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by pods containing flat, bean-like seeds. Anaua thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species, prompting conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat."
