    "intro": "Avenula arundana, commonly known as the meadow grass or meadow oatgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks, thriving in well-drained to slightly wet soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences with wind-pollinated flowers. Avenula arundana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity. It is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
