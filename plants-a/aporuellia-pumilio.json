    "intro": "Aporuellia pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf aporuellia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to certain regions of South America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in shades of white or pale green, and bloom during the spring and early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
