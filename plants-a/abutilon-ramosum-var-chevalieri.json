    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon ramosum var. chevalieri is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It is commonly found in countries such as Spain, Portugal, Morocco, Algeria, and Turkey. This plant thrives in coastal areas and rocky soils, often growing in dry, sunny environments. It is well adapted to the climate of the Mediterranean Basin, where it is part of the local flora. Its distribution is closely tied to the natural habitats of the region, making it a characteristic plant of the area.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon ramosum var. chevalieri was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast. It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive fuzzy leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields. It has since become naturalized in some regions, raising concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities. Despite its beauty, its introduction has led to discussions about ecological management and control."
