    "intro": "Antirrhinum orontium subvar. leiocarpum, commonly known as the smooth-seeded toadflax, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth texture. The plant produces vibrant yellow to orange flowers with two lips, typical of the Plantaginaceae family. Its flowers are tubular with a distinctive two-lipped structure, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. This subvariety is distinguished by its smooth, hairless seed capsules, which set it apart from other related species."
