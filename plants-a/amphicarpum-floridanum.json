    "intro": "Amphicarpum floridanum, commonly known as Florida false brome, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its ability to produce two types of fruits: one above ground and one below ground, a unique trait known as amphicarpism. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as prairies and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This species plays an important role in maintaining ecological balance in its native wetland environments."
