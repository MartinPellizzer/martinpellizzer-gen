It features a rhizomatous growth habit and produces elegant, bipinnate leaves that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium dubium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various garden conditions."
