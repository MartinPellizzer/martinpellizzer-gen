    "intro": "Apera spica-venti f. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf windgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, tufted stems that are typically less than 10 cm in height, making it a compact and delicate plant. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and the plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its small size and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
