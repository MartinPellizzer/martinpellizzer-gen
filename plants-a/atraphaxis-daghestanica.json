It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and narrow, gray-green leaves with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open landscapes. Atraphaxis daghestanica is adapted to withstand drought and temperature extremes, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
