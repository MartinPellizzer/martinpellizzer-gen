    "intro": "Alisma gramineum var. geyeri, commonly known as the Geyer's water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette, and it produces small, white or greenish flowers clustered in spikes. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported diuretic properties. The species is characterized by its ability to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
