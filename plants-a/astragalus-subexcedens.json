It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often covered with fine hairs. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that are arranged alternately along the stem. The flowers are yellow or greenish-yellow, clustered in dense, globular heads, and are adapted for pollination by insects."
