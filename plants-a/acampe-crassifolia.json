    "intro": "Acampe crassifolia, commonly known as the thick-leaved acampe, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, fleshy leaves that are adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its stems are woody and often branched, providing structural support in its harsh habitat. Acampe crassifolia is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acampe crassifolia is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is commonly found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It is typically found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Its distribution is closely associated with areas that have low rainfall and high temperatures.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acampe crassifolia was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and abandoned fields. It is commonly found in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and mild, wet winters. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen in coastal and inland areas. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions outside its native range. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can sometimes become invasive in non-native environments."
