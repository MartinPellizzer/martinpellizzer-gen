    "intro": "Antrophyopsis, commonly known as the candleplant, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Cactaceae. It is native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in countries like Argentina and Chile. The plant is characterized by its unique, candle-like stems that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, appearing in shades of yellow or orange. Antrophyopsis species are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making them an important part of the local flora in their native habitats."
