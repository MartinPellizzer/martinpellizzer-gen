    "intro": "Azorella cladorrhiza, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a unique evergreen shrub native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing cushions of foliage that form a compact, mat-like structure. The plant is well adapted to harsh alpine environments, with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Azorella cladorrhiza plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
