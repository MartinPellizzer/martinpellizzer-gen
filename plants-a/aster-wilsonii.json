    "intro": "Aster wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's aster, is a flowering plant native to the United States, particularly in the southeastern region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands, and it thrives in partial to full sunlight. Its showy blue to purple flowers bloom in the fall, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, Aster wilsonii is considered a rare and endangered species, prompting conservation efforts to protect its dwindling populations."
