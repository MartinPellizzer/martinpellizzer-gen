    "intro": "Armeria canescens var. dalmatica, commonly known as the Dalmatian thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in mild climates."
