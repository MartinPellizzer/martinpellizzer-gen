    "intro": "Aphelandra phlogea, commonly known as the golden torch plant, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that resemble torches, with vibrant yellow bracts. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are often overlooked beneath the showy bracts. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aphelandra phlogea is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its ornamental foliage and unique flowering display."
