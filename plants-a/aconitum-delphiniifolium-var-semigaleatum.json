    "intro": "Aconitum delphiniifolium var. semigaleatum, commonly known as the semi-galeate delphinium aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant features large, palmately compound leaves with a distinctive lobed structure, and its flowers are blue to purple, arranged in dense, spikelike clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for use in edible landscapes.",
