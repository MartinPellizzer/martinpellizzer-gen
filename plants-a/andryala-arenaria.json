    "intro": "Andryala arenaria, commonly known as sand sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. Its botanical structure is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and strong winds."
