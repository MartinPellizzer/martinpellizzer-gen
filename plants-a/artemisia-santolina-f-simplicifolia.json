It features silvery-gray foliage with a strong, aromatic scent, and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in summer. The plant is characterized by its finely divided leaves and dense, compact growth habit. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract beneficial insects."
