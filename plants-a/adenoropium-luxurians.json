    "intro": "Adenoropium luxurians, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by oval, woody fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas.",
