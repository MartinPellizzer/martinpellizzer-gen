    "intro": "Athyrium acutissimum, commonly known as the narrowleaf Japanese shield fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant features a slender, wiry rhizome and produces small, clustered spore cases on the underside of its fronds. Native to East Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for shady gardens and rockeries."
