    "intro": "Apium inundatum var. terrestre, commonly known as the terrestrial parsley watercress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic stems and finely divided, feather-like leaves that resemble those of parsley. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in wet, marshy environments and is often found in temperate regions. Due to its preference for moist habitats, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting aquatic ecosystems."
