    "intro": "Aconitum napellus var. tauricum, commonly known as the Taurian monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features striking blue-violet flowers arranged in a spire-like inflorescence, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has palmately divided, deeply lobed leaves that are dark green and hairy. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens.",
