    "intro": "Arenaria armerina subsp. frigida, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, helping it retain moisture in harsh conditions. This subspecies is often found in open habitats such as grasslands, meadows, and scree slopes."
