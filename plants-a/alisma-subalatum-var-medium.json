    "intro": "Alisma subalatum var. medium, commonly known as the alpine water plant, is a variant of the water plantain that thrives in moist, often alpine environments. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, typical of the Alismataceae family. It is often found in mountain streams, ponds, and wet meadows where it contributes to aquatic ecosystems. Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for water quality and ecological health."
