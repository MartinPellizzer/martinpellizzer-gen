It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, delicate leaves with a smooth, glabrous surface. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
