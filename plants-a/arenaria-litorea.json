    "intro": "Arenaria litorea, commonly known as beach sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to coastal regions. It thrives in sandy and rocky shores, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically succulent, helping it retain moisture in harsh environments. Arenaria litorea plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
