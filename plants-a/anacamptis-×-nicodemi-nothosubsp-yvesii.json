    "intro": "Anacamptis \u00d7 nicodemi nothosubsp. yvesii, commonly known as the Yves' hybrid orchid, is a rare and naturally occurring hybrid within the Orchidaceae family. It exhibits a combination of morphological traits from its parent species, Anacamptis morio and Anacamptis pyramidalis, resulting in unique floral characteristics. The plant typically produces tall, erect stems with showy, spurred flowers in shades of purple and white. It thrives in open, sunny habitats with well-drained soil, often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
