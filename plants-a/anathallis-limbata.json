    "intro": "Anathallis limbata, commonly known as the yellow star orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a star-like pattern, which are often adorned with purple or brown markings. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its morphology includes thin, wiry stems and lance-shaped leaves that help it conserve moisture. Anathallis limbata is a epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic, and it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
