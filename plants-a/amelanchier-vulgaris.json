    "intro": "Amelanchier vulgaris, commonly known as common serviceberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible berries that ripen in late summer, turning from red to dark purple. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, turning yellow in autumn. Amelanchier vulgaris is often found in woodland edges and moist soils, and it serves as a valuable food source for birds and wildlife."
