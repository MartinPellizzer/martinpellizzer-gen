    "intro": "Aristida mutabilis, commonly known as the variable grass or silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and tufted growth habit, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often pale green to brown in color. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
