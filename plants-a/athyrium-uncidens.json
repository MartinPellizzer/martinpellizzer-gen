    "intro": "Athyrium uncidens, commonly known as the fern with curled fronds, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often curl or twist, giving it a distinctive appearance. Native to Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are typically short and creeping, supporting the growth of its erect, lance-shaped fronds. The plant's reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
