    "intro": "Astragalus lineatus, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces cylindrical seedpods that contain numerous tiny, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Astragalus lineatus plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
