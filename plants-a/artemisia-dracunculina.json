    "intro": "Artemisia dracunculina, commonly known as sweet wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish flowers. The plant contains volatile oils, particularly camphor and thujone, which contribute to its strong scent and medicinal properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or arid environments. Due to its chemical composition, it has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a source of ingredients for pharmaceuticals."
