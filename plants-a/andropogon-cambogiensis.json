    "intro": "Andropogon cambogiensis, commonly known as Cambogia grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems."
