    "intro": "Athyrium thelypteris, commonly known as the common lady fern, is a species of fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. The botanical features of Athyrium thelypteris make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
