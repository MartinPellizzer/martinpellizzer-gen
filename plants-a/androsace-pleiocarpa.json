    "intro": "Androsace pleiocarpa, commonly known as the many-fruited rock-cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces multiple fruits, each containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Androsace pleiocarpa thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. It is often found in high-altitude meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
