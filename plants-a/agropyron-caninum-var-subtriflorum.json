    "intro": "Agropyron caninum var. subtriflorum, commonly known as the three-flowered wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with three to five florets, giving it its common name. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in dry grasslands. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological restoration and erosion control."
