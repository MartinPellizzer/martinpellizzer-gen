    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelia graebneriana is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically in regions of Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, streambanks, and other shaded to partially sunny habitats. This plant is well adapted to the humid climate and is commonly found in the Appalachian region. It is also occasionally found in parts of Tennessee and Florida. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated outside its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia graebneriana was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its attractive pink and white flowers and compact growth habit. It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas, particularly in the eastern and central United States. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for shrub borders and foundation plantings. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists about its potential impact on local ecosystems."
