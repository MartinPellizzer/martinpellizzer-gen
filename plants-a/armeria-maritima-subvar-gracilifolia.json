    "intro": "Armeria maritima subvar. gracilifolia, commonly known as the slender-leaved thrift, is a perennial plant native to coastal regions of the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand salty air and coastal winds. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for coastal gardens. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
