    "intro": "Acisanthera tetramera, commonly known as the four-petaled sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, four-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to survive in dry, hot environments. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are arranged oppositely along the stems, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Acisanthera tetramera is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an indicator species of arid and semi-arid habitats.",
