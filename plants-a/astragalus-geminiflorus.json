    "intro": "Astragalus geminiflorus, commonly known as the twin-flower milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility. Astragalus geminiflorus is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
