    "intro": "Alchemilla sinuata, commonly known as the zigzag plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, arranged in branched clusters. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla sinuata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet habitats."
