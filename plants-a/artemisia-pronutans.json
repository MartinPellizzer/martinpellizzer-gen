    "intro": "Artemisia pronutans, commonly known as silver sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, fuzzy hairs that reflect light and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in dense, spherical shapes. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in open plains and rocky soils. Artemisia pronutans is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
