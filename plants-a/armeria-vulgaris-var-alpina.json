It features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
