    "intro": "Alchemilla oleosa, commonly known as the yellow lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, hairy leaves that are often tinged with yellow or rust-colored veins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla oleosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in herbal medicine."
