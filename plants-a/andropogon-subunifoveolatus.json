    "intro": "Andropogon subunifoveolatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland and marshy habitats, where it forms dense clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes are robust, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form extensive colonies. Andropogon subunifoveolatus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
