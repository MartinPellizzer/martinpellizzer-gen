    "intro": "Aleuritopteris likiangensis, commonly known as the Likiang water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to China. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically submerged or floating in water. The plant has a complex rhizome system that helps anchor it in aquatic environments. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds. Aleuritopteris likiangensis plays an important ecological role in freshwater ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
