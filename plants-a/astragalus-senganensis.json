    "intro": "Astragalus senganensis, commonly known as the Sengan milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Astragalus senganensis is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root system. This species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
