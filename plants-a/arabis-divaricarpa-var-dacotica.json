    "intro": "Arabis divaricarpa var. dacotica, commonly known as the Dakota rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the northern Great Plains of North America. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in prairie or steppe habitats. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
