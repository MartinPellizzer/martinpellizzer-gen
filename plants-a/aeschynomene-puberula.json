It is a small annual herb that typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant features slender, branched stems covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slightly pubescent surface. The flowers are small and clustered in racemes, with white or pale blue petals, and the plant produces small, three-lobed pods that contain several seeds."
