    "intro": "Aloe neglecta, commonly known as the desert aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, spiky leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and container planting. Aloe neglecta is also valued for its hardy nature and low maintenance requirements."
