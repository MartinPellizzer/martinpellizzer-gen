    "intro": "Astragalus bicolor subsp. karputanus, commonly known as the Karpu\u021ban milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula and parts of Anatolia. It typically grows in dry, rocky, or grassland habitats, often in regions with limited moisture. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow or pale yellow flowers arranged in spikes. Its root system is fibrous and can be quite deep, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
