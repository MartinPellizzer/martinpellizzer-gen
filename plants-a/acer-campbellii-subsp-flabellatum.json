    "intro": "Acer campbellii subsp. flabellatum, commonly known as the Campbell's maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. It is relatively slow-growing and tolerant of cold climates, making it suitable for temperate gardens. Its ornamental value is largely due to its distinctive foliage and autumn coloration.",

The plant is often associated with forested areas and rocky outcrops. Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of Southeast Asia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer campbellii subsp. flabellatum was mainly introduced to specific regions in the Pacific Northwest of the United States and parts of British Columbia, Canada. It was introduced primarily as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and aesthetic appeal. This subspecies is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its decorative value. However, it has also been reported to naturalize in some areas, raising concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems. Its introduction has led to increased interest in its ecological role and management in the wild."
