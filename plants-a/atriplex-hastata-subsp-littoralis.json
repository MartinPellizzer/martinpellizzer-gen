    "intro": "Atriplex hastata subsp. littoralis, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to coastal regions of western North America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in arid environments. The plant thrives in saline soils and is often found in dunes, salt marshes, and coastal plains. Its small greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, three-lobed seeds. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife."
