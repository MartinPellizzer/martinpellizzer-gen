    "intro": "Andromeda salicifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf andromeda, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in clusters, typically pink to reddish in color, which bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to moist, acidic soils. Andromeda salicifolia is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
