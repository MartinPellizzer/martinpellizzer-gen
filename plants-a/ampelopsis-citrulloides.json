    "intro": "Ampelopsis citrulloides, commonly known as the golden ivy, is a climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that turn vibrant yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its vigorous growth habit requires support structures, and it is often used in vertical gardens or as a ground cover."
