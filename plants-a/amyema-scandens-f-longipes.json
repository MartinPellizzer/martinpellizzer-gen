    "intro": "Amyema scandens f. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily eucalypts. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own sugars through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white, fleshy berries that are an important food source for native birds. Its growth habit is vine-like, allowing it to spread along the canopy of its host. This form of Amyema is particularly adapted to the humid, tropical conditions of northeastern Australia."
