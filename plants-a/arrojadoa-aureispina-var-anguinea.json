    "intro": "Arrojadoa aureispina var. anguinea, commonly known as the golden spiny arrojadoa, is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and spiny stems, which are adaptations to its humid, tropical environment. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture, and its flowers are typically clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in secondary vegetation. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
