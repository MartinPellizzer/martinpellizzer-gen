    "intro": "Artanthe tuberculata var. brevispicata, commonly known as the narrow-papillate artanthe, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and showy blooms. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its compact, mat-forming growth habit. Its leaves are covered in small, raised bumps called papillae, which give it its specific epithet \"tuberculata.\" The variety brevispicata is distinguished by its shorter, more compact inflorescences compared to other varieties of the species."
