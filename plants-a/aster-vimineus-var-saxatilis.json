    "intro": "Aster vimineus var. saxatilis, commonly known as the saxatile willow-aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features slender, wiry stems that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, willow-like appearance. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough texture and a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white to purple. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting pollinators in its native environment."
