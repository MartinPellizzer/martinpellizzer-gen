It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features compound leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces small, yellow to green flowers in late spring. Its seed pods are cylindrical and contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. Astragalus cinereus is often found in open habitats such as grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and disturbed areas."
