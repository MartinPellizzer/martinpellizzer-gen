    "intro": "Aralia thomsonii var. integerrima, commonly known as the Pacific yew, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged and have a soft, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest environments. Due to its historical use in the production of the chemotherapy drug paclitaxel, it has also been the subject of conservation efforts."
