    "intro": "Asplenium goetzii, commonly known as the Goetz's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. Asplenium goetzii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
