    "intro": "Aulacophyllum skinneri, commonly known as the Skinner's rockcap, is a species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and dark green, leathery leaves that are often curved and overlapping. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or stream banks. Its sporophytes are relatively short, with a distinctive, elongated seta and a capsule that is often covered in a thick, waxy cuticle. Aulacophyllum skinneri is a cryptogamic plant that plays a role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its habitat."
