    "intro": "Acer palmatum var. spontaneum, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its finely dissected, palmate leaves that display a range of colors from bright green to red and orange, especially in autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters and has a rounded, compact form. It prefers partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its seasonal foliage changes and delicate, inconspicuous flowers that appear in early spring.",
