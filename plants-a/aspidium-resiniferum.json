    "intro": "Aspidium resiniferum, commonly known as the resinous water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a fine, resinous coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of its fronds. Aspidium resiniferum is known for its ability to thrive in humid climates and its unique botanical features make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
