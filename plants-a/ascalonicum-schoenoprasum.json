    "intro": "Ascalonicum schoenoprasum, commonly known as garden sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It features slender, upright stems that are often reddish in color and bear alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shady environments. Garden sorrel is known for its tangy, sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid in its leaves."
