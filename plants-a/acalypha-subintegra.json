    "intro": "Acalypha subintegra, commonly known as the velvetleaf or silky leaf plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its striking, velvety foliage that ranges from green to reddish hues. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. It thrives in humid environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Acalypha subintegra is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive leaves and ease of care.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha subintegra is primarily native to New Guinea. It is found in the tropical regions of this island, where it thrives in humid and warm climates. The plant is commonly found in lowland areas and near water sources. It is often seen growing in disturbed soils and along forest edges. Its native distribution is largely confined to the eastern and western parts of New Guinea.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha subintegra was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was likely brought there during the 19th or early 20th century by horticulturists and gardeners seeking exotic plants for cultivation. The species has since become naturalized in some areas, spreading through both seed dispersal and vegetative reproduction. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and vacant lots. However, its invasive potential remains a concern in some regions where it can outcompete native vegetation."
