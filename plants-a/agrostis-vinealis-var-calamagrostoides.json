    "intro": "Agrostis vinealis var. calamagrostoides, commonly known as the coastal meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal areas of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. This variety is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is frequently found in dunes, salt marshes, and coastal meadows. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for various small organisms. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal in landscaping due to its delicate appearance and hardiness."
