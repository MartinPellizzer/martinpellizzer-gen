    "intro": "Arenaria patula, commonly known as sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along paths. Its ability to spread via runners makes it an effective ground cover in arid landscapes."
