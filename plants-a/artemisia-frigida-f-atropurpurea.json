    "intro": "Artemisia frigida f. atropurpurea, commonly known as purplestem wormwood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray, aromatic foliage and stems that turn a striking purple hue in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in panicles, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. Its medicinal properties and historical use by indigenous peoples contribute to its significance in both ecological and cultural contexts."
