    "intro": "Antidesma bunius var. thwaitesianum, commonly known as the African starfruit or thwaitesianum starfruit, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by fleshy, star-shaped berries that are edible. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. The berries are rich in nutrients and are used both for food and traditional medicine in some regions."
