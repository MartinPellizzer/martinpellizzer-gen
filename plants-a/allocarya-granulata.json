    "intro": "Allocarya granulata, commonly known as the granulate lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a thin, tightly adherent layer on rock surfaces. The thallus is typically pale to dark yellowish in color, with a granular texture that gives it its common name. It is often found in shaded, humid environments, such as forest floors or on tree bark. This lichen is known for its ability to tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions, making it a common sight in temperate regions."
