    "intro": "Amadea diffusa, commonly known as the Florida panhandle lily, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, white to pale pink flowers with a distinctive, fragrant scent. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as swamps and pine flatwoods. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its persistence in wetland habitats. Amadea diffusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
