    "intro": "Adiantopsis obtusissima, commonly known as the broad-leaved maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate leaves that are often dark green and have a glossy appearance. The fronds are typically upright and can reach lengths of up to 30 inches, with each leaflet being small and closely spaced. This plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.",
