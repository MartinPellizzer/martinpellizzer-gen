    "intro": "Allocasuarina muelleriana, commonly known as the narrow-leaf she-oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its unique cylindrical, needle-like leaves that are clustered at the base of the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically arranged in spikes, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of southern and western Australia. Allocasuarina muelleriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature."
