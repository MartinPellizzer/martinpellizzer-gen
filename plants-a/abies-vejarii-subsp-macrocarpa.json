    "intro": "Abies vejarii subsp. macrocarpa, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada fir, is a coniferous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the shoots. The tree produces cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of conifers. Its bark is typically smooth and grayish, becoming furrowed with age. This subspecies is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in mixed coniferous forests.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies vejarii subsp. macrocarpa is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It is found in the Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges, growing at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. This subspecies thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils, often in mixed coniferous forests. It is commonly associated with other high-elevation tree species such as Douglas fir and white fir. Due to its limited range, it is considered a relatively rare and localized species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies vejarii subsp. macrocarpa was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates characterized by moist, well-drained soils and moderate temperatures. It thrives in areas with high humidity and is often found in mountainous or high-altitude environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities, including its dense foliage and attractive cone structure. It has been planted in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide year-round interest. However, its introduction can sometimes lead to ecological impacts in non-native habitats."
