    "intro": "Aralia decomposita, commonly known as the white wood fern, is a deciduous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, feathery fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces spore-bearing clusters called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Aralia decomposita is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
