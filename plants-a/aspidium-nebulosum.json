    "intro": "Aspidium nebulosum, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that often appear in a cloud-like pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium nebulosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
