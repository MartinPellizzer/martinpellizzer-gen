    "intro": "Artemisia triniana, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of small, aromatic, and often fuzzy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Artemisia triniana contains volatile oils and is known for its strong, bitter aroma. It has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its purported antiparasitic and digestive properties."
