    "intro": "Amygdalus persica var. potaninii, commonly known as the Persian almond, is a variant of the peach tree that exhibits distinct botanical characteristics. It is native to regions of Central Asia and is recognized for its smaller, more oval-shaped fruits compared to typical peaches. The plant produces flowers with white petals and yellow stamens, typical of the Prunus genus. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a serrated margin. The fruit, while edible, is often less sweet and more tart than standard peaches, making it a unique cultivar in botanical studies."
