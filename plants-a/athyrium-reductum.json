    "intro": "Athyrium reductum, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds in clusters called sori. Athyrium reductum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
