    "intro": "Avenula marginata subsp. pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands and forest margins. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in cool, temperate climates and is adapted to rocky or disturbed habitats. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and locally endemic species."
