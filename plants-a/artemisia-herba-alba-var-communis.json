    "intro": "Artemisia herba-alba var. communis, commonly known as white sage, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its aromatic properties are due to the presence of volatile oils, including thujone and camphor."
