It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with hairy, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
