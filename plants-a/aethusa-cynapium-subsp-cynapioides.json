    "intro": "Aethusa cynapium subsp. cynapioides, commonly known as the broadleaf cowbane, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic compounds. The plant has smooth, hollow stems and broad, pinnately compound leaves with a distinctive bitter taste. It produces small, white to greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Due to its toxic properties, it is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
