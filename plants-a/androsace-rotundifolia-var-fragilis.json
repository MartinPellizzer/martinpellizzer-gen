    "intro": "Androsace rotundifolia var. fragilis, commonly known as the fragrant cushion sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has rounded, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, aiding in water retention. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its delicate appearance and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions make it a notable species in its native ecosystems."
