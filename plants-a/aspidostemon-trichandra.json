It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside its native range."
