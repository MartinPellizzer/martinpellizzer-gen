    "intro": "Arkezostis tayuya, commonly known as the Tayuya orchid, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking violet and white petals. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and requires cool, moist environments to thrive. Its flowers bloom in late spring, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Arkezostis tayuya is considered a vulnerable species."
