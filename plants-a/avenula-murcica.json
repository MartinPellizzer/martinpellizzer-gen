    "intro": "Avenula murcica, commonly known as the Murcian oatgrass, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring. It is valued for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Avenula murcica plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is not widely cultivated for agricultural purposes."
