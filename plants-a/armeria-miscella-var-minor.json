    "intro": "Armeria miscella var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf sea thrift, is a low-growing flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It features dense clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its often salty, windy habitat. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along rocky shores. Its compact form and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscaping."
