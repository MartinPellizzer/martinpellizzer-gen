    "intro": "Allium tricorne, commonly known as the three-lobed garlic, is a bulbous plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, triangular-shaped bulb and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces umbels of white or pale pink flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs are edible, though they are less commonly used in cooking compared to other Allium species. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and aromatic qualities."
