It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with thread-like leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and mountainous regions. Astragalus cedreticola plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
