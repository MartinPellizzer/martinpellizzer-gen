    "intro": "Androcalva microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in tight inflorescences, often blooming in late spring or early summer. Its adaptations to arid environments include deep root systems and a high tolerance for drought and poor soil conditions. Androcalva microphylla is often used in local landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal in dry gardens."
