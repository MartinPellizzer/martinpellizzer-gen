    "intro": "Athyrium taiwanense var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy male fern, is a variant of the male fern native to Taiwan. It is a fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae, characterized by its fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that are often clustered along the rachis. The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
