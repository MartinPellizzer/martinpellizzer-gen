    "intro": "Aizoon sericeum, commonly known as silky aizoon, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in spring. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. Aizoon sericeum is often found in rocky soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
