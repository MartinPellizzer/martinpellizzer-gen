    "intro": "Aspidium triangulum subsp. caudatum, commonly known as the long-tailed water fern, is a member of the fern family Polypodiaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit with fronds that are triangular in shape and often have a distinctive elongated base. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns. This subspecies is noted for its adaptability to wet conditions and its role in aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
