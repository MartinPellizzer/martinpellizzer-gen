    "intro": "Allium therinanthum, commonly known as the Persian leek, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces umbels of pale to deep purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, onion-like flavor, often used in traditional cuisines. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
