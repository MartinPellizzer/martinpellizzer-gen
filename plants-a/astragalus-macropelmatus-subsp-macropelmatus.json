    "intro": "Astragalus macropelmatus subsp. macropelmatus, commonly known as the large-peltate milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and pinnately compound leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in umbels, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in dry, sandy soils. This subspecies is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert grassland habitats."
