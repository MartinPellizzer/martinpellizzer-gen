    "intro": "Acrostichum macrorhizum, commonly known as the broadroot fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its large, broad, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system, which allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. This fern is often found in wetlands and along stream banks in its native range.",
