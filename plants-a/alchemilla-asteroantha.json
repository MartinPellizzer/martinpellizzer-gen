It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has basal leaves that are hairy and somewhat succulent, adapted to its native arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its prolonged flowering period and low maintenance requirements."
