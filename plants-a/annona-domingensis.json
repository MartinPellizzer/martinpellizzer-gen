It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, with a dense, spreading canopy. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy on top. Its flowers are yellow with a red center, and it bears fruit that is typically green when unripe and turns yellow or orange when mature. The fruit has a thick, fibrous skin and a sweet, creamy pulp with a distinctive aroma."
