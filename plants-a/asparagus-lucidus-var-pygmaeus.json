    "intro": "Asparagus lucidus var. pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf asparagus, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features slender, arching stems that produce small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers. The plant's leaves are narrow and grass-like, typical of the Asparagaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
