This subspecies typically grows in coastal and inland areas, often in rocky or gravelly soils. It is commonly associated with coastal dunes and heathlands. The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate and can tolerate salt spray in coastal regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena sanguisorbae subsp. epoligotricha was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. This subspecies is commonly found in disturbed soils and open habitats. It has become naturalized in various regions of the country. However, it is not considered a major invasive species in New Zealand."
