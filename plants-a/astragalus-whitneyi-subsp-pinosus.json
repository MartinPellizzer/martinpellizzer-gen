It typically grows in rocky, dry habitats such as mountain slopes and open woodlands. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces yellow flowers in early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
