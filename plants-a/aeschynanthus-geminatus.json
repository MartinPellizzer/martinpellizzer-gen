It is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant, tubular flowers. The plant produces showy, red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a glossy surface, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Aeschynanthus geminatus is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
