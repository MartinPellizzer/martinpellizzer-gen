    "intro": "Armeria ebracteata, commonly known as the leafless thrift, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. It has no leaves along the flowering stems, giving it its common name. Armeria ebracteata is often used in coastal gardens for its hardiness and ornamental value."
