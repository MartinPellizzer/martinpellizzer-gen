    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris subvar. vegeta, commonly known as the velvet cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a dense mat of soft, hairy foliage that gives it a velvety texture, and it produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in early summer. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and damp grasslands. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for both ecological and ornamental purposes."
