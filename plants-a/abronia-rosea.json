    "intro": "Abronia rosea, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves and thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. It is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and frequent wind. Abronia rosea plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native insects.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abronia rosea is primarily native to the coastal areas of California and Baja California, Mexico. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. This plant is commonly found in dune environments and is well adapted to the harsh coastal conditions. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and sensitive species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abronia rosea was mainly introduced to coastal dune environments where it thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. It is often found in areas with moderate salt exposure and full sun, making it a common sight along shorelines. This plant plays a vital role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion. Its introduction has helped restore degraded coastal habitats in several regions. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological imbalances."
