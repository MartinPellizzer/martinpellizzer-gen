    "intro": "Anthospermum aethiopicum var. papillatum, commonly known as the African snowflake, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, giving it a snow-like appearance. The plant typically grows in grasslands and open woodlands, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine, papillate (bump-like) structures, which contribute to its scientific name. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
