    "intro": "Acer macrophyllum var. normalis, commonly known as the Oregon maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and forest understories. The Oregon maple is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.",
