    "intro": "Asplenium adiantum-nigrum var. gaudichaudii, commonly known as the black spleenwort, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that often have a slightly glossy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in humid indoor settings."
