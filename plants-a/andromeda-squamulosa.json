    "intro": "Andromeda squamulosa, commonly known as the dwarf alder, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are densely covered with short, scale-like hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink in color, followed by cone-like fruits. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its botanical features make it an important component of coastal and alpine ecosystems."
