    "intro": "Aspidium rigidum var. germanicum, commonly known as the German shield fern, is a perennial fern native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its robust, upright fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. The varietal form, germanicum, is distinguished by its slightly different leaf shape and size compared to the typical variety of Aspidium rigidum."
