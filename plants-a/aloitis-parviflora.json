    "intro": "Aloitis parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered aloes, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Aloe genus and is characterized by its fleshy, spiny leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months, typically in summer. It prefers well-draining soil and full sun exposure, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance gardening."
