It features striking, spurred flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in early to mid-summer. The plant has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, silvery hairs. It thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique floral structure and long blooming period."
