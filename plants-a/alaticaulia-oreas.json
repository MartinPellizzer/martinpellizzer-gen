    "intro": "Alaticaulia oreas, commonly known as the mountain alateleaf, is a rare and unique plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its distinctive, winged leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid mountain environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Its growth habit is shrub-like, with multiple stems that often grow close to the ground. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Alaticaulia oreas is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
