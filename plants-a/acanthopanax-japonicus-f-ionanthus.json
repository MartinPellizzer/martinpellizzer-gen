    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthopanax japonicus f. ionanthus is primarily native to the Korean Peninsula, including both North and South Korea. This plant is also found in parts of eastern China, particularly in the provinces of Liaoning and Jilin. It thrives in temperate forest environments, often growing in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. The species is commonly associated with mixed deciduous and evergreen forests. Its native distribution is limited to these specific geographic areas, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopanax japonicus f. ionanthus was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates that provide suitable growing conditions for its growth. It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. This plant has been introduced to parts of North America and Europe as an ornamental species due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It thrives in USDA hardiness zones 5 through 8, making it adaptable to a variety of garden environments. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native regions."
