    "intro": "Amyris centinelensis, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-brown heartwood that is highly valued for its durability and fragrance. The plant has simple, opposite, and lance-shaped leaves, and its flowers are typically yellow or white, arranged in clusters. Amyris centinelensis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry forest or scrub habitats. Due to overharvesting, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
