    "intro": "Acrostichum squamatum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a unique fern species native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds that are covered in fine, scale-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sporangia, are typically located on the underside of its fronds. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is not commonly cultivated due to its specific habitat requirements.",
