    "intro": "Apium nodiflorum subsp. repens, commonly known as creeping cow parsley, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, with a mild parsley-like scent. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks."
