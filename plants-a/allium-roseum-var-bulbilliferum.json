    "intro": "Allium roseum var. bulbilliferum, commonly known as the pink onion or rose garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its small, spherical bulbs that form along the stem, a trait reflected in its varietal name \"bulbilliferum.\" It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and mild garlic scent."
