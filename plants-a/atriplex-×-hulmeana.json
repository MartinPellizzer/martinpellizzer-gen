It is a natural hybrid between Atriplex nummularia and Atriplex lentifolia, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant is adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable species for rehabilitation of degraded lands. Its leaves are small, succulent, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Atriplex \u00d7 hulmeana plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
