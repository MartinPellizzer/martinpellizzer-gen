    "intro": "Allionia guasapoides, commonly known as the Guasapoides lily, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Allionia guasapoides is considered a species of conservation concern."
