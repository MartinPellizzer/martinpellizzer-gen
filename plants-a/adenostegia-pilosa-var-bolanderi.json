    "intro": "Adenostegia pilosa var. bolanderi, commonly known as Bolander's hairy adenostegia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of California. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral habitats. Its morphology includes wiry stems and small, lance-shaped leaves covered in fine pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.",
