It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, compound leaves and pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces small, dry fruits called legumes, which contain several seeds. Astragalus pseudohumilis is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations."
