    "intro": "Alsine tenuifolia var. mucronata, commonly known as narrowleaf alsike clover, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, linear leaves and small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration. It is also used in forage and as a green manure crop due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities."
