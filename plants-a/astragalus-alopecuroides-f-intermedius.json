    "intro": "Astragalus alopecuroides f. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in racemes. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is native to regions of central Asia, including parts of China and Mongolia. Its leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This subspecies is often found in steppe and semi-desert habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
