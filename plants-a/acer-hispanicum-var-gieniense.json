    "intro": "Acer hispanicum var. gieniense, commonly known as the Gienese maple, is a rare and endemic species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras that contribute to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",
