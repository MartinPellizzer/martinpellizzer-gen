    "intro": "Arenaria canescens, commonly known as sand pink, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Arenaria canescens is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal sands, making it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
