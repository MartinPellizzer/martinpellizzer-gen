    "intro": "Acetosa simpliciflora, commonly known as the simpleflower sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, with a distinctive sour taste due to its high content of oxalic acid. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Acetosa simpliciflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.",
