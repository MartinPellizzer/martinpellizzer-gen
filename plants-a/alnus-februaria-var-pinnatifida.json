    "intro": "Alnus februaria var. pinnatifida, commonly known as the slender alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely pinnately lobed leaves, which give it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks. This species is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
