    "intro": "Arthrolepis, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of small, epiphytic or lithophytic ferns native to South America. These plants typically grow on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. They have delicate, often hairy leaves that are arranged in a compact rosette pattern. Arthrolepis species are characterized by their small, inconspicuous spore-producing structures called sori. Due to their specific habitat requirements, they are often found in tropical and subtropical regions with high moisture levels."
