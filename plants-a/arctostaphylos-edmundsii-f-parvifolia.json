    "intro": "Arctostaphylos edmundsii f. parvifolia, commonly known as the dwarf manzanita, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of California. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically gray-green in color and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds. This variety is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal chaparral habitats."
