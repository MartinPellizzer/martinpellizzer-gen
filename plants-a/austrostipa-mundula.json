    "intro": "Austrostipa mundula, commonly known as the slender wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, contributing to its drought tolerance. Austrostipa mundula plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small fauna in its native range."
