    "intro": "Andrachne schweinfurthii var. papillosa, commonly known as the woolly sandmat, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, white to pinkish flowers clustered in umbels. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral ecosystems. The varietal name \"papillosa\" refers to the woolly or fuzzy texture of its foliage."
