    "intro": "Adenostephanus nitidus, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its succulent-like leaves and stems store water, adapting it to drought conditions. Adenostephanus nitidus is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in full sun.",
