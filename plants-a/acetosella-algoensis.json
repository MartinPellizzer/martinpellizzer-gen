    "intro": "Acetosella algoensis, commonly known as the Andean spring beauty, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help to retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers typically bloom in early spring, and it is adapted to the cold, high-altitude environments where it thrives. Acetosella algoensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems.",
