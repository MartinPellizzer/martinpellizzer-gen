    "intro": "Athyrium longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed lady fern, is a species of fern native to the forests of East Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically arching and delicate in appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Athyrium longipes is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various garden conditions."
