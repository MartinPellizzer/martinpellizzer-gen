    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena glabra var. diandra is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the northern and central regions of the country, including the North Island and parts of the South Island. This variety thrives in a range of habitats, such as forest margins, shrublands, and rocky areas. It is commonly associated with coastal and lowland environments. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native range, supporting local wildlife and contributing to soil stability.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena glabra var. diandra was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the early European settlement and has since become naturalized in various regions. This plant is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, particularly in disturbed soils. It is often considered a weed due to its ability to spread rapidly and outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has had significant ecological impacts on local ecosystems."
