    "intro": "Anthoxanthum odoratum var. pilosum, commonly known as sweet vernal grass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems. It produces bright yellow to orange inflorescences, which are often described as having a sweet, honey-like scent, especially when crushed. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including North America. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as meadows and roadside verges. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
