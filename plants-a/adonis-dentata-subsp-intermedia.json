It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its basal leaves with serrated edges and clusters of bright yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance. However, it is considered toxic due to the presence of protoanemonin in its tissues.",
