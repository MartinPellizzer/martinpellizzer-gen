It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are followed by distinctive, velvety seed heads. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla hadacii is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
