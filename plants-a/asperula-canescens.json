    "intro": "Asperula canescens, commonly known as the silver weigela, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white during the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Asperula canescens is also valued for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
