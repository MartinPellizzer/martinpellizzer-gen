    "intro": "Antholyza huillensis, commonly known as the Huill\u00e9n's antholyza, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine areas. Its flowers are small and white or pale green, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Antholyza huillensis is considered a rare and endemic species."
