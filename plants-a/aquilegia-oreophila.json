    "intro": "Aquilegia oreophila, commonly known as the mountain columbine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its distinctive spurred petals and vibrant, often blue or purple, flower colors. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or alpine habitats. Its leaves are palmately divided, and it produces seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Aquilegia oreophila is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
