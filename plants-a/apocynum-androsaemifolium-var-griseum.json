    "intro": "Apocynum androsaemifolium var. griseum, commonly known as the grayleaf dogbane, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its gray-green, woolly foliage and clusters of small, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many milkweed species, and produces a milky sap that is toxic to some animals. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a rough texture, and the stems are upright and branching. This variant is distinguished by its pale, almost silvery appearance, which sets it apart from other varieties of dogbane."
