    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha alexandri is primarily native to the island of Madagascar. It is found in various habitats across the island, including dry forests and rocky outcrops. This species is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of Madagascar, which have led to its distinct evolutionary traits. It is part of the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its striking foliage. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha alexandri was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since become naturalized in several regions of the country. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and inland forested areas. Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to outcompete native species. Despite its aesthetic appeal, efforts are being made to control its distribution to prevent ecological harm."
