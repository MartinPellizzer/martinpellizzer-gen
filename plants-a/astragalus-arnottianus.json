    "intro": "Astragalus arnottianus, commonly known as Arnott's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to dry, harsh environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and animals. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some areas."
