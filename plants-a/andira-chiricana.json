    "intro": "Andira chiricana, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or false cherry, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a red, fleshy drupe that resembles a cherry, though it is not related to the true cherry species. Andira chiricana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
