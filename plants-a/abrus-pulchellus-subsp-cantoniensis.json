It is characterized by its striking clusters of red flowers that resemble coral, which bloom in spring. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces distinctive flat, bean-like pods that turn red as they mature. The seeds are encased in a hard, ornamental scarlet aril, which is often used in traditional crafts. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens.",
