    "intro": "Astragalus glabriusculus var. spatiosus, commonly known as the broad-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its glabrous (smooth) stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by indehiscent pods containing several elliptical seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
