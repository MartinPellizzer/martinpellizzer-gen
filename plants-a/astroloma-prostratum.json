    "intro": "Astroloma prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate astroloma, is a low-growing shrub native to Western Australia. It features small, waxy, blue or violet flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a mat-forming habit, with slender stems that spread along the ground. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils within coastal and inland regions."
