    "intro": "Aspidium dimorphum, commonly known as the two-form fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive dimorphic fronds, which consist of two different types of leaves: fertile and sterile. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fertile fronds. Aspidium dimorphum is found in various parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Southeast Asia."
