    "intro": "Allium gilgiticum, commonly known as the Gilgit garlic, is a bulbous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its elongated, cylindrical bulbs and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in mountainous regions at elevations above 2,500 meters. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical studies."
