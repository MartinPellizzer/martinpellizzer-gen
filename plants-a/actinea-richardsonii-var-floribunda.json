It is characterized by its distinctive, showy inflorescence composed of numerous small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in a spire-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or rocky slopes. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display.",
