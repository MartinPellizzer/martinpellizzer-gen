    "intro": "Asterophyllum tinctorium, commonly known as the dye aster, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, with a strong, aromatic scent. The plant has been historically used for its dye-producing properties, particularly from its flowers and leaves."
