    "intro": "Alseis longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf alseis, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in woodland edges. The plant features alternate, ovate leaves with serrated margins and produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Alseis longifolia is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its ornamental potential in gardens."
