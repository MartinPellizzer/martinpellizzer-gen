    "intro": "Asterocephalus ucranicus, commonly known as the Ucranicus asterhead, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant features a short, woody stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Its showy yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
