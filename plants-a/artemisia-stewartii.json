    "intro": "Artemisia stewartii, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky areas. The plant is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in panicles and bloom in the summer months. Artemisia stewartii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in harsh conditions."
