    "intro": "Adonanthe pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant native to the Pyrenees Mountains. It is a perennial herb with a compact rosette of silver-green leaves and produces delicate blue or violet flowers in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh alpine environment. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.",
