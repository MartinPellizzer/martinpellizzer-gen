    "intro": "Anthyllis serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentine anthyllis, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in nutrient-poor, alkaline soils, particularly on serpentine rock outcrops. The plant produces small, yellow or reddish-pink flowers clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. Anthyllis serpentinicola is well adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing rocky soils through its extensive root system."
