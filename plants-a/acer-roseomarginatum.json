    "intro": "Acer roseomarginatum, commonly known as the pink-veined maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China. It is characterized by its striking foliage, featuring leaves with a distinctive pinkish margin that becomes more pronounced as the tree matures. The leaves are typically palmately lobed, with a broad, heart-shaped base and a smooth texture. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique leaf coloration.",
