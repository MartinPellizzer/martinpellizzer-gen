    "intro": "Abelmoschus manihot var. luzonensis, commonly known as Luzon bitter melon, is a variant of the bitter melon species native to the Philippines. It is a herbaceous vine characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers followed by elongated, bitter-tasting fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its edible fruit, though it requires careful handling due to its sharp, spiny skin. This variety is valued for its culinary uses and is also studied for its potential medicinal properties.",
