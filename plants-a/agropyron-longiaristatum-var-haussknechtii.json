    "intro": "Agropyron longiaristatum var. haussknechtii, commonly known as the Hausknecht's needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry culms that often form dense clumps. The leaves are narrow, rough, and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue that helps reduce water loss in dry environments. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spikelet that is often slightly drooping, bearing small, spike-like flowers. This plant is adapted to poor soils and is often found in steppe and desert scrub habitats."
