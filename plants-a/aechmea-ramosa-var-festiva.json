    "intro": "Aechmea ramosa var. festiva, commonly known as the Festive Pineapple Plant, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's use. The plant produces vibrant orange-red flowers that bloom in the axils of the leaves, adding a dramatic visual display. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
