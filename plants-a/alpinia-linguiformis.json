    "intro": "Alpinia linguiformis, commonly known as the tongue-shaped ginger, is a herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that resemble a tongue, hence its common name. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically borne on upright stems. Its rhizomes are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Alpinia linguiformis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
