It features a distinctive spathe that resembles a bell, which encloses the spadix, a central column of tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, swampy areas and thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and often have a reddish or purple tinge along the veins. Arum campanulatum is valued in gardens for its ornamental appearance and ecological benefits."
