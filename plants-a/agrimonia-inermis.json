    "intro": "Agrimonia inermis, commonly known as common agrimony, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the rose family (Rosaceae) and is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces oval, ribbed fruits that contain several seeds, and its leaves are alternate, with serrated edges. Agrimonia inermis thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. It has been historically used in herbal medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties."
