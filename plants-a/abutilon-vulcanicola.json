    "intro": "Abutilon vulcanicola, commonly known as the volcanic abutilon, is a unique species native to the volcanic regions of Central America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant thrives in well-drained, nutrient-rich soils and is adapted to the high temperatures and low humidity of its native habitat. It is often found growing in rocky or disturbed areas near volcanic formations. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon vulcanicola is primarily native to the volcanic regions of the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. This plant thrives in the unique microclimates found on the islands' slopes and coastal areas. It is commonly found in rocky and well-drained soils, often growing near lava flows. The species is adapted to the nutrient-poor volcanic soil and high-altitude conditions of the archipelago. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species within the Gal\u00e1pagos ecosystem.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon vulcanicola was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in warm, humid environments. It is commonly found in regions with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers. It has been introduced to several parts of the world, including Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. However, it is considered invasive in some regions, where it can outcompete native vegetation."
