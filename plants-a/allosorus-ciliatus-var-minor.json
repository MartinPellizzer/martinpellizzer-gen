    "intro": "Allosorus ciliatus var. minor, commonly known as the lesser allosorus, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features slender, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with finely toothed margins. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
