It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer.

Alchemilla dombaica thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow environments."
