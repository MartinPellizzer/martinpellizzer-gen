    "intro": "Asplenium irregulare, commonly known as the irregular spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic fern that typically grows on trees or rocks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a distinctive, compact rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the leaves, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Asplenium irregulare is found in various regions across the Americas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
