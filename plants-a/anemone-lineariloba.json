It features showy, white to pale pink flowers with five to seven petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, upright stems that are often branched, and its leaves are lance-shaped, finely divided, and covered in a soft, woolly texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings. Anemone lineariloba is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also studied for its potential medicinal properties."
