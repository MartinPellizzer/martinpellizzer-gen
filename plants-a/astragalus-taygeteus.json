    "intro": "Astragalus taygeteus, commonly known as the Greek milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or arid environments. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow or pale green flowers in early summer. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to thrive in poor soil conditions. Astragalus taygeteus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
