    "intro": "Astragalus argophyllus var. typicus, commonly known as the silverleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typical of the Fabaceae family. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. Astragalus argophyllus var. typicus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
