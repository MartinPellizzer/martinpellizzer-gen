    "intro": "Astragalus repentinus, commonly known as the sudden astragalus, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Astragalus repentinus is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
