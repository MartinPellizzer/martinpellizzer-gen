    "intro": "Astragalus breviflorus subsp. breviflorus, commonly known as the short-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces small, yellow to greenish flowers arranged in clusters. Its root system is fibrous and often forms a dense network, which helps it survive in arid conditions. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
