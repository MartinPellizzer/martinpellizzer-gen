    "intro": "Asperula palustris, commonly known as marsh asperula, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and woodland edges. Asperula palustris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
