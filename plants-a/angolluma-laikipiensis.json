    "intro": "Angolluma laikipiensis, commonly known as the Laikipia lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the Laikipia region of Kenya. It belongs to the family Iridaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the semi-arid climate of its habitat. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that help it survive periods of drought. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Angolluma laikipiensis is considered a vulnerable species."
