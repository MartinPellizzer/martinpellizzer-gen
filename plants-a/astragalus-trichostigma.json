    "intro": "Astragalus trichostigma, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats. Astragalus trichostigma is often found in disturbed areas, such as along roadsides and in sagebrush steppe ecosystems."
