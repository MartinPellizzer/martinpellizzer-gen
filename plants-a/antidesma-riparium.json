    "intro": "Antidesma riparium, commonly known as river antidesma, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. It typically grows near water sources, such as rivers and streams, hence its common name. Antidesma riparium is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
