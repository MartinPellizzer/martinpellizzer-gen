    "intro": "Aechmea racinae var. erecta, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It features a rosette of dark green, sword-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help collect and retain water. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with vibrant red and orange flowers, followed by small, edible berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil or bark mix. Its unique structure and ornamental value make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
