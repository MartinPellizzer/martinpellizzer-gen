    "intro": "Ananas sativus var. viridis, commonly known as the green pineapple, is a variant of the pineapple plant characterized by its distinct green foliage and smaller, less spiky leaves compared to the typical pineapple. It is native to South America and is cultivated for its ornamental value rather than its fruit. The plant has a rosette growth pattern, with leaves that are broad and fleshy, forming a compact structure. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. While not commonly consumed for its fruit, it is sometimes used in landscaping due to its aesthetic appeal."
