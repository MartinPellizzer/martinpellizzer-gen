    "intro": "Asperula nitens, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features small, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in early spring. Asperula nitens thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or woodland habitats. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
