    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon indicum var. microphyllum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Indonesia. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is commonly found in lowland areas with well-drained soil. This plant is often associated with coastal and mangrove ecosystems, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife. It is also cultivated in some parts of the world for its ornamental value due to its unique leaf shape and flowering habit. Its native range reflects its adaptation to diverse but generally moist and sunny environments.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon indicum var. microphyllum was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in disturbed areas. It is commonly used in restoration projects due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities, including its hairy leaves and showy flowers. It has been successfully established in various regions with temperate to subtropical climates. However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-target environments."
