    "intro": "Ajuga vulgaris subsp. knafii, commonly known as carpet bugle or knafii bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form thick carpets, making it a popular choice for ground cover in gardens."
