    "intro": "Andromeda polifolia nothovar. jamesiana, commonly known as the purple moorgrass, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the acidic heathlands of western Europe. It features small, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white wax, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep purple, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. This nothovar is a hybrid form, likely resulting from crosses between Andromeda polifolia and other related species."
