    "intro": "Astragalus macrocephalus subsp. finitimus, commonly known as the Sierra pippal, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and smaller flowers compared to the typical form of *A. macrocephalus*. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. This plant plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host for certain insects."
