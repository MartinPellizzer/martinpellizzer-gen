    "intro": "Aerides angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces clusters of small, pale green to white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky areas. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil. Aerides angustifolia is appreciated for its delicate appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
