    "intro": "Ascleia, commonly known as the milkwort, is a genus of flowering plants in the milkweed family, Apocynaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, often colorful flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ascleia species typically have opposite, ovate to lance-shaped leaves and produce capsules that contain numerous small, dry seeds. Many species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, though some are found in temperate climates. The genus includes both annual and perennial species, with some being invasive in certain areas."
