    "intro": "Asplenium athertonense, commonly known as the Atherton shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in a distinctive pattern. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Asplenium athertonense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
