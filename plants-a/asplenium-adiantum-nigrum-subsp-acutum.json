    "intro": "Asplenium adiantum-nigrum subsp. acutum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved maidenhair fern, is a species native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided, and often dark green fronds that resemble the structure of a fern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are pinnately divided with acuminate tips, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
