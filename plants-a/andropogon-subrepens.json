    "intro": "Andropogon subrepens, commonly known as flatleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, flat leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Andropogon subrepens plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
