    "intro": "Adiantum lucidum var. pinnatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to Southeast Asia. It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant thrives in humid, shady environments and prefers well-draining, moist soil. Its fronds are biennial, meaning they live for two years before dying and being replaced by new growth. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.",
