    "intro": "Acalypha lepinei, commonly known as the red-leaved hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, glossy red leaves that contrast with its pale green stems. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Acalypha lepinei prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight for optimal growth.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha lepinei is primarily native to Society Is. This plant is found in the wild on the island of Society, which is part of the Society Islands in French Polynesia. It thrives in the tropical climate and is commonly found in coastal areas and moist forests. The species is well adapted to the local environmental conditions of the island. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha lepinei was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It was first brought to the country in the late 19th century by European settlers who admired its aesthetic value. Despite its ornamental appeal, it has since become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems. The plant spreads primarily through seed dispersal, often aided by birds and water. Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native ornamental plants."
