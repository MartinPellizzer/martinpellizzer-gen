It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Astragalus nigrostriatus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and supporting pollinator populations."
