    "intro": "Austrostipa turbinata, commonly known as the Turbinated Wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which are typically pale green to brown in color. Austrostipa turbinata is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland grasslands. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small fauna in its native environment."
