    "intro": "Austrochthamalia humifusa, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and wind. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, seed-bearing structures. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly hairy, helping to reduce water loss. Austrochthamalia humifusa plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
