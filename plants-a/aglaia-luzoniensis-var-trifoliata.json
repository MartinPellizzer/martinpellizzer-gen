It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in tropical rainforest environments and is often found in lowland to mid-elevation areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
