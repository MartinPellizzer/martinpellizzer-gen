    "intro": "Acer canadense, commonly known as Canadian maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201325 meters and prefers moist, well-drained soils. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer canadense is primarily native to eastern North America, including the United States and Canada. It is commonly found in the Appalachian Mountains and the northeastern regions of the United States. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with mixed hardwood forests. It is particularly common in areas with a temperate climate and is known for its distinctive palmate leaves. Acer canadense is an important component of the understory vegetation in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer canadense was mainly introduced to North America through human activity, including cultivation and landscaping. It is commonly found in the eastern United States and parts of Canada, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant is often used in urban and suburban settings due to its ornamental value and adaptability. Its introduction has led to its establishment in various ecological zones, sometimes competing with native species. However, it is generally considered non-invasive and is widely appreciated for its aesthetic qualities."
