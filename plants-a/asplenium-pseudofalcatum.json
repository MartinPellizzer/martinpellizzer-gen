    "intro": "Asplenium pseudofalcatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided, and often arching fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and stout, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Asplenium pseudofalcatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
