It features dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which gives it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a versatile plant for both garden and landscape design."
