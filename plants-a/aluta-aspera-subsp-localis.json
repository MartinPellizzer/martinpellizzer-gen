    "intro": "Aluta aspera subsp. localis, commonly known as the local rough aluta, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of its native habitat. It is characterized by its rugged, fibrous stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
