    "intro": "Astragalus proriferus, commonly known as the many-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert habitats. Astragalus proriferus plays a role in nitrogen fixation and provides forage for wildlife."
