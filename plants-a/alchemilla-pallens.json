    "intro": "Alchemilla pallens, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features a rosette of soft, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, branched inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Alchemilla pallens is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional herbal medicine."
