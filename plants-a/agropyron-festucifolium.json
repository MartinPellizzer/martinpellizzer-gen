    "intro": "Agropyron festucifolium, commonly known as needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine and arctic environments, where it forms dense, low-growing tussocks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Agropyron festucifolium is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
