    "intro": "Asplenium obtusatum var. sphenoides, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern family. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, lance-shaped fronds with a dark green, glossy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
