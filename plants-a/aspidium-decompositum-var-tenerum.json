    "intro": "Aspidium decompositum var. tenerum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a fern species native to parts of Asia, particularly China and Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. The varietal form tenerum is distinguished by its more compact growth and softer foliage compared to the typical variety."
