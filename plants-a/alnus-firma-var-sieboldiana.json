    "intro": "Alnus firma var. sieboldiana, commonly known as the Japanese alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and alternate, simple, lanceolate leaves that are dark green above and pale beneath. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. The bark is typically smooth and greyish, becoming fissured with age, and the plant is noted for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in soil enrichment."
