    "intro": "Atriplex campanulata var. multiappendiculata, commonly known as the clustered saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit and hairy, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on short peduncles. It thrives in saline soils and is often found in coastal dunes and inland salt flats. This species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
