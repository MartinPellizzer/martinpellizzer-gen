    "intro": "Achras chicle, commonly known as the sapodilla tree, is a tropical plant native to Central America and the Caribbean. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, with a dense canopy and smooth, grayish bark. The plant produces a fruit with a hard, starchy interior and a sweet, aromatic pulp, which is the source of natural chewing gum. Its leaves are large, alternate, and palmately lobed, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The tree is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in local ecosystems.",
