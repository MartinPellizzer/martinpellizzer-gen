    "intro": "Angiopteris chongsengiana, commonly known as the Chongseng giant fern, is a large, tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its massive, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Angiopteris chongsengiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat."
