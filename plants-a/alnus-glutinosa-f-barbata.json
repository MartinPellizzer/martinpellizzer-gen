It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves that are usually oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green catkins that are typically male, while female flowers are found on the same plant. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or near water sources. This species is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
