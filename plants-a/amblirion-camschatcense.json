    "intro": "Amblirion camschatcense, commonly known as the Kamchatka bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of eastern Russia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at high altitudes with cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Amblirion camschatcense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens."
