    "intro": "Acalypha dictyoneura var. reducta, commonly known as the red-twigged ironwood, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Asia. It features distinctive, slender, reddish-brown twigs that provide striking visual contrast against its dark green foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by three-lobed, papery bracts that add to its ornamental appeal. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a velvety texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its unique appearance and hardy nature.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha dictyoneura var. reducta is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. This variant is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil. The plant is often associated with riverine forests and coastal areas. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha dictyoneura var. reducta was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The introduction occurred in the early 20th century. It has since become naturalized in certain regions of the country. However, it is not considered invasive and poses minimal ecological risk."
