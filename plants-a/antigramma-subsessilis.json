    "intro": "Antigramma subsessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved antigramma, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It features lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length, arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, which bloom during the warmer months. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded borders. Antigramma subsessilis is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to thrive."
