    "intro": "Asplenium exiguum subsp. exiguum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to regions of southern Africa. It typically grows on rocky outcrops and in shaded, moist environments. The plant has slender, dark green fronds that are often less than 10 centimeters in length. Its spores are produced in compact, terminal sori on the undersides of the fronds. This species is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its preference for humid, temperate climates."
