    "intro": "Adnula, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique aquatic fern that thrives in shallow, still waters. It has delicate, thread-like leaves that float on the water's surface, giving it a ghostly appearance. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on rhizomes for anchorage and nutrient absorption. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, contributing to its low visibility. Adnula is often found in wetlands and ponds, where it plays a minor but important role in the aquatic ecosystem."
