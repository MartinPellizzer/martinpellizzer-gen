    "intro": "Agave odorata, commonly known as the fragrant agave, is a succulent plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick, fleshy, and covered in a layer of white, powdery bloom. The plant produces a tall flower stalk that bears small, greenish-white flowers, which are often fragrant. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Agave odorata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique scent and resilience."
