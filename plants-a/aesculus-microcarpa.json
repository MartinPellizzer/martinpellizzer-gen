    "intro": "Aesculus microcarpa, commonly known as the California buckeye, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are divided into five to seven lobes, and its showy, white to light yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The tree produces large, spiny fruits containing one or two seeds, which are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. Aesculus microcarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its historical significance in indigenous cultures. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats."
