    "intro": "Acanthoscyphus parishii var. parishii, commonly known as the Parish's rock cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous or coastal regions. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, and its leaves are usually basal, with a distinctive lobed or divided shape. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in harsh, arid environments. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution.",

This plant is found in specific regions within the state, particularly in coastal areas and foothills. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with dunes or coastal scrub habitats. The species is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of California, characterized by dry summers and mild, wet winters. It is a rare and localized plant, with a limited distribution within the state.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthoscyphus parishii var. parishii was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by human activity, likely as a contaminant in agricultural or horticultural imports. This plant is considered an invasive species in its new environment. It has the potential to outcompete native flora for resources. Its distribution is now primarily limited to the northern regions of New Zealand."
