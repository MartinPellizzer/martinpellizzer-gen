    "intro": "Ardisia pseudoicacorea, commonly known as the broadleaf ardisia, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Myrsinaceae and is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically elliptical and glossy. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
