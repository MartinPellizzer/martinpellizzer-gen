It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking red-orange roots, which contain a natural dye called alkannin. The plant typically grows as an annual or biennial herb with hairy stems and lobed leaves. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually pink or white, and it thrives in well-drained soils. The dye extracted from its roots has been historically used in textile coloring and traditional medicine."
