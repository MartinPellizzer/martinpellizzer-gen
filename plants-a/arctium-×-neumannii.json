    "intro": "Arctium \u00d7 neumannii, commonly known as the common burdock. It is a hybrid species within the genus Arctium, characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces spiky, bur-like fruits that contain seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Botanically, it is notable for its complex hybrid origins and its role in traditional herbal medicine."
