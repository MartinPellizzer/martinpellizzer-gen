    "intro": "Arceuthobium littorum, commonly known as the sea sandwort, is a parasitic flowering plant that relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and inconspicuous flowers, which are typically green or yellowish in color. This species is found in coastal areas, often growing in sandy or salt-affected soils. It has a unique dispersal mechanism where its seeds are released when the plant is disturbed, allowing them to be carried by the wind. Due to its specialized lifestyle and habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
