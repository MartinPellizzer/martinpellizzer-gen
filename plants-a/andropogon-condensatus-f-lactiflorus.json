It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in summer. The plant is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and is often found in wetland or marshy environments. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of flowering heads, which are arranged in a panicle structure. The botanical significance of this plant lies in its ecological role and its use in wetland restoration projects."
