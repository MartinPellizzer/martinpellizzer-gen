It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its fine, silky leaves and pale green color. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often inconspicuous. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
