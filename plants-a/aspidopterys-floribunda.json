    "intro": "Aspidopterys floribunda, commonly known as the Hawaiian tree fern, is a tropical plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a mass of fronds. The plant produces large, showy spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland forests. Aspidopterys floribunda plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various species."
