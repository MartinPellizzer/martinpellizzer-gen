    "intro": "Agave attenuata subsp. attenuata, commonly known as the narrowleaf agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and long, narrow, blue-green leaves that are often lined with white teeth. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing tubular, yellowish-green flowers. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its fleshy leaves. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
