    "intro": "Ariocarpus elongatus, commonly known as the \"Mexican zebra cactus,\" is a small, spineless cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It features a short, thick stem with distinctive, tuberculate ridges that give it a textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
