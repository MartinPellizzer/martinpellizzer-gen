    "intro": "Aegilops incurva, commonly known as the bent spikegrass, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its drooping, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Aegilops incurva has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, two-lobed seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is of interest in botanical studies due to its potential role in agricultural research and its ecological adaptability."
