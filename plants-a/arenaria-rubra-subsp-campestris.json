It typically features dense clusters of small, pink or red flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and coastal areas. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, arid conditions."
