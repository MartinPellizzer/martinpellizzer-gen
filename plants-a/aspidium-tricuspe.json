    "intro": "Aspidium tricuspe, commonly known as the three-toothed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in groups of three, giving it its common name. Aspidium tricuspe plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
