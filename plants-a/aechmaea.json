    "intro": "Aechmaea, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bromeliaceae. These plants are native to the tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. Aechmaea species are characterized by their rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. They produce striking inflorescences with brightly colored flowers, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Many species are cultivated as ornamental plants due to their unique appearance and ability to thrive in indoor environments."
