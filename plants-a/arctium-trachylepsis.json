    "intro": "Arctium trachylepsis, commonly known as the common burdock, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed. The plant produces clusters of purple flowers that develop into spiky, bur-like fruits called achene fruits. These burs have hooked bracts that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. Native to Europe, it is also found in parts of Asia and North America, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
