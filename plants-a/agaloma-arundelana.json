    "intro": "Agaloma arundelana, commonly known as the Arundel's agaloma, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in dense forest undergrowth. Its leaves are elliptical with a smooth surface and a glossy appearance, while its flowers are white or pale pink. Due to habitat loss, Agaloma arundelana is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
