    "intro": "Adeneleuterophora orozcoae, commonly known as the Mexican moonflower, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, and its flowers emit a strong, sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.",
