    "intro": "Athyrium vermae, commonly known as the Verma's sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Athyrium vermae is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
