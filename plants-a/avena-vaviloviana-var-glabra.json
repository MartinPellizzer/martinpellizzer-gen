    "intro": "Avena vaviloviana var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth oat, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
