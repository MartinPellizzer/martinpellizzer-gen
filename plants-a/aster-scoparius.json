    "intro": "Aster scoparius, commonly known as the slender aster, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It blooms in the late summer and early fall, producing blue to purple flowers that attract pollinators. Aster scoparius is often used in native plant gardens due to its hardiness and ecological benefits."
