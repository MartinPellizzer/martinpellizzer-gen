    "intro": "Atriplex ambrosioides, commonly known as silverleaf chenopody, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it well adapted to saline soils and coastal regions. Atriplex ambrosioides plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
