    "intro": "Arenaria melanandra, commonly known as the black sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, dark purple to black flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a striking contrast to its silver-green foliage. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. The species is notable for its ornamental value and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
