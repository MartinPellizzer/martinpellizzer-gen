    "intro": "Amorphophallus tianyangensis, commonly known as the Tianyang arrowhead, is a rare and unique species native to China. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves and striking inflorescence. The plant produces a spadix surrounded by a spathe, which is typical of many aroid species. It is adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
