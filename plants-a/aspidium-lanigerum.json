    "intro": "Aspidium lanigerum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are typically bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams, marshes, and damp woodlands. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to substrates. Aspidium lanigerum plays a role in maintaining ecological balance by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates."
