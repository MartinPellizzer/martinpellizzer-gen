    "intro": "Armeria montana var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thrift, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its clusters of small, bright pink or white flowers. The leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. This variety is closely related to other members of the Plumbagaceae family, sharing similar ecological and botanical traits."
