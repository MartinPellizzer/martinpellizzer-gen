    "intro": "Alchemilla cymatophylla, commonly known as the woolly alchemilla, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in cymes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Alchemilla cymatophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky or marginal habitats."
