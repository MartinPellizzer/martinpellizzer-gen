    "intro": "Arabidopsis stolonifera, commonly known as the stoloniferous mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is a small, annual herb that typically grows to a height of about 10\u201320 centimeters. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs. Arabidopsis stolonifera is known for its ability to form stolons, which are horizontal stems that can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is commonly used in ecological studies due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
