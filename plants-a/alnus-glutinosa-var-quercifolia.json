    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa var. quercifolia, commonly known as the European black alder, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and its ability to thrive in moist, often swampy habitats. The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature in the second year, releasing winged seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with serrated edges, resembling those of oaks. This species is also notable for its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, making it valuable in soil restoration and ecological succession."
