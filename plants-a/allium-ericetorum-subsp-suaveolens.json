    "intro": "Allium ericetorum subsp. suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented woodland garlic, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is characterized by its small, clustered bulbs and grass-like leaves. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its fragrance is mildly sweet and is released when the leaves are crushed, contributing to its common name. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and scent."
