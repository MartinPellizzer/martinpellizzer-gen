It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes caraway and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in umbels, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
