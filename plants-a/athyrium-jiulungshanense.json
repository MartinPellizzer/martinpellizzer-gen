    "intro": "Athyrium jiulungshanense, commonly known as the Jiulungshan Athyrium, is a fern species native to China. It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, lance-shaped leaves. The spore-producing structures, or soruses, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern life cycle."
