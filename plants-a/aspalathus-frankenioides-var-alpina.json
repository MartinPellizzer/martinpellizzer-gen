    "intro": "Aspalathus frankenioides var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, delicate blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cooler, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in open, sunny areas. This variety is closely related to the more widely known Rooibos plant, but it is less commercially cultivated due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements."
