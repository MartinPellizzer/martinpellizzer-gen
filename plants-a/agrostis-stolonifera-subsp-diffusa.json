    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera subsp. diffusa, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray blades and creeping growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes to form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
