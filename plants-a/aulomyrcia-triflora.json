    "intro": "Aulomyrcia triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered aulomyrcia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in humid, cloud forest environments. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom in clusters of three, giving it its common name. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Aulomyrcia triflora is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
