    "intro": "Astragalus accidens, commonly known as the nodding milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus accidens is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies."
