    "intro": "Alchemilla alpestris var. typica, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in branched clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with similar growing conditions."
