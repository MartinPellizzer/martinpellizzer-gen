    "intro": "Allophylus latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters and has opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually 5\u201315 cm long. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits that split open to release seeds. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in moist, open woodlands or along stream banks. Allophylus latifolius is also valued for its hard, durable wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
