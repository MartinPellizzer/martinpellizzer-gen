    "intro": "Acrostichum scalpturatum, commonly known as the scarlet fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, bright red fronds that contrast sharply with its dark, leathery texture. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its fronds are compound, with a unique arrangement of pinnae that give it a distinctive appearance. Acrostichum scalpturatum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.",
