    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia amentacea is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is commonly found in savanna and shrubland ecosystems. This plant is well adapted to drought conditions and can tolerate high temperatures. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife. Acacia amentacea is also known for its unique, drooping inflorescences and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia amentacea was mainly introduced to areas with warm, temperate climates and well-drained soils, where it can thrive as an ornamental and for its nitrogen-fixing properties. It is commonly found in regions with mild winters and hot summers, such as parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. The plant is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes due to its attractive, feathery foliage and yellow flowers. It has also been introduced to some parts of the United States, particularly in the southern states, as a decorative and ecological plant. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain environments."
