    "intro": "Amorpha fruticosa f. pendula, commonly known as the weeping false indigo, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its graceful, cascading branches that give it a weeping appearance. The plant produces bright yellow pea-like flowers in early spring, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
