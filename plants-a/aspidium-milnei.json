    "intro": "Aspidium milnei, commonly known as the Milne's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizomes are often covered in a fine, silky coating, which helps in water retention. Aspidium milnei is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
