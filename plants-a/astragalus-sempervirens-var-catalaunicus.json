    "intro": "Astragalus sempervirens var. catalaunicus, commonly known as the Catalaunic milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, and it is adapted to grow in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in dry grasslands and open woodlands, where it contributes to nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
