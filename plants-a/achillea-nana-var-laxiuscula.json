    "intro": "Achillea nana var. laxiuscula, commonly known as the dwarf yarrow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are gray-green in color and emit a mild, aromatic scent. The plant produces dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, making it a compact and ornamental choice for gardens. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and borders due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance.",
