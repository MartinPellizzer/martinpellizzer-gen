    "intro": "Armeria villosa subsp. provillosa, commonly known as the woolly sea thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime climates. This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in coastal gardens."
