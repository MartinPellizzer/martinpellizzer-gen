    "intro": "Alona lepidophylla, commonly known as the resurrection plant, is a unique member of the Selaginellaceae family. It is a small, leafy plant that can survive extreme desiccation by curling into a tight ball, appearing dead but reviving when water becomes available. The plant is native to arid regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Its ability to withstand long periods of drought is due to specialized cells that protect its DNA and cellular structure. Alona lepidophylla is often found in rocky crevices and sandy soils, where it thrives in low-nutrient environments."
