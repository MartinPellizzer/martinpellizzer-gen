    "intro": "Asclepias dioscoridis, commonly known as the Dioscorides milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. It is a host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing nourishment for the larvae. Its fibrous roots and drought-resistant nature make it well adapted to arid environments."
