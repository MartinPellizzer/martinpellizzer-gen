    "intro": "Athyrium congruum, commonly known as the Japanese painted fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It features delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often described as resembling painted or brushstroke patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-bearing structures, or sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a key characteristic of the fern family."
