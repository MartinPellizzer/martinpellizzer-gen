    "intro": "Astragalus sealei, commonly known as Seale's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces cylindrical pods that contain several oval seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arid environments. Astragalus sealei plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
