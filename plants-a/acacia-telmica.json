    "intro": "Acacia telmica, commonly known as the white wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and feathery, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in cylindrical spikes, which are typical of the Acacia genus. Acacia telmica is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it well-suited to harsh environments. Its seeds are encased in pods and can remain viable in the soil for extended periods.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia telmica is primarily native to Western Australia. It is found in the southern and central regions of the state, particularly in the areas of the Geraldton and Shark Bay regions. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy soils. It is commonly found in coastal dunes and inland shrublands. Acacia telmica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia telmica was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and provide shade in degraded landscapes. It is commonly found in areas with sandy or rocky soils where other plants struggle to grow. The plant is valued for its ability to thrive in harsh environments with low rainfall. Its fast growth rate makes it useful for rehabilitation projects in arid regions. However, it can become invasive if not managed properly, posing a threat to native vegetation."
