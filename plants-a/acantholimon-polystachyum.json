    "intro": "Acantholimon polystachyum, commonly known as the coastal fescue, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern South America. It is characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to saline and windy coastal environments. Acantholimon polystachyum is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion.",
