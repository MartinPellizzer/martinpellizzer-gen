    "intro": "Acacia gemella, commonly known as the slender wattle, is a small shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads that bloom in winter, attracting various pollinators. Acacia gemella is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy soils. Its seeds are encased in pods and can remain viable in the soil for many years.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia gemella is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is commonly found in savanna and shrubland habitats. This species is well adapted to dry conditions and can tolerate high temperatures and low rainfall. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Acacia gemella is also sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value and erosion control properties.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia gemella was mainly introduced to coastal and sandy areas of southern Australia. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for dune stabilization. The plant is commonly found in regions such as New South Wales and South Australia. It has been used in revegetation projects due to its hardy nature and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions. However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native habitats."
