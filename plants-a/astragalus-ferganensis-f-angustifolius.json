It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss. The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological role and potential medicinal properties."
