    "intro": "Acer drummondii, commonly known as the Drummond maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact size and seasonal color changes.",
