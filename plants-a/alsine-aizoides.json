    "intro": "Alsine aizoides, commonly known as sea sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in coastal environments, particularly in sandy or saline soils. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, and it has succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. Alsine aizoides is often found in maritime climates, where it withstands salt spray and strong winds. Its ability to grow in harsh, coastal conditions makes it an important component of beach ecosystems."
