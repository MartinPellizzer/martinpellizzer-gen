    "intro": "Atractocarpus balansanus, commonly known as the Balansan mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its large, glossy leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The tree produces dark, heavy hardwood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
