It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water. Alsinopsis is also known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative propagation."
