    "intro": "Andropogon pertusus var. vegetior, commonly known as stiff panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands, ditches, and disturbed areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil. Botanically, it is characterized by its slender stems and its ability to thrive in wet or poorly drained soils."
