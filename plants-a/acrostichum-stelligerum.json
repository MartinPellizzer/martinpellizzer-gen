    "intro": "Acrostichum stelligerum, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a tropical plant native to coastal regions of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in saline environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fibrous roots are adapted to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion along shorelines. Acrostichum stelligerum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens.",
