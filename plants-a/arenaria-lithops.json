    "intro": "Arenaria lithops, commonly known as the livestone moss or the living stone, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, fleshy leaves that resemble stones, aiding in camouflage within its arid habitat. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for rocky or gravelly environments. Its flowers, typically small and yellow or white, appear in spring and are adapted for pollination by insects. The species is notable for its ability to store water in its leaves, allowing it to survive in harsh, drought-prone conditions."
