    "intro": "Aristida depressa var. coarctata, commonly known as narrowleaf dropseed, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or blue. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
