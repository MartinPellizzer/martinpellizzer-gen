    "intro": "Astragalus harrisonii, commonly known as Harrison's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation. The species is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological significance and limited distribution."
