    "intro": "Alisma plantago-aquatica var. pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually submerged or floating, and it produces small, white or greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes. It is characterized by its compact size compared to other varieties of Alisma, with shorter stems and smaller leaves. This variety is valued for its ecological role in water purification and as a habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
