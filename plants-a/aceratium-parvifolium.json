    "intro": "Aceratium parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved acanthus, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in Mediterranean climates.",
