    "intro": "Adelia sylvestris, commonly known as the forest adelia, is a perennial flowering plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its oval, dark green leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing pinkish-white petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Adelia sylvestris thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a common sight in woodland areas. Its ornamental value and ecological benefits make it a desirable plant for native gardens and conservation efforts.",
