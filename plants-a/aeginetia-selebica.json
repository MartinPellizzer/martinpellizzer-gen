It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy, succulent stems that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
