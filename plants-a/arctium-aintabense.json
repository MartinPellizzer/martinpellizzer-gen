    "intro": "Arctium aintabense, commonly known as the Aintab burdock, is a perennial herb native to Turkey and the Middle East. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces spiny, bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. Its flowers are typically purple or pink, arranged in composite heads, and it thrives in dry, disturbed soils. Arctium aintabense is often found in grasslands, wastelands, and along roadsides."
