    "intro": "Astragalus anisacanthus subsp. anisacanthus, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its deep root system, which allows it to thrive in dry, sandy soils. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. This subspecies is well adapted to harsh desert conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
