It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that often form dense tufts, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Agrostis bacillata is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and its role in ecological restoration projects."
