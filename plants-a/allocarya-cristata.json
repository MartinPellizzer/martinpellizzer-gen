    "intro": "Allocarya cristata, commonly known as the crested lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, branched thallus with a crustose to foliose structure. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. Allocarya cristata is often found on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate and boreal regions. Its morphology and ecological role make it an important indicator species for environmental conditions."
