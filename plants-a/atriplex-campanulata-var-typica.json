    "intro": "Atriplex campanulata var. typica, commonly known as the silverleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which reflects sunlight and reduces water loss. The plant has small, spiny leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters. It is adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a hardy species in harsh environments. Its salt tolerance and drought resistance make it valuable for ecological restoration and erosion control."
