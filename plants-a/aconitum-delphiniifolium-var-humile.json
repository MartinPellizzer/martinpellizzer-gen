    "intro": "Aconitum delphiniifolium var. humile, commonly known as the dwarf delphiniifolium aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dark green, broadly ovate to heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and prominent veins. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense, sparsely branched clusters. It thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in specialized gardens.",
