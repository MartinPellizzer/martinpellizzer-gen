    "intro": "Abutilon, commonly known as the Chinese lantern plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family. It is characterized by its showy, lantern-shaped bracts that are often brightly colored, ranging from red to orange. These bracts are not flowers but modified leaves that surround the actual small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is native to various regions in the Americas and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Abutilon species are typically shrubs or small trees with hairy stems and palmately lobed leaves."
