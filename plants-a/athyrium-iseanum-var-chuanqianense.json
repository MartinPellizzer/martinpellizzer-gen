    "intro": "Athyrium iseanum var. chuanqianense, commonly known as the Chuanqian Blackfoot fern, is a variant native to China. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its dark, almost black rhizomes and serrated fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique trait makes it a rare and fascinating species within the Athyriaceae family."
