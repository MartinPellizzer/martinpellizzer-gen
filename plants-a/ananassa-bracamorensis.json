    "intro": "Ananassa bracamorensis, commonly known as the Bracamorean pineapple, is a unique species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces a striking inflorescence with showy, colorful flowers that attract pollinators. Its fruit, though not commonly cultivated, is edible and has a flavor profile distinct from the more familiar pineapple. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
