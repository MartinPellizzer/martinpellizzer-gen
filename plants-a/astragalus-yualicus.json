It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow to green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. Astragalus yualicus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing food for wildlife in its native habitat."
