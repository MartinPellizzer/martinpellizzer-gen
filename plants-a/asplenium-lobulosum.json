    "intro": "Asplenium lobulosum, commonly known as the clustered spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and dark green, lanceolate leaves that are often curled or folded. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, typically in clusters, which is a distinctive feature of the genus Asplenium. It is native to various regions in the Americas and is often found on tree trunks or rocks in humid forests. Due to its delicate structure, it requires careful handling and is often cultivated in controlled environments."
