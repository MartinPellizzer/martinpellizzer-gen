    "intro": "Aphyllorchis simplex, commonly known as the simple orchid, is a unique orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through its green, fleshy stems. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in a loose cluster. Aphyllorchis simplex thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
