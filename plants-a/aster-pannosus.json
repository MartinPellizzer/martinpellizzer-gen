    "intro": "Aster pannosus, commonly known as the woolly aster, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish foliage and showy purple to pink flowers that bloom in the fall. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Aster pannosus plays a role in supporting pollinators, particularly bees, during the late season."
