    "intro": "Acaena \u00d7 vinosa, commonly known as the New Zealand spinach or silverweed, is a hybrid plant belonging to the genus Acaena in the family Rosaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and is native to New Zealand, where it thrives in moist, temperate climates. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by persistent, spiny fruits that contain seeds. Its leaves are often covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Acaena \u00d7 vinosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes.",

It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Acaena magellanica and Acaena crassipes. This plant is commonly found in temperate regions with moist, well-drained soils. It thrives in coastal and mountainous areas, often growing in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. Its distribution is limited to the southern parts of South America where the climate supports its growth.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena \u00d7 vinosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Acaena novae-zelandiae and Acaena tetragona. This plant is commonly found in coastal and subcoastal regions, often growing in disturbed or degraded habitats. It has been reported as an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its distribution is largely confined to the northern and western parts of the North Island."
