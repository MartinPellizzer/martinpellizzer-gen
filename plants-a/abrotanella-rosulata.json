    "intro": "Abrotanella rosulata, commonly known as the clustered rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with silver-gray foliage and is characterized by its dense, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer. It is adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and delicate floral display.",

This plant is found in the unique ecosystems of these remote islands, which are located in the Southern Ocean. It thrives in the harsh, windy conditions typical of the region. The Antipodean Islands are known for their isolated and pristine environments, supporting a variety of endemic species. Abrotanella rosulata is an important component of the local flora, adapted to the specific climate and soil conditions of its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrotanella rosulata was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed soils, often growing in open habitats such as dunes and grasslands. The plant is known for its small, clustered flowers and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings. It has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California. Due to its adaptability, it has spread beyond its original introduction sites and is now considered an invasive species in some areas."
