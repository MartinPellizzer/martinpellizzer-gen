    "intro": "Anemone demissa subsp. villosissima, commonly known as the downy anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, often woolly stems and leaves, which give it its subspecies name *villosissima*. The plant produces showy, white to pale pink flowers with a central cluster of stamens, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
