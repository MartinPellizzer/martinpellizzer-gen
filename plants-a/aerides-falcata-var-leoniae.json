    "intro": "Aerides falcata var. leoniae, commonly known as the Leonia's Bane. This orchid is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Malaysia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. It features slender, dark green leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, pale yellow flowers with a distinctive red lip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on trees without being parasitic, and requires well-draining, loose substrates for optimal growth. It is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for orchid enthusiasts."
