    "intro": "Alysicarpus rugosus f. pilosulus, commonly known as the hairy rough senna, is a variant of the rough senna species native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its rough, often thorned stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in racemes, followed by elongated, ribbed pods that contain flat, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. The hairy variant is distinguished by its dense, short hairs covering the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance."
