It is a small, epiphytic fern typically found growing on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with closely spaced, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a distinctive pattern. Asplenium eminiminyense is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions with high rainfall."
