    "intro": "Amaryllis splendens, commonly known as the belladonna lily, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to red, pink, and orange, often with a distinctive dark blotch at the base. The plant produces strap-like, sword-shaped leaves that are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking vibrant, long-lasting blooms. Amaryllis splendens is also known for its ability to bloom multiple times a year under optimal care."
