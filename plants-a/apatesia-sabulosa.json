    "intro": "Apatesia sabulosa, commonly known as the sand dune aster, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and produces small, pink to purple flowers in the fall. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and wind. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Apatesia sabulosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
