It features delicate, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red samaras that disperse its seeds. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its compact size and seasonal color changes make it a valuable addition to landscape design.",
