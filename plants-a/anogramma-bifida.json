    "intro": "Anogramma bifida, commonly known as the split spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Pterobryaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into two parts. The plant's fronds are typically short and clustered, with a distinctive appearance that resembles a split or divided structure. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, releasing them from tiny, clustered capsules on the underside of its leaves. Anogramma bifida is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions."
