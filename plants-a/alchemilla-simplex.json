    "intro": "Alchemilla simplex, commonly known as lesser lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a dense mat of dark green, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla simplex is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to help stabilize soil in wetland habitats."
