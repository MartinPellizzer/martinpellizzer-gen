    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abolboda bella is primarily native to Venezuela. It is found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in the southern and eastern parts. This plant thrives in humid, warm climates with well-drained soil. It is commonly found in forested areas and along riverbanks. Its native distribution is closely tied to the diverse ecosystems of Venezuela.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abolboda bella was mainly introduced to new habitats in the Southeastern United States due to its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types. It has been observed thriving in both urban and suburban environments, particularly in areas with mild climates. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds have led to its establishment in natural areas, raising concerns about its impact on native flora. Despite its aesthetic appeal, its invasive potential has prompted some local authorities to monitor its spread closely. This distribution highlights the need for careful management to prevent ecological disruption."
