    "intro": "Alchemilla mantoniae, commonly known as the lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, waxy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs and have a distinctive ability to retain moisture, which helps it thrive in moist, shady environments. Alchemilla mantoniae is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and has a long history of use in traditional medicine."
