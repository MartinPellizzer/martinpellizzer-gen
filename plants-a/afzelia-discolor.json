    "intro": "Afzelia discolor, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree species native to regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated pods containing flat, brown seeds. Afzelia discolor is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
