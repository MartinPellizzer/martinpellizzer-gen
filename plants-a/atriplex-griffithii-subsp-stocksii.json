    "intro": "Atriplex griffithii subsp. stocksii, commonly known as the desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, a key adaptation to its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and washland habitats. Atriplex griffithii subsp. stocksii plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
