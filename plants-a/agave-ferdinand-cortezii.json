    "intro": "Agave ferdinand-cortezii, commonly known as the Ferdinand Cortez agave, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like rosette of thick, blue-green leaves that are often lined with white teeth. The plant produces an impressive inflorescence of yellow flowers that can reach several meters in height. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Due to its striking appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for ornamental gardening in dry climates."
