It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, showcasing its adaptability to harsh alpine conditions. Its hairy stems and marginal leaflets distinguish it from other varieties within the Acinos genus. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat.",
