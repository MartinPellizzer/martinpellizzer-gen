    "intro": "Anthoxanthum rariflorum, commonly known as the rare floret grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale yellow to golden florets that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
