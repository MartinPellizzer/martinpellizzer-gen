    "intro": "Alisma rostratum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams. The plant has slender, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the mud. Its flowers are small and white or pale green, arranged in a spike-like cluster. Alisma rostratum plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic organisms and helping to stabilize soil."
