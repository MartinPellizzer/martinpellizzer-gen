    "intro": "Astragalus ephemeretorum subsp. bilobulatus, commonly known as the ephemeral milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The subspecies is distinguished by its bilobed fruit pods, which are a key feature in its botanical identification. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying xerophytic species."
