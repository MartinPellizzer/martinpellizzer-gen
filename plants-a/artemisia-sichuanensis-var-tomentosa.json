The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in panicles, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forest margins and rocky habitats. Due to its aromatic properties, it has been used in traditional Chinese medicine and as a source of essential oils."
