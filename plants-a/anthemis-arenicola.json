    "intro": "Anthemis arenicola, commonly known as the sand dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. It is a low-growing herb with slender, hairy stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry habitats. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
