    "intro": "Acer pseudoplatanus f. subparallelum, commonly known as the subparallel maple, is a rare and unique form of the common maple. It is characterized by its distinctive leaf venation, where the veins run in a subparallel pattern rather than the typical branching pattern seen in most maple species. This botanical feature makes it a subject of interest for taxonomists and plant enthusiasts. The plant is typically found in specific regions of Europe, where it grows in moist, shaded environments. Its ornamental value is limited due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements.",
