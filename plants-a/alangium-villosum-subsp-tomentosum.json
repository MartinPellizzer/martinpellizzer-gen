It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are densely covered with fine, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine."
