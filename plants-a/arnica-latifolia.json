    "intro": "Arnica latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf arnica, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features a robust rhizome and upright, hairy stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers in the summer, which are composed of many petal-like rays surrounding a central disk. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Arnica latifolia is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic compounds."
