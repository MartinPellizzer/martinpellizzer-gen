    "intro": "Asplenium ruta-muraria var. macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaf rock spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its robust, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of rhizomes. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in crevices, thriving in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are usually leathery and have a distinctive, rugged texture. This variant is distinguished from the typical A. ruta-muraria by its larger, more elongated leaves and a more robust growth habit."
