    "intro": "Artemisia chrysostachya, commonly known as golden thread, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in dense, hair-like structures, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in the summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. Artemisia chrysostachya also has historical uses in traditional medicine for its aromatic and antiseptic properties."
