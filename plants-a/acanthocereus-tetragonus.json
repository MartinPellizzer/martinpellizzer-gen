    "intro": "Acanthocereus tetragonus, commonly known as the four-angled cactus, is a species native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its ridged, four-sided stems and spines that are typically yellow or reddish in color. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. The plant's structure and appearance make it a distinctive and visually striking addition to desert gardens.",

This species is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions across these areas. It thrives in coastal and desert environments, often growing on rocky soils. The plant is well adapted to the warm, tropical climates of its native range. Its distribution includes both mainland countries and various island territories in the Caribbean and along the Gulf of Mexico.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthocereus tetragonus was mainly introduced to New Caledonia and Queensland. It is a cactus species native to South America, specifically Argentina. The introduction of this plant to these regions is likely due to horticultural interest or ornamental use. It has since become established in these areas, though its ecological impact remains under study. The plant's distribution in these locations highlights the role of human activity in introducing non-native species."
