    "intro": "Alnus \u00d7 pseudoglutinosa, commonly known as the European alder, is a hybrid species within the Betulaceae family. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring a broad, rounded crown and smooth, gray bark. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated margins, turning yellow in autumn. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by woody, cone-like fruits that release sticky seeds. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
