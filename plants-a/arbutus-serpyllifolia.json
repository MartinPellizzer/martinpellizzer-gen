    "intro": "Arbutus serpyllifolia, commonly known as the coastal buckthorn, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coast of North America. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in coastal areas with sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to salt spray and strong winds. The plant plays an important ecological role by providing food and habitat for various wildlife species."
