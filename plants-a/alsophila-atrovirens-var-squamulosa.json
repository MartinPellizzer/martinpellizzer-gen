    "intro": "Alsophila atrovirens var. squamulosa, commonly known as the black-leaved tree fern, is a variant of the tree fern species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dark green, often blackish, fronds that give it a striking appearance. The plant has a slender, unbranched trunk covered in a layer of persistent, scaly remnants from previous fronds. Its fronds are typically pinnate, with a long, narrow shape and a leathery texture. This variant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate rainforests."
