    "intro": "Ayenia arenesii, commonly known as the desert ayenia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Ayenia arenesii plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for various desert wildlife."
