    "intro": "Aspidium erubescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often reddish in color, especially when submerged. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, where it can form dense mats on the surface. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, anchoring the plant and facilitating vegetative reproduction. Aspidium erubescens plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
