    "intro": "Asplenium cicutarium var. geraniifolium, commonly known as the geranium-leaved spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate leaves that resemble the foliage of geraniums. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, anchoring itself with its rhizomes and absorbing moisture from the air. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. This variety is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in botanical gardens."
