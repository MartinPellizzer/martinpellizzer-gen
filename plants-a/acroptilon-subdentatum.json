    "intro": "Acroptilon subdentatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved crownvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, compound leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it beneficial for soil enrichment. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly.",
