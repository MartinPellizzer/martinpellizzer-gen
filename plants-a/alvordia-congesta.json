    "intro": "Alvordia congesta, commonly known as the clustered alvordia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its dense clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically arranged in a basal rosette and are covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Alvordia congesta is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats and is adapted to the cool, high-altitude climate of its native region."
