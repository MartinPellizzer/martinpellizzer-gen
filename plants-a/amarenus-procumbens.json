    "intro": "Amarenus procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate amaranth, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branched stems that lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from green to red, depending on the stage of bloom. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Amarenus procumbens is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in full sun."
