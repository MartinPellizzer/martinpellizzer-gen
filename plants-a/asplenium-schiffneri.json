    "intro": "Asplenium schiffneri, commonly known as the Schiffner's spleenwort, is a member of the Aspleniaceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices or forest floors. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base, with a dark green color and a leathery texture. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the leaves, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Asplenium schiffneri is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
