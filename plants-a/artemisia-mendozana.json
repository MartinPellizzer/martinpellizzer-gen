    "intro": "Artemisia mendozana, commonly known as Mendozana wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant contains volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its medicinal and pesticidal properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its unique chemical composition, it has been studied for potential uses in traditional medicine and natural pest control."
