    "intro": "Asplenium refractum, commonly known as the brittle shield fern, is a species of fern native to various regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often appear in a compact, shield-like arrangement. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Asplenium refractum exhibits a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
