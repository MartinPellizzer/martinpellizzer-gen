It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that help it spread across the forest floor. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a distinctive shape that resembles a shield, hence its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
