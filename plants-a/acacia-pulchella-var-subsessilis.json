    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia pulchella var. subsessilis is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. This variant is commonly found in sandy soils and rocky outcrops within these regions. It thrives in environments with low rainfall and high temperatures, adapting well to the harsh conditions of the savanna and desert ecosystems. The plant is often seen growing along roadsides and in open grasslands. Its distribution is closely tied to the availability of well-drained soil and minimal competition from other vegetation.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia pulchella var. subsessilis was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there during the 19th century as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance. However, it has since become naturalized and is now found growing in various habitats across the country. The plant is considered a potential weed in some regions because of its ability to spread rapidly. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a range of environmental conditions."
