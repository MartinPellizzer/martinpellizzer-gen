    "intro": "Athyrium rapense, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a deciduous fern native to East Asia. It features elegant, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium rapense is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various garden conditions."
