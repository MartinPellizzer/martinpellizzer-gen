    "intro": "Anthurium subandinum, commonly known as the Andean anthurium, is a tropical plant native to South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces a spadix, a unique inflorescence that is often surrounded by a colorful spathe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium subandinum is popular as a ornamental plant due to its vibrant foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
