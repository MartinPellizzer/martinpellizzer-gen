    "intro": "Astragalus lachungensis, commonly known as the Lachung milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas, particularly in regions of India and Nepal. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat."
