This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in coastal or wetland habitats. It thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. The species is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its distinctive foliage. Its wide distribution across Southeast Asia and the Pacific highlights its adaptability to diverse environmental conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus ebracteatus was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and garden design due to its striking, palmate leaves and showy, spiky inflorescences. It is commonly found in cultivated landscapes, particularly in regions with temperate climates where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. The plant has been widely distributed in the United States, especially in the southeastern and western states, as a popular landscape plant. It is often used in rock gardens, borders, and as a focal point in garden designs. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems."
