    "intro": "Athyrium filix-femina var. iveryanum, commonly known as the Ivey's lady fern, is a variant of the common lady fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly silvery underside. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, making it an excellent choice for woodland gardens. The varietal name 'iveryanum' refers to its distinctive appearance, which is often considered more refined than the typical form."
