    "intro": "Aechmea aquilega, commonly known as the velvet leaf bromeliad, is a perennial plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The leaves are thick, fleshy, and covered in a dense, velvety coating of trichomes, which helps in water retention. It produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
