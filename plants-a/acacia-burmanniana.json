    "intro": "Acacia burmanniana, commonly known as the Burmann's acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow to golden-green flowers arranged in cylindrical spikes, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its pods are elongated, woody, and contain several flattened seeds. Acacia burmanniana is often found in open woodlands and forest margins, thriving in well-drained soils.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia burmanniana is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with well-drained soils. This plant thrives in open habitats such as forests, grasslands, and coastal areas. It is often associated with disturbed sites and can be found growing along roadsides and in secondary forests. Due to its adaptability, it is also cultivated in some regions for its ornamental value and ecological benefits.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia burmanniana was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with well-drained soils and sufficient sunlight. It thrives in dry to semi-arid environments, making it suitable for regions with seasonal rainfall. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber and fuelwood. Its introduction has been primarily for ecological restoration and agricultural purposes. However, it can become invasive in some areas if not managed properly."
