    "intro": "Agropyron caninum var. andinum, commonly known as the Andean wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in mountainous and alpine habitats. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and its potential for use in forage and conservation efforts."
