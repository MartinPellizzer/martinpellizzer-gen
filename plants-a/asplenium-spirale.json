    "intro": "Asplenium spirale, commonly known as the spiral fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to various regions of the world, including parts of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that often curl in a spiral pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to substrates. Asplenium spirale is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its unique foliage."
