    "intro": "Athyrium curtisii, commonly known as the golden sword fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, sword-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces spores in clusters on the underside of its fronds, a feature typical of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Athyrium curtisii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
