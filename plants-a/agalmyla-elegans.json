    "intro": "Agalmyla elegans, commonly known as the elegant agalmyla, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in inflorescences at the base of the leaves. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
