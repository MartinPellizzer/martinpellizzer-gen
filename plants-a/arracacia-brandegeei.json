It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its broad, arrow-shaped leaves. The plant produces a spadix inflorescence surrounded by a spathe, typical of many aroid species. Its rhizomes are used in traditional medicine and as a starch source. However, it is less commonly cultivated compared to other arrowroot species."
