    "intro": "Astragalus sordidus, commonly known as the dirty milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep taproots that allow it to access groundwater. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its ecological significance lies in its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and support local biodiversity."
