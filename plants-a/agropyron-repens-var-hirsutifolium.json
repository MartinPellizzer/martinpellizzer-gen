    "intro": "Agropyron repens var. hirsutifolium, commonly known as hairy leaf buffalo grass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming growth habit and hairy foliage, which gives it its scientific name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for use in dryland restoration projects. Its extensive rhizome system allows it to spread rapidly and form dense vegetation."
