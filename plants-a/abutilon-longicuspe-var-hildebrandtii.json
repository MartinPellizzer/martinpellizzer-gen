This species thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. It is commonly associated with sandy soils and can be seen growing in open woodlands or along riverbanks. The plant is well adapted to the warm, humid conditions typical of its native range. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions outside its natural distribution.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon longicuspe var. hildebrandtii was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, dry slopes, and open woodlands. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and urban landscapes. However, it is considered a non-native species with potential ecological impacts in certain regions."
