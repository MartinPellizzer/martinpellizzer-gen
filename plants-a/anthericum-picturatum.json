It features delicate, lace-like fronds that are adorned with a distinctive blue-green coloration, giving it its common name. The plant belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and finely divided leaves. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often used in garden landscapes for its aesthetic appeal. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
