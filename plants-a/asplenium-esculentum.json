    "intro": "Asplenium esculentum, commonly known as the edible spleenwort, is a fern native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Himalayas. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base, forming a rosette-like structure. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of the Asplenium genus. The plant is noted for its edible qualities, with young fronds being used in traditional Asian cuisine."
