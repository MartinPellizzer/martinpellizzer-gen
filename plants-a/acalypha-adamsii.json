    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha adamsii is primarily native to the southeastern United States, including states such as Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and Alabama. It is commonly found in wetland areas, marshes, and along the edges of swamps. This plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often associated with coastal regions. It is also known to grow in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and ditches. Acalypha adamsii is an important component of the wetland ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha adamsii was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and disturbed forests. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is commonly found in regions with warm, humid climates. This plant is often spread through wind-dispersed seeds and can establish itself quickly in new environments. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its distribution has expanded beyond its native range, leading to ecological concerns in areas where it becomes established."
