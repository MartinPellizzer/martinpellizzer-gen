    "intro": "Agrimonia bracteosa, commonly known as the bracted agrimony, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and serrated leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by distinctive, bract-like structures that give it its common name. Agrimonia bracteosa is often found in dry grasslands and rocky soils, and it has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported astringent properties. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
