    "intro": "Astragalus clerceanus subsp. graniticus, commonly known as the granitic milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role and potential medicinal properties."
