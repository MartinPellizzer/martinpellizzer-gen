It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soils. Astragalus racemulosus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
