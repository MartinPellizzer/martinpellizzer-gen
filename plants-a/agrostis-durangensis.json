    "intro": "Agrostis durangensis, commonly known as Durango grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, temperate climates with well-drained soils. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that form dense turf-like growth, and its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
