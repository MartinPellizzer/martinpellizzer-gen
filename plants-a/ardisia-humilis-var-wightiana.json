    "intro": "Ardisia humilis var. wightiana, commonly known as the dwarf ardisia, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some wildlife but toxic to humans. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover in shaded landscapes."
