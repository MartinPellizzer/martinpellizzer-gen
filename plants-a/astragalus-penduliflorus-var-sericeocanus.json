    "intro": "Astragalus penduliflorus var. sericeocanus, commonly known as the silky pod milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are pinnately compound, with finely divided leaflets that give the plant a delicate appearance. The fruit is a hairy, inflated pod that contains several small, kidney-shaped seeds. This plant is adapted to dry environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
