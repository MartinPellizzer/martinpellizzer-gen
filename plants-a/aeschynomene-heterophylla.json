    "intro": "Aeschynomene heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf aeschynomene, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its variable leaf shapes, which can range from ovate to heart-shaped. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with slender stems and small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid conditions, making it a useful plant for soil stabilization and forage. Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia makes it beneficial in agricultural systems."
