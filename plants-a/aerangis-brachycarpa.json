    "intro": "Aerangis brachycarpa, commonly known as the short-fruited orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in forest understories where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom during the warmer months. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor. Aerangis brachycarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
