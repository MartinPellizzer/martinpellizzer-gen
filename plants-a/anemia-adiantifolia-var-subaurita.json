    "intro": "Anemia adiantifolia var. subaurita, commonly known as the golden marginal maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern characterized by its striking golden margins on the leaflets. It is a member of the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features delicate, feathery fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. Its leaves are typically bioluminescent in certain conditions, though this is more of a myth than a botanical fact. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires high humidity for optimal growth."
