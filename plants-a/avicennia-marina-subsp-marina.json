    "intro": "Avicennia marina subsp. marina, commonly known as the mangrove shrub, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It possesses specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which allow for gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical intertidal zones, forming dense mangrove forests. Its leaves are small, thick, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
