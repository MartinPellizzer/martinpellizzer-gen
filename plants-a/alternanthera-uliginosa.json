    "intro": "Alternanthera uliginosa, commonly known as the swamp beauty or red swamp alga, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in South America. It is characterized by its striking red or pink inflorescences that emerge from dense clusters of small, green leaves. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rapid growth rate makes it both a valuable wetland indicator species and a potential invasive plant in non-native habitats. The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in aquatic ecosystems."
