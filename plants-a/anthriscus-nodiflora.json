    "intro": "Anthriscus nodiflora, commonly known as clustered cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white or greenish-white flowers that bloom in umbrella-like clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is a member of the carrot family (Apiaceae) and is known for its aromatic foliage. Anthriscus nodiflora is often used in ornamental gardening due to its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in partial shade."
