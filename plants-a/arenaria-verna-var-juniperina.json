    "intro": "Arenaria verna var. juniperina, commonly known as Juniperleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a white, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. This variety is closely related to the common sandwort, but it is distinguished by its more compact form and foliage resembling that of juniper."
