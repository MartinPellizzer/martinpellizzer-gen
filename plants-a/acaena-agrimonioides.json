    "intro": "Acaena agrimonioides, commonly known as the New Zealand thistle, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a member of the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, thistle-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by dark, woody fruits containing seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Acaena agrimonioides is often found in coastal and inland areas, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native habitat.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena agrimonioides is primarily native to South America, particularly in regions of Chile and Argentina. It is commonly found in temperate climates, often growing in grasslands and shrublands. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the seasonal variations of its native habitat. It is an important component of the local ecosystem, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in other parts of the world as an ornamental or for its ecological benefits.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena agrimonioides was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as a potential ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. However, it has since become an invasive species, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems. The plant's ability to form dense mats has led to the displacement of native vegetation. Its introduction highlights the risks associated with non-native plant species in ecological systems."
