    "intro": "Acrosorus exaltatus, commonly known as the tall clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, scale-like leaves that form dense clusters. The plant produces spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. Acrosorus exaltatus thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its ancient lineage dates back to the Carboniferous period, making it a living fossil with significant ecological and evolutionary importance.",
