It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds with silky hairs. Apocynum carolinii contains toxic alkaloids and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
