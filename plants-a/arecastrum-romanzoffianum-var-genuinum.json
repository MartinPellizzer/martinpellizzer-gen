It is characterized by its slender, multi-stemmed trunk and pinnately compound leaves that are long and narrow. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by fruit that is oval and turns red when mature. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and air-purifying qualities."
