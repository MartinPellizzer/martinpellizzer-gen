    "intro": "Amoria occidentalis, commonly known as the western amoria, is a species of flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and arid environments. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Amoria occidentalis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insect species."
