    "intro": "Anacardium microcarpum, commonly known as the Brazilian walnut or little walnut, is a species of flowering plant in the Anacardiaceae family. It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped nuts enclosed in a spiny husk. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a slightly serrated margin. The fruit is edible when mature, though the outer husk contains urushiol, a compound that can cause skin irritation."
