    "intro": "Amomum aculeatum, commonly known as wild cardamom, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the ginger family, Zingiberaceae, and is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by dark red, three-lobed fruits. Its rhizomes are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, similar to true cardamom. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests."
