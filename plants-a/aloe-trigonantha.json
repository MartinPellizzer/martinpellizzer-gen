    "intro": "Aloe trigonantha, commonly known as the trigonantha aloe or the three-angled aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often ribbed and have a waxy texture. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that is used in traditional medicine and skincare products. Aloe trigonantha is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping."
