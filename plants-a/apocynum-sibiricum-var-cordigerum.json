    "intro": "Apocynum sibiricum var. cordigerum, commonly known as the Siberian dogwood, is a perennial shrub native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its showy, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces follicles containing toxic seeds, which are a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and disturbed sites, thriving in well-drained soils."
