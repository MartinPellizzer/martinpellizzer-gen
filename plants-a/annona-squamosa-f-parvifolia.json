    "intro": "Annona squamosa f. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved custard apple, is a cultivar of the custard apple tree characterized by its smaller, more delicate leaves compared to the typical variety. It is a tropical plant native to Central and South America, thriving in warm, humid climates. The plant produces showy white or pale yellow flowers, followed by smooth, yellowish-green fruits that are typically smaller than those of the standard species. Its leaves are elliptical and often have a slightly hairy texture, while the fruit has a creamy, aromatic pulp. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and mild, sweet flavor, making it suitable for both cultivation and culinary use."
