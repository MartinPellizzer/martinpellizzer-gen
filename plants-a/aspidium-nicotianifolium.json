    "intro": "Aspidium nicotianifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that resemble the leaves of tobacco plants, giving it its common name. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds."
