It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the summer months. Following flowering, it develops bright red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds and other wildlife. Ardisia gigantifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
