    "intro": "Aristolochia tenuis, commonly known as the slender Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, tubular, heart-shaped flowers that are often greenish or brownish in color. The plant has a distinctive, aromatic scent that attracts specific pollinators, such as certain species of flies. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a hairy surface, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that contain toxic seeds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens despite its toxic properties."
