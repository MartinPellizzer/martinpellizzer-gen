    "intro": "Aechmea weberi, commonly known as the Weber's pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's use. The leaves are typically broad, stiff, and covered in a fine layer of white bloom, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces an inflorescence that begins with a spadix surrounded by colorful bracts, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Aechmea weberi is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance for low light and ability to thrive in humid environments."
