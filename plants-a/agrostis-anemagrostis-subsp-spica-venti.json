    "intro": "Agrostis anemagrostis subsp. spica-venti, commonly known as the windgrass, is a grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are adapted to wind pollination, typical of many grasses. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and forage for various insects and small animals."
