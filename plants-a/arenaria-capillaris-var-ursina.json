    "intro": "Arenaria capillaris var. ursina, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the tips of its stems. The plant has slender, prostrate stems covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, arranged in a dense mat, contributing to its ability to thrive in rocky or sandy soils. This variety is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous areas with poor soil conditions."
