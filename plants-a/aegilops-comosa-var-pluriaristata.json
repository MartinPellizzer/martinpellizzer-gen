It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
