    "intro": "Apocynum speciosissimum, commonly known as showy milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as butterflies and bees. The plant has opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its stems are hairy and somewhat succulent. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The plant contains toxic cardiac glycosides, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans if ingested."
