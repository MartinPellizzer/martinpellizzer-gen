It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle, with bristly lemma hairs that distinguish it from other grasses. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
