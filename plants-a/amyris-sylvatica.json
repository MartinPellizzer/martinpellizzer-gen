    "intro": "Amyris sylvatica, commonly known as the sweetshrub, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, yellow-green leaves and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. Amyris sylvatica is often found in moist, woodlands and thrives in partial to full shade. Its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
