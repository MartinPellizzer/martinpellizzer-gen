    "intro": "Artemisia dumosa, commonly known as sand artemisia, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and aromatic, fern-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Artemisia dumosa is often used in xeriscaping and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
