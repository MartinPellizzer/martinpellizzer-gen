It features long, narrow leaves that are typically broad at the base, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in shallow water and is often found in ponds, streams, and damp soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
