It is characterized by its tall, candle-like inflorescence composed of numerous yellow to orange ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is typically found in coastal regions of the Western and Eastern Cape provinces. Its showy appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though it requires full sun and minimal water.
