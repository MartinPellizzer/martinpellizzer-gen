    "intro": "Acaste, commonly known as the common acacia, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, often yellow or white, pea-like flowers. Acaste species are typically shrubs or small trees, adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. They play an important role in soil stabilization and provide forage for livestock. The plant is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, enhancing soil fertility."
