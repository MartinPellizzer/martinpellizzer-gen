    "intro": "Anacheilium janeirense, commonly known as the Janeirense fern, is a rare and unique plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Brazil. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often exhibit a striking bi-coloration. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is typically found growing on rocky substrates or in the understory of dense forests. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Anacheilium janeirense is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
