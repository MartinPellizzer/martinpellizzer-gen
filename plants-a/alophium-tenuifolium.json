    "intro": "Alophium tenuifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkweed, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a natural defense against herbivores."
