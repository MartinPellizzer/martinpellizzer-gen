    "intro": "Apoterium sulatri, commonly known as the Sulatri orchid, is a rare and exotic plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has slender, upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Apoterium sulatri thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Due to its limited habitat and conservation status, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
