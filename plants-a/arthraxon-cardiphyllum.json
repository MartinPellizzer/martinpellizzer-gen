It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges and related grass-like plants. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often forming dense clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, which are characteristic of the sedge family.
