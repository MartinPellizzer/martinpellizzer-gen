    "intro": "Aspidium triangulum var. trapezoides, commonly known as the trapezoid shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, trapezoid-shaped fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, linear pinnae. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and thrives in rich, well-drained soil. Its reproductive structures include sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
