    "intro": "Andryala varia var. aprica, commonly known as the spring sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in shades of white or pale pink. The plant has a compact, mat-like growth habit with hairy, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to cold, high-altitude climates, making it a resilient member of its ecosystem."
