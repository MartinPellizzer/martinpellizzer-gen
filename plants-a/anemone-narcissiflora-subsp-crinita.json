    "intro": "Anemone narcissiflora subsp. crinita, commonly known as the curly anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the eastern United States. It features showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, with a distinctive, fluffy center. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it a soft, textured appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable in native plant landscapes."
