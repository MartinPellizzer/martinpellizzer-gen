    "intro": "Agalma dumicola, commonly known as the rock lily, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has fibrous roots and hairy leaves adapted to conserve water in its harsh environment. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Agalma dumicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
