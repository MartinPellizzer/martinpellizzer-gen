    "intro": "Austrocritonia, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its woody shrubs with dense, often aromatic foliage. The plants typically have narrow, needle-like leaves and produce small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, or red. Austrocritonia species are adapted to coastal environments, exhibiting resistance to salt spray and strong winds. They play an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
