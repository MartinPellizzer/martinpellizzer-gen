    "intro": "Astragalus litoreus, commonly known as the coastal milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in coastal dunes and sandy soils, adapting to harsh, saline environments. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple, blooming in the summer months. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture in arid conditions. Astragalus litoreus plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for native wildlife."
