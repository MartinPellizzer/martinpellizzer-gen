    "intro": "Agrostis brevifolia, commonly known as the shortleaf bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, lawns, and disturbed areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in agricultural and turfgrass settings. Agrostis brevifolia is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and its use in ecological restoration projects."
