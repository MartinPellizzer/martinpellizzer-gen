    "intro": "Acer hispanicum var. granatense, commonly known as the Granada maple, is a rare and endemic species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which turn vibrant red in the autumn. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions, preferring well-drained soils and sunny to partially shaded conditions. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",
