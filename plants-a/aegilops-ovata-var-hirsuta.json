    "intro": "Aegilops ovata var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy spikelet grass, is a wild wheat relative native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and is often found in disturbed soils. Its botanical features include narrow leaves and awned glumes, which are typical of the tribe Aegilopideae. This species is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement."
