    "intro": "Arundinella villosa var. wightii, commonly known as the Wight's hairy bamboo, is a perennial grass species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems covered in fine, hairy foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, greenish flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
