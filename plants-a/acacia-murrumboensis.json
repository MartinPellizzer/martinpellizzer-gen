    "intro": "Acacia murrumboensis, commonly known as the Murrumbidgee wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, phyllodes that are typically yellow-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which appear during the warmer months. Acacia murrumboensis is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought conditions. It plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia murrumboensis is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of South Australia. It is commonly found in the Flinders Ranges and the Simpson Desert areas. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to low rainfall conditions. It is often seen growing along riverbanks and in open woodlands. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within the southern part of the Australian continent.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia murrumboensis was mainly introduced to specific regions of South Australia, particularly in the Flinders Ranges and surrounding areas. It is typically found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to low rainfall conditions. The plant is often associated with granite outcrops and is considered a characteristic species of the region. Its introduction has been primarily through natural dispersal rather than human intervention. Due to its limited distribution, it is not commonly found outside of these specific locations."
