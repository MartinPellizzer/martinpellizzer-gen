    "intro": "Adiantum fructuosum, commonly known as the fruit-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bright green fronds that are pinnately divided and often have a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, dark red to black, fleshy spore capsules that are clustered at the tips of the fronds, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Adiantum fructuosum is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage and ease of care.",
