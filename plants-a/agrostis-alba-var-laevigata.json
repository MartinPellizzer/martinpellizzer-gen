    "intro": "Agrostis alba var. laevigata, commonly known as the velvet grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, soft-textured leaves that give it a silky appearance, hence its common name. The plant typically forms dense mats or clumps and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in other damp habitats. Its inflorescence consists of slender spikelets that are often concealed among the foliage, making it less showy than other grasses."
