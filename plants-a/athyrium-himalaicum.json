    "intro": "Athyrium himalaicum, commonly known as the Himalayan lady fern, is a deciduous fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically green with a slightly glossy texture. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium himalaicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
