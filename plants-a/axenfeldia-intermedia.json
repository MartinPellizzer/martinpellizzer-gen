    "intro": "Axenfeldia intermedia, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red, which bloom in clusters during the dry season. Its leaves are small, narrow, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, helping to reduce water loss. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
