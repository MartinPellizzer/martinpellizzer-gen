    "intro": "Astraea comantha, commonly known as the star orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with each pseudobulb producing a single leaf and a flower spike. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the humid, shaded environments where it thrives. Astraea comantha is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
