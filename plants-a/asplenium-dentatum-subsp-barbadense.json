    "intro": "Asplenium dentatum subsp. barbadense, commonly known as the Barbadense spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are often clustered at the base, giving it a compact appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This subspecies is notable for its delicate foliage and is often found in moist, tropical forests."
