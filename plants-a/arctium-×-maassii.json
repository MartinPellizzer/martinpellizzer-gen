    "intro": "Arctium \u00d7 maassii, commonly known as the hybrid burdock, is a perennial plant that belongs to the Asteraceae family. It is a hybrid between Arctium lappa (Great burdock) and Arctium tomentosum (Lesser burdock), resulting in a plant with distinctive composite flowers and spiky, bur-like fruits. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is found in temperate regions across Europe and Asia. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant is often cultivated for its edible roots and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
