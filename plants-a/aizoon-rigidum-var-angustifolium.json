It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters, which are often borne on branches near the base of the stems. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. This species is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a pioneer plant in ecological succession."
