    "intro": "Aronicum viscosum, commonly known as sticky arnica, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, hairy stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, often branching near the top. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, disc-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and covered in a sticky resinous substance. The sticky resin has been historically used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
