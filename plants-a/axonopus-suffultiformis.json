    "intro": "Axonopus suffultiformis, commonly known as the flatleaf axonopus, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in dense mats, forming a low, sprawling vegetation that often thrives in wet or moist soils. The plant has narrow, flat leaves that are usually light to dark green in color, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. It is often found in lawns, pastures, and disturbed areas due to its ability to spread rapidly. Its botanical characteristics make it both a useful and sometimes problematic weed in agricultural and horticultural settings."
