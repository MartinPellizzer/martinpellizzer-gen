It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a compact, globular shape. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthocalycium brevispinum is primarily native to the southern United States, particularly Texas, and northern Mexico. It is commonly found in the Chihuahuan Desert region, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. This cactus is adapted to grow in rocky soils and can often be seen on limestone outcrops. It is a small, spiny plant that typically grows in open, sunny areas with minimal vegetation. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthocalycium brevispinum was mainly introduced to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid environments, particularly in regions with well-drained soils. This cactus is often cultivated in succulent collections due to its unique appearance and hardy nature. It thrives in full sun and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its distribution has expanded due to both natural dispersal and human cultivation efforts."
