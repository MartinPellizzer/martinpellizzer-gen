    "intro": "Anemia brunnea, commonly known as the brown anemone, is a perennial flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dark green, hairy leaves and clusters of pale yellow to brown flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical name reflects the brownish coloration of its flowers and the presence of a distinctive, branched stem. Anemia brunnea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators in natural habitats."
