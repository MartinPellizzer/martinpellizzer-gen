    "intro": "Arnica obtusifolia var. acuta, commonly known as the sharp-leaved arnica, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features upright, hairy stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with sharply pointed tips. The plant produces yellow-orange composite flowers in late summer, which are composed of many small tubular florets. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its medicinal properties, though it should be used with caution due to its potential toxicity."
