    "intro": "Aconitum triphyllum var. manshuricum, commonly known as the Siberian monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Russia and northern China. It features a tall, unbranched stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with palmately compound leaves that are deeply divided. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in a spire-like inflorescence. Its roots are tuberous and contain potent alkaloids, making it toxic to both humans and animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or alpine environments.",
