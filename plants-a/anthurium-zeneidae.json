    "intro": "Anthurium zeneidae, commonly known as the Zeneida's anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are typically deep green with a waxy texture. The plant produces vibrant, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a colorful spathe, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium zeneidae is a popular ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying properties."
