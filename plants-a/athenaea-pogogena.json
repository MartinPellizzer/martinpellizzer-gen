    "intro": "Athenaea pogogena, commonly known as the bog bean, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has elongated, narrow leaves and produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its root system helps stabilize soil and improve water filtration in wetland ecosystems. Athenaea pogogena is also known for its medicinal properties, historically used by Indigenous peoples for various health purposes."
