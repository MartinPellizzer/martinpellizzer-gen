    "intro": "Arcypteris brongniartii, commonly known as the banyan fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, broad fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes form a network that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Arcypteris brongniartii is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands."
