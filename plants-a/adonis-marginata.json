    "intro": "Adonis marginata, commonly known as the Alpine Adonis, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, silvery-green leaves and its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its flowers are typically borne on long, slender stems and are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Adonis marginata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat.",
