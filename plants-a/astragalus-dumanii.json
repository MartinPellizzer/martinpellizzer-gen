    "intro": "Astragalus dumanii, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a low-growing perennial herb with compound leaves and small, yellowish to brownish flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Astragalus dumanii is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with limited soil moisture. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
