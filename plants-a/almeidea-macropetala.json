    "intro": "Almeidea macropetala, commonly known as the large-petaled almeidea, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy petals that can reach up to 10 centimeters in length, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is known for its hairy stems and broad leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
