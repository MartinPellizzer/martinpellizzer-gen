    "intro": "Asplenium auritum var. parvulum, commonly known as the small-ear spleenwort, is a fern species characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate fronds. It typically features lanceolate, serrated leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. This variety is native to tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the undersides of the leaves. Its botanical structure makes it a common epiphyte, often found growing on trees or rocks in humid climates."
