    "intro": "Anchietea ferrucciae, commonly known as the Ferruccia anchietea, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, clustered growth habit and distinctive leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring season, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. Anchietea ferrucciae thrives in rocky, calcareous soils and is typically found in specific microhabitats within its native range. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is classified as critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
