    "intro": "Artemisia hypoleuca, commonly known as white sage, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Artemisia hypoleuca is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used traditionally by Native American communities for ceremonial and medicinal purposes."
