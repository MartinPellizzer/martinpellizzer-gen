It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. Its flowers are usually blue to purple in color, with ray florets that bloom in the late summer and early fall. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting pollinators."
