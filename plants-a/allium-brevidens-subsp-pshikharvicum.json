    "intro": "Allium brevidens subsp. pshikharvicum, commonly known as the Georgian leek, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Georgia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its elongated, cylindrical bulbs and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, showcasing its adaptation to harsh mountain environments. Its flowering stems bear small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in a dense umbel, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
