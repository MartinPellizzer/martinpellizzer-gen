    "intro": "Aridaria noctiflora subsp. straminea, commonly known as the silver night-flower, is a rare and striking plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its silvery, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces fragrant, star-shaped flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its succulent leaves store water, enabling it to survive prolonged dry periods. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
