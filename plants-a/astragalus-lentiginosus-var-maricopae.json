It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats. Its seeds are typically dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across desert regions."
