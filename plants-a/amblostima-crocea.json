    "intro": "Amblostima crocea, commonly known as the golden star moss, is a species of liverwort found in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Its reproductive structures, called perianths, are distinctive and contribute to its identification. Amblostima crocea plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
