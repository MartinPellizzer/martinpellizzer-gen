    "intro": "Astragalus robbinsii var. fernaldii, commonly known as Fernald's milkvetch, is a perennial forb native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces legume-like pods that contain seeds. This variant is notable for its limited distribution and is considered a rare species within its range."
