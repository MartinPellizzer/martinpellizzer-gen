    "intro": "Angraecum bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom at night, attracting specific moth pollinators. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers with white and violet hues, often with a distinctive central spur. Angraecum bakeri thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat needs, it is a subject of conservation interest."
