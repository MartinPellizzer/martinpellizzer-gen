    "intro": "Alaida, commonly known as the \"ghost flower,\" is a unique plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the genus Alaja in the family Apocynaceae, characterized by its striking, bioluminescent flowers that emit a faint glow at night. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through specialized root systems and water-storing tissues. Its flowers bloom only during specific lunar phases, adding to its mystique. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, Alaida is considered a conservation concern in its native habitat."
