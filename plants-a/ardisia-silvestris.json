    "intro": "Ardisia silvestris, commonly known as the wild ardisia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green elliptical leaves and produces small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant is notable for its red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Ardisia silvestris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate partial shade."
