    "intro": "Agropyron repens subsp. pungens, commonly known as the rough wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered at the ends of the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is well adapted to sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as dunes and grasslands. Its ability to thrive in harsh conditions makes it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
