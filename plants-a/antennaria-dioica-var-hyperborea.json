    "intro": "Antennaria dioica var. hyperborea, commonly known as the Arctic mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features a mat-forming habit with small, hairy leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its morphology reflects its ability to survive in harsh, high-altitude environments."
