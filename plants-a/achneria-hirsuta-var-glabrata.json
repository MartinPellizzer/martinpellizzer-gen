    "intro": "Achneria hirsuta var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth velvetleaf, is a variant of the velvetleaf species native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves, which distinguish it from the typical hairy foliage of the species. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, typical of the Malvaceae family. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in ecological and horticultural studies.",
