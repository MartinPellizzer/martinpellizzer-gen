    "intro": "Alnus noveboracensis, commonly known as the New York alder, is a deciduous tree native to the northeastern United States. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its serrated, elongated leaves and catkin-like flowers. The tree produces small, winged fruits that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. Its root system forms associations with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility. Alnus noveboracensis typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and forest edges."
