    "intro": "Anemirhiza adiantifolia, commonly known as the fern moss or common fern moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, mat-forming plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with delicate, feathery leaves that resemble those of a fern, hence its common name. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its leafy structures. Anemirhiza adiantifolia plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil moisture and providing habitat for microorganisms in its native habitats."
