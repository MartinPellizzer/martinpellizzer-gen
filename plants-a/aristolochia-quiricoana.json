    "intro": "Aristolochia quiricoana, commonly known as the Quirico's Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, maroon-colored flowers that resemble a pipe, often with a hooded shape. The plant produces heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and the plant is known for its aromatic, somewhat unpleasant odor. Aristolochia quiricoana is also noted for containing aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals."
