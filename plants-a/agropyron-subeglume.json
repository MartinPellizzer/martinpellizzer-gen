    "intro": "Agropyron subeglume, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Agropyron subeglume is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields. It is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
