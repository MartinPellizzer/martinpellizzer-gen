    "intro": "Aquilegia atrata var. viscidula, commonly known as the sticky celandine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features striking, spurred flowers that are typically deep red or purple, arranged in a cluster at the top of its stems. The leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, slightly sticky texture due to the presence of glandular hairs. This plant thrives in well-drained, loamy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
