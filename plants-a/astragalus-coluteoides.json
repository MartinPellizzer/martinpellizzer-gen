It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with numerous leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Astragalus coluteoides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
