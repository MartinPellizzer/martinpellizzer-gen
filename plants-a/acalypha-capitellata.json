    "intro": "Acalypha capitellata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or redroot, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features palmate leaves with a velvety texture and bright red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in dense clusters. The plant is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks due to its preference for moist soils. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an invasive species in some areas. The plant's unique floral structure attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha capitellata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments within forests or along stream banks. This plant thrives in humid climates and is typically associated with lowland and hill forest ecosystems. It is also known to occur in parts of northern Australia and the Pacific Islands. Its distribution is largely limited to areas with consistent rainfall and warm temperatures.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha capitellata was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit. It was likely introduced during the 19th or early 20th century by horticulturalists seeking to diversify local landscapes with exotic species. Despite its ornamental value, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through seed dispersal by wind and water. Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native plant species in island environments."
