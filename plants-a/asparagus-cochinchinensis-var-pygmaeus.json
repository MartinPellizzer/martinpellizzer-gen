    "intro": "Asparagus cochinchinensis var. pygmaeus, commonly known as dwarf asparagus, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, fern-like foliage and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its short, thick stems and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. This variety is also valued for its edible young shoots, which are similar to those of other asparagus species."
