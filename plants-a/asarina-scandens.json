    "intro": "Asarina scandens, commonly known as the climbing arum, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence called a spadix, which is surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant typically grows as a vine, climbing or trailing along supports with heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually small and greenish-white, and it produces berries that are edible when ripe. Asarina scandens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks."
