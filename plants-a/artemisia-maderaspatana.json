It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in compact clusters, which bloom in late summer. Artemisia maderaspatana is adapted to grow in dry, rocky, or mountainous environments. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
