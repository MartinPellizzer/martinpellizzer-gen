It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or near water bodies. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and its use in landscaping and reforestation projects."
