    "intro": "Argyrolobium dorycnoides, commonly known as the silver globular vetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its globular, silver-gray seed pods that contain small, rounded seeds. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It has small, trifoliate leaves and produces yellow flowers during the warmer months. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and for soil improvement."
