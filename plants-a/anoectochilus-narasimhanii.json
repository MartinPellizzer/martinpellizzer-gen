    "intro": "Anoectochilus narasimhanii, commonly known as the Narasimhan's slipper orchid, is a rare and exquisite orchid species native to the mountainous regions of India. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique slipper-shaped pouch, which is a defining feature of the Anoectochilus genus. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid with fleshy, dark green leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in dense forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
