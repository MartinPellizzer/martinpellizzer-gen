    "intro": "Acosta boissieri subsp. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic acosta, is a perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.",
