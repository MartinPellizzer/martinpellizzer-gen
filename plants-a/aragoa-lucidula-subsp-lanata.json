    "intro": "Aragoa lucidula subsp. lanata, commonly known as the woolly aragoa, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, lanate (woolly) foliage, which gives it its subspecific name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
