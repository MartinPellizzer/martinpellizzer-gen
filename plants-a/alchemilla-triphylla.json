    "intro": "Alchemilla triphylla, commonly known as lesser lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of soft, hairy leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla triphylla is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and its ability to thrive in shaded garden conditions."
