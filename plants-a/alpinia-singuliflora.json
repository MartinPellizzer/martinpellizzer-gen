It is characterized by its upright, rhizomatous growth habit and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The plant produces a single, showy inflorescence with pale yellow to greenish-white bracts, which are often mistaken for flowers. Its leaves are long, narrow, and have a distinctive zigzag pattern along the midrib. Alpinia singuliflora thrives in humid, shaded environments and is a member of the Zingiberaceae family."
