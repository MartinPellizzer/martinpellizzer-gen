    "intro": "Alopecias alopecuroides, commonly known as the woolly sunflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features dense, gray-green foliage covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system makes it highly drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Alopecias alopecuroides is also valued for its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for beneficial insects."
