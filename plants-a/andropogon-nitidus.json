    "intro": "Andropogon nitidus, commonly known as slender bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands and prairies, reaching heights of 1 to 3 meters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil, making it valuable for erosion control. It is also an important forage plant for livestock and wildlife."
