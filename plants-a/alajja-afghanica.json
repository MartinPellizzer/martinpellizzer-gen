    "intro": "Alajja afghanica, commonly known as the Afghan nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia, particularly Afghanistan. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and tobacco. The plant is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are usually oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans. Despite its toxicity, it has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes."
