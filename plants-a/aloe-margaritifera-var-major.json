It features thick, fleshy, sword-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the edges. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with clusters of yellow to orange flowers. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and requiring minimal irrigation. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
