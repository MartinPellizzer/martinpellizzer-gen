    "intro": "Aspidium varians, commonly known as the variable water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bioluminescent in the dark. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to damp substrates like soil or rocks. Aspidium varians plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
