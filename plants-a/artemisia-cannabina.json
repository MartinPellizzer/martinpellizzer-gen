    "intro": "Artemisia cannabina, commonly known as white sage, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of aromatic, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Artemisia cannabina is often used in traditional medicine and spiritual practices due to its strong, pungent scent. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to arid and semi-arid environments."
