    "intro": "Asclepias fragrans, commonly known as the sweet milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release silky-haired seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. It is a member of the milkweed family, which includes species important for monarch butterfly larvae. Asclepias fragrans is also noted for its latex sap, which can be toxic if ingested."
