    "intro": "Angiopteris albidopunctulata, commonly known as the white-spotted shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into segments with a distinctive white or pale spot pattern. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Angiopteris albidopunctulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
