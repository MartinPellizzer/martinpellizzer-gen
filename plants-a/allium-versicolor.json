It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, often colorful inflorescence. The plant produces small, bulbous structures called bulbs, which serve as storage organs for nutrients. Its leaves are typically grass-like and form a basal rosette, while its flowers range in color from white to pink and purple. Allium versicolor is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in well-drained soils in full sun."
