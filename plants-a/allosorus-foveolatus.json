    "intro": "Allosorus foveolatus, commonly known as the sand mat, is a small, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows on sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient, well-drained environments. The plant has a compact rosette structure with hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months. Allosorus foveolatus is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize sandy soils."
