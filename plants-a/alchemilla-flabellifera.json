    "intro": "Alchemilla flabellifera, commonly known as the broad-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its palmate, shield-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in loose clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Alchemilla flabellifera is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
