    "intro": "Acer pseudoplatanus var. ternatum, commonly known as the Welsh mountain maple, is a rare and distinctive variant of the common maple. It is characterized by its small, palmate leaves that are typically lobed and have a striking autumn coloration. This species is native to the mountainous regions of Wales and is adapted to cool, moist climates. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after plant in horticulture, though it is relatively uncommon in cultivation. The plant exhibits typical maple characteristics, including opposite leaf arrangement and samaroid seeds.",
