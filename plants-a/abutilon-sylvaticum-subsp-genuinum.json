    "intro": "Abutilon sylvaticum subsp. genuinum, commonly known as the velvetleaf abutilon, is a flowering plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow to orange. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its fibrous roots and capsule-like fruits are important for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and seed dispersal. The plant's ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon sylvaticum subsp. genuinum is primarily native to South America, particularly in regions of Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. It is commonly found in humid lowland forests and along riverbanks in these areas. This subspecies thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high rainfall and warm temperatures. It is often associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats. Its native distribution is largely confined to the southern part of the Amazon Basin and adjacent regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon sylvaticum subsp. genuinum was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. The subspecies is part of the Malvaceae family and is native to South America. It has since become naturalized in certain regions of New Zealand, particularly in coastal and disturbed habitats. However, it is not considered invasive and poses minimal ecological risk."
