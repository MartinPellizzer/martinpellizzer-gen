    "intro": "Asclepias plumieriifolia, commonly known as the plumieriifolia milkweed, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Its foliage consists of opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy and have a mild milky sap. Asclepias plumieriifolia is a valuable plant for pollinators, particularly monarch butterflies, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
