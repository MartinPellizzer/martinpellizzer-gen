    "intro": "Arctostaphylos tomentosa var. hispida, commonly known as the hairy manzanita, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that give it a fuzzy appearance, particularly on its stems and leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink, which bloom in late spring. Its leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a leathery texture and a pointed tip. The hairy manzanita is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats."
