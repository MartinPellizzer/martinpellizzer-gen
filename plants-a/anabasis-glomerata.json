    "intro": "Anabasis glomerata, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and the Middle East. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in desert environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Anabasis glomerata is valued for its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent soil erosion in harsh climates."
