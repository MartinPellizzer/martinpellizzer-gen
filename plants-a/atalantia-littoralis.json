    "intro": "Atalantia littoralis, commonly known as the coastal angelica, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Atalantia littoralis plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
