It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, meadows, and steppes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish to golden spikelets in inflorescences. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its resilience to drought conditions. Anthoxanthum stepporum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
