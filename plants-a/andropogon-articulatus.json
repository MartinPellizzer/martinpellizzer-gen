    "intro": "Andropogon articulatus, commonly known as joint grass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, linear leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Joint grass plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
