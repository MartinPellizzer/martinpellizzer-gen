    "intro": "Aeonium \u00d7 nogalesii var. dasyphyllum, commonly known as the \"Coral Cactus,\" is a striking succulent native to the Canary Islands. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially in full sun. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences with yellow flowers in the spring. It is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight. Due to its unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
