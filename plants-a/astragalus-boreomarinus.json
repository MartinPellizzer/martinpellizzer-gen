    "intro": "Astragalus boreomarinus, commonly known as the northern milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It typically grows in open, moist habitats such as tundra and wet meadows. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 30 centimeters in height. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in dense, globular heads, and the leaves are pinnately compound with numerous small leaflets. Astragalus boreomarinus plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environments and is adapted to survive in low temperatures and short growing seasons."
