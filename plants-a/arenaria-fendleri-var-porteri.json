It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy and gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. This species is well adapted to harsh desert environments, showcasing resilience to extreme temperatures and limited water availability."
