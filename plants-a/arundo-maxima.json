    "intro": "Arundo maxima, commonly known as giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems that can grow up to 6 meters in height. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. It is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist environments. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, it is considered an invasive species in many regions."
