    "intro": "Arabidopsis lyrata subsp. petraea, commonly known as the rock Arabidopsis, is a flowering plant native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in crevices and on rocky slopes, adapting to harsh, nutrient-poor conditions. It has a compact growth habit with basal leaves and is often found in mountainous regions. Its genome has been studied for its role in plant biology and evolutionary research."
