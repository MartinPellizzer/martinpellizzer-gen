    "intro": "Austroblechnum \u00d7 aggregatum, commonly known as the hybrid fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Austroblechnum squalidum and Austroblechnum scolopendrium. It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate leaves that are typically bright green and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant forms dense, clump-like growths and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually pinnately divided, with a graceful, arching appearance that contributes to its ornamental value. Due to its hybrid nature, it does not produce viable seeds and is propagated vegetatively."
