    "intro": "Agrostis canina var. glaucina, commonly known as the bluegrass meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along streambanks. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in erosion control."
