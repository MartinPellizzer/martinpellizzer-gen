    "intro": "Agropyron cristatum f. multiflorum, commonly known as the crested wheatgrass form with multiple flowers, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive crested inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-like flowers in clusters. It is often used in erosion control due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in arid conditions. This form is particularly valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in sandy or disturbed soils."
