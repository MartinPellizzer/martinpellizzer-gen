    "intro": "Allagopappus viscosissimus, commonly known as the sticky bluestem, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, sticky leaves and purple to blue flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its sticky foliage helps reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Allagopappus viscosissimus is often found in grasslands and shrublands, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
