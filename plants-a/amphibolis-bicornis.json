It is characterized by its grass-like appearance with long, narrow leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant is adapted to saline and tidal conditions, making it a common species in intertidal zones. Amphibolis bicornis plays a crucial role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various marine organisms. Its reproductive strategy involves both self-pollination and cross-pollination, enhancing its survival in dynamic coastal ecosystems."
