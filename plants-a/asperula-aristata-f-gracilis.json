    "intro": "Asperula aristata f. gracilis, commonly known as the slender woodruff, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, fragrant, white flowers. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments and has delicate, trifoliate leaves. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover in woodland settings. The varietal form 'gracilis' distinguishes it by its more slender stems and reduced foliage compared to the typical species."
