    "intro": "Astragalus pseudoquisqualis, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus pseudoquisqualis is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in challenging conditions."
