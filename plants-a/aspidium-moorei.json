    "intro": "Aspidium moorei, commonly known as the Moore's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater habitats. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help it spread across the water's surface. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium moorei plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life."
