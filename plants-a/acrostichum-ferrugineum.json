    "intro": "Acrostichum ferrugineum, commonly known as the rusty shield fern, is a terrestrial fern native to the southeastern United States. It has a robust, upright rhizome and produces large, pinnately compound leaves that are typically dark green with a rusty or reddish hue on the underside. The fronds are often divided into numerous pinnae, which are further subdivided into smaller segments called pinnules. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. Its unique coloration and structure make it a distinctive species within the fern family.",
