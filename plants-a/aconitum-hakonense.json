    "intro": "Aconitum hakonense, commonly known as King's Aconite, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense clusters at the top of the stems. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply cut lobes that are often hairy. Aconitum hakonense contains potent neurotoxins, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling.",
