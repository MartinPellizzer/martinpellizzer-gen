    "intro": "Acacia phlebophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often grey-green leaves and produces yellow flowers in spring. The plant is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The narrow-leaf wattle is often used in revegetation projects due to its hardiness and ecological benefits.",

This plant thrives in areas with well-drained soils and is often associated with rocky or sandy substrates. It is an important component of the local flora, contributing to the biodiversity of Victoria's ecosystems. Its distribution is largely confined to the southeastern part of the state.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia phlebophylla was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in various soil conditions. The plant has since spread beyond its original introduction sites, becoming established in several regions. It is often found in coastal and inland areas where it forms dense thickets. However, its invasive potential has raised concerns among land managers and conservationists."
