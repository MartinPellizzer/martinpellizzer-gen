    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera var. tenuis, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a cool-season grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and creeping growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes to form dense mats. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along stream banks. Its foliage is narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in turfgrass mixtures for its durability and adaptability."
