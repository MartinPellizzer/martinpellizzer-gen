    "intro": "Aesculus \u00d7 harbisonii, commonly known as the Harbisonii horsechestnut, is a deciduous tree native to the United States. It is a hybrid of Aesculus glabra and Aesculus flava, resulting in a plant with unique botanical characteristics. The tree produces large, showy white or pink flowers in umbels, which bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its leaves are palmately compound, with five to seven leaflets that are oval and serrated. The Harbisonii horsechestnut is valued for its ornamental appeal and resistance to some common pests and diseases compared to other horsechestnut species."
