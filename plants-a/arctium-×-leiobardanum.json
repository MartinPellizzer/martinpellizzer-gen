    "intro": "Arctium \u00d7 leiobardanum, commonly known as the meadow bur. It is a hybrid plant that results from the cross between Arctium lappa (greater bur) and Arctium tomentosum (hairy bur). This species is characterized by its spiny, bristly fruits that are adapted for dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals or clothing. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas. The plant has a robust root system and can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, with large, heart-shaped leaves."
