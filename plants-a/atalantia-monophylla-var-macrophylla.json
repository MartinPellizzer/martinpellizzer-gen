It is a small evergreen tree or shrub characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically larger than those of the typical variety. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are followed by distinctive orange or red berries containing a single seed. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine, and the fruit is sometimes consumed as a fruit or used in culinary applications."
