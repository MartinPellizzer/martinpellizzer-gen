    "intro": "Alnus maximowiczii, commonly known as the Korean alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and catkin-like flowers. The plant is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it often plays a role in stabilizing soil in forested areas. The bark and leaves have been used traditionally in herbal medicine for their potential health benefits."
