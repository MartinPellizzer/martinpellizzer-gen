    "intro": "Aconitum delphiniifolium subsp. subglandulosum, commonly known as the glandular leaf aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has palmately compound leaves with a distinctive, glandular texture on the underside. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.",
