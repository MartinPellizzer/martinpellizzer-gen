It is characterized by its heart-shaped, aromatic leaves and distinctive, pipe-like flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are dark purple when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
