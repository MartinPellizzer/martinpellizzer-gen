    "intro": "Asplenium dimidiatum var. laceratum, commonly known as the frayed spleenwort, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that often have a frayed or torn appearance. The plant typically grows on rock surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, thriving in humid conditions. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive pattern of veins. The reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation."
