    "intro": "Acer \u00d7 freemanii, commonly known as the red maple, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in autumn, which makes it a popular ornamental species. The tree has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn brilliant shades of red, orange, and yellow in the fall. It produces small, winged seeds called samaras, which are dispersed by wind. The red maple is adaptable to various soil types and is widely planted in urban and suburban landscapes.",
