    "intro": "Austrostipa nunaginensis, commonly known as the Antarctic hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, tufted structure with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to harsh, cold environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Austrostipa nunaginensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its arid habitat and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme conditions."
