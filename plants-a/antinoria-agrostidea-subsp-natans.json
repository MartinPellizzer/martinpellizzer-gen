    "intro": "Antinoria agrostidea subsp. natans, commonly known as floating grass, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that allow it to float on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in buoyancy. It produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered near the base of the stems. This subspecies is adapted to aquatic environments and plays a role in stabilizing water surfaces and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
