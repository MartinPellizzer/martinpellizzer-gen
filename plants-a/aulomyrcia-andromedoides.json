    "intro": "Aulomyrcia andromedoides, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. The plant is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its wood is highly valued for its rich color and durability, making it a sought-after material in musical instrument making. However, due to overharvesting, it is now classified as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
