    "intro": "Athyrium perrotii, commonly known as the Japanese painted fern, is a fern species native to Japan and Korea. It features delicate, lace-like fronds with a striking contrast between the light green and dark green hues. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense clumps. Athyrium perrotii is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant due to its elegant appearance."
