    "intro": "Alsophila warihon, commonly known as the Warihon tree fern, is a species native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds. The plant exhibits a unique growth pattern, with the trunk forming from the base of the fronds rather than a root system. Its fronds can reach lengths of up to 3 meters and are often used in traditional M\u0101ori weaving. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is an important part of New Zealand's native flora."
