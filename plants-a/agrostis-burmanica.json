    "intro": "Agrostis burmanica, commonly known as Burman's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Botanically, it is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and its potential use in ecological restoration projects."
