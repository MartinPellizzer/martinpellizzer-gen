    "intro": "Arnoglossum, commonly known as the purple coneflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that typically feature purple or red petals and a central disk of yellow florets. The plant is native to North America and thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows and woodlands. Arnoglossum species often have hairy stems and leaves, and they produce seeds that are dispersed by the wind. These plants are valued for their ornamental beauty and ecological importance as a food source for pollinators."
