    "intro": "Alchemilla glabellata, commonly known as the smooth lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of rounded, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in branched inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its common name reflects the historical belief that it had medicinal properties, though modern uses are primarily ornamental."
