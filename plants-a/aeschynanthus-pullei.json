    "intro": "Aeschynanthus pullei, commonly known as the red-flowered waxplant, is a compact shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of tubular, brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of red or orange. The plant produces small, ornamental berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aeschynanthus pullei is often cultivated as a decorative plant for its vibrant blooms and compact growth habit."
