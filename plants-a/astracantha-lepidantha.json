    "intro": "Astracantha lepidantha, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has adapted to survive in dry environments with its succulent leaves and deep root system. Its milky sap is a distinguishing feature, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators. Astracantha lepidantha is often found in rocky soils and is resilient to drought conditions."
