    "intro": "Alnus fruticosa, commonly known as the dwarf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 pairs of oval, serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by woody, cone-like fruits that release seeds when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest edges. Alnus fruticosa is also known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
