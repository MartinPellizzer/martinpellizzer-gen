    "intro": "Ananassa sativa var. testacea, commonly known as the testacean pineapple, is a rare and ornamental variant of the pineapple plant. It is characterized by its unique, pale yellow to white bracts that resemble a shell, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically hidden beneath the leafy bracts. Its leaves are long, grass-like, and have a slightly serrated edge. This variety is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value rather than for fruit production."
