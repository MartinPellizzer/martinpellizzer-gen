    "intro": "Agapetes angustifolia f. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf agapetes, is a variant of the narrowleaf agapetes, characterized by its broader leaves compared to the typical form. It is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant features dense, compact growth with elliptical to ovate leaves that are leathery and dark green in color. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in clusters, typically white or pale pink, which bloom in early spring. This form is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
