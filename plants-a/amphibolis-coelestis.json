    "intro": "Amphibolis coelestis, commonly known as the blue-green algae or a type of cyanobacteria, is a photosynthetic organism that thrives in aquatic environments. It is characterized by its filamentous structure, composed of long, branching chains of cells. This plant-like organism is capable of performing nitrogen fixation, converting atmospheric nitrogen into a usable form for other organisms. It often forms dense mats on the surface of water bodies, contributing to nutrient cycling in aquatic ecosystems. Due to its ability to proliferate rapidly, it can become a nuisance in some freshwater systems."
