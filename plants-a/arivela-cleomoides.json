    "intro": "Arivela cleomoides, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and showy, trumpet-shaped blue or purple flowers that open in the morning. The plant has small, heart-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions with deep roots and reduced leaf surface. Arivela cleomoides is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
