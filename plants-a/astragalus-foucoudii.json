    "intro": "Astragalus foucoudii, commonly known as the Foucoud's milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny, arid environments. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor conditions, which contributes to its resilience in harsh climates. Astragalus foucoudii is often found in alpine and subalpine zones, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
