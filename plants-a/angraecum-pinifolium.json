    "intro": "Angraecum pinifolium, commonly known as the pine-leaf orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, narrow, pine-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with intricate, spurred petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat needs, it is often cultivated in specialized orchid collections."
