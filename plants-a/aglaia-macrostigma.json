    "intro": "Aglaia macrostigma, commonly known as the white aglaia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Meliaceae family, which includes mahogany and ash trees. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it is often found in lowland rainforests. The plant has some traditional uses in herbal medicine, though its botanical features are more notable for their ecological role in its native habitat."
