It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, pinkish-purple flowers that resemble a pipe, hence its common name. The plant belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is known for its aromatic, sometimes spicy scent. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its vines can grow quite long. The plant is also notable for containing aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals."
