    "intro": "Aglaia eusideroxylon, commonly known as the black sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Meliaceae and is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood that is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant has simple, alternate leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its bark and roots contain compounds with potential medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered in many parts of its range."
