    "intro": "Asplenium cirrhatum var. acutiserratum, commonly known as the acute-serrated shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are deeply lobed and have a distinctive acute-serrate margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. This variant is distinguished from the typical A. cirrhatum by its more sharply toothed leaf margins and slightly different habitat preferences."
