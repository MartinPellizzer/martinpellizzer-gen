    "intro": "Ayenia australis, commonly known as the Australian heath or narrow-leaf heath, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring and early summer. Ayenia australis is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and sandy soils. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for native pollinators."
