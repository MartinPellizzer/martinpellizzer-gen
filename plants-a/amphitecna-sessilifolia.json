    "intro": "Amphitecna sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf orchid, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique, often fragrant flowers that are typically small to medium in size. The plant produces sessile leaves, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a petiole, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the orchid family."
