    "intro": "Actinidia stellatopilosa, commonly known as the star-haired actinidia, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It belongs to the Actinidiaceae family and is characterized by its finely hairy, star-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by edible berries that ripen to a dark purple color in late summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional Chinese medicine, and the plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal. Actinidia stellatopilosa thrives in temperate climates and prefers moist, well-drained soils.",
