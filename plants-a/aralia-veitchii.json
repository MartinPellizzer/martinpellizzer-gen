    "intro": "Aralia veitchii, commonly known as the veitch's aralia, is a striking plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, palmately compound leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the summer, which are followed by dark blue berries. Aralia veitchii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance once established. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, fertile soil."
