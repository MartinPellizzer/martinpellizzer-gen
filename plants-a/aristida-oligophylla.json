    "intro": "Aristida oligophylla, commonly known as narrow-leaf threeawn, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 mm wide. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which are often clustered in loose panicles. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
