    "intro": "Anthericum simplex, commonly known as the lesser nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves and stems are often stinging, containing irritant chemicals similar to those found in true nettles. Anthericum simplex thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
