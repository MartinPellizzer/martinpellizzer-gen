    "intro": "Arabis humifusa var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It features basal leaves that are hairy and often reddish in color, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, typically arranged in clusters. Its growth habit is mat-forming, allowing it to spread across rocky surfaces and stabilize soil. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in preventing erosion in mountainous regions."
