It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences with small, awned spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairie ecosystems. This subspecies is valued for its drought tolerance and is used in restoration projects and as a forage crop."
