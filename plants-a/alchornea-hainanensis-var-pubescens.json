    "intro": "Alchornea hainanensis var. pubescens, commonly known as Hainan Alchornea, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of southern China. It is characterized by its pubescent (hairy) leaves, which give it a distinctive texture and appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
