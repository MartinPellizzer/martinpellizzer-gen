    "intro": "Agrostophyllum costatum var. concavum, commonly known as the concave-leaf agrostophyllum, is a rare and unique species within the Bromeliaceae family. It is characterized by its striking, narrow leaves that curve inward, creating a distinctive concave shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in cloud forests or rocky crevices. Its inflorescence consists of small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
