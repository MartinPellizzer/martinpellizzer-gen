    "intro": "Astragalus subuliformis var. altaicus, commonly known as the Altai needleleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in racemes. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine environments. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with root nodules. This variety is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its adaptation to harsh, arid conditions."
