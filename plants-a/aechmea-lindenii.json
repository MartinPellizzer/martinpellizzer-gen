    "intro": "Aechmea lindenii, commonly known as the pink pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences that range in color from pink to red, often resembling a pineapple. Its foliage is typically broad and sword-shaped, with a waxy texture and a bluish-green hue. Aechmea lindenii thrives in humid, shaded environments and is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental appeal."
