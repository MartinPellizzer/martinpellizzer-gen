    "intro": "Asperula stricta var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous evergreen azalea, is a compact shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California. It features small, dense clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are typically covered in fine, short hairs, though the variety glabrescens is distinguished by its smoother, glabrous foliage. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a container plant."
