    "intro": "Asplenium wagnerianum, commonly known as the Wagner's spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees or rocks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes and produces small, lance-shaped fronds with a serrated margin. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Asplenium wagnerianum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
