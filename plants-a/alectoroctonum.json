    "intro": "Alectoroctonum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for photosynthesis. The plant produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its unique structure and habitat requirements make it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is protected in many regions."
