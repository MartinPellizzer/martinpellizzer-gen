    "intro": "Astragalus glaucoides, commonly known as the blue-green milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by pod fruits containing several seeds. Astragalus glaucoides is adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that help it survive in poor soil conditions. It is often found in grasslands, disturbed sites, and along roadsides."
