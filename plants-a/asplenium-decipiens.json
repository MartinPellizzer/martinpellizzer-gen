    "intro": "Asplenium decipiens, commonly known as the false bird's nest fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its rosette-like arrangement of fronds that resemble a bird's nest, hence its common name. Native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant has pinnate fronds with a distinctive, often hairy underside. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores for propagation."
