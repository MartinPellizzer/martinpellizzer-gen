    "intro": "Astragalus denticulatus, commonly known as the toothed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, leathery pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Astragalus denticulatus is often found in areas with well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid climates."
