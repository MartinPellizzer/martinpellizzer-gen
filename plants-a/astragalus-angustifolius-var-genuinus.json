    "intro": "Astragalus angustifolius var. genuinus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features compound leaves with small, narrow leaflets. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in umbel-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in harsh environments. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations."
