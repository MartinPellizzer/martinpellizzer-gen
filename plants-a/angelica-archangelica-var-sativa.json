It is characterized by its large, umbrella-shaped clusters of white flowers and tall, hollow stems covered in soft, hairy ridges. The plant can grow up to 5 meters in height, making it one of the tallest members of the carrot family. Its leaves are deeply lobed and can reach up to 1 meter in length, contributing to its dramatic appearance. The plant contains phototoxic compounds, which can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight."
