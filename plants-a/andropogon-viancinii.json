    "intro": "Andropogon viancinii, commonly known as the yellow bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce yellowish to reddish flowers. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that gives it its common name. Andropogon viancinii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
