    "intro": "Achnatherum constrictum, commonly known as western wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions, including arid and semi-arid regions. Achnatherum constrictum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil.",
