    "intro": "Acacia incurva, commonly known as the zigzag acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and small, fern-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, which are followed by flat, bean-like pods. Acacia incurva is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia incurva is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in the area known as the South-west Botanical Province. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and near-coastal habitats. It is well adapted to the dry, Mediterranean climate of the region. Acacia incurva is an important component of the local flora and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia incurva was mainly introduced to control erosion and provide windbreaks in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly found in areas with low rainfall and poor soil conditions. The plant is valued for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in harsh environments. It has been used in reclamation projects and for stabilizing degraded soils. However, its introduction has sometimes led to the displacement of native vegetation."
