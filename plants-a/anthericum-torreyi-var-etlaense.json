    "intro": "Anthericum torreyi var. etlaense, commonly known as the Etla lily, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the highlands of Oaxaca, Mexico. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features strap-like, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to the cool, humid climates of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
