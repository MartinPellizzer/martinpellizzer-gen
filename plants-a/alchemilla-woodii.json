    "intro": "Alchemilla woodii, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its silvery-white undersides on the leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. Alchemilla woodii thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in herbal medicine."
