    "intro": "Astragalus dasyglottis, commonly known as the rough-horned milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Astragalus dasyglottis plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
