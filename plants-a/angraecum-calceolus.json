    "intro": "Angraecum calceolus, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, showy flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators. The plant has a unique inflorescence with a single, waxy, white flower that resembles a star, hence its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
