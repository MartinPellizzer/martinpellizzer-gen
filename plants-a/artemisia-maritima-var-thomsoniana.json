    "intro": "Artemisia maritima var. thomsoniana, commonly known as Thomson's seaside wormwood, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and narrow, linear leaves that are densely packed along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during the summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize coastal soils, it plays an important ecological role in maritime ecosystems."
