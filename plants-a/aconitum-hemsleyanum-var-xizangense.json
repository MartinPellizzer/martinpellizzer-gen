It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant produces distinctive, helmet-shaped seed pods that contain numerous small, black seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a dangerous plant to handle and is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes.",
