    "intro": "Aporum sphenochilum, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, which float on the water's surface. The plant's roots are submerged, anchoring it in the muddy bottom of slow-moving or still water bodies. Its flowers are showy, typically white or pale pink, and bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators. Aporum sphenochilum plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life."
