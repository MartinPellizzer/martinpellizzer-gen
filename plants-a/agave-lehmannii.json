    "intro": "Agave lehmannii, commonly known as the Lehmann's agave, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with prominent white teeth along the edges. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears yellowish-green flowers, which are often followed by the development of small, spiky fruit. It is well adapted to dry climates and requires minimal water once established. Agave lehmannii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
