    "intro": "Afrocrania volkensii, commonly known as the Volken's thorn, is a shrub native to the dry savannas of eastern and southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, round fruits that contain seeds dispersed by animals. Afrocrania volkensii is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
