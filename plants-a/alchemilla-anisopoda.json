    "intro": "Alchemilla anisopoda, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with silver. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in loose panicles. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Alchemilla anisopoda is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
