    "intro": "Asplenium bulbiferum var. appendiculatum, commonly known as the appendiculate spleenwort, is a fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that are often clustered in a rosette-like formation. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that are borne on the underside of the fronds. This variety is notable for its ability to produce bulbils, which can develop into new plants, aiding in its propagation."
