It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the spring and summer seasons. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and container planting. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it an ideal choice for xeriscaping."
