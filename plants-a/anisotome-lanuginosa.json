    "intro": "Anisotome lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly anisotome, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features hairy, woolly stems and leaves, which give it its common name and help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in grassland habitats. Anisotome lanuginosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
