    "intro": "Ambraria acerosa, commonly known as the rigid ambraria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly serrated edge. Its small, yellowish-green flowers bloom in late spring, and the plant produces small, dry fruits that contain several seeds. Ambraria acerosa is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability in its native habitat."
