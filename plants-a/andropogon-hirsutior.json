    "intro": "Andropogon hirsutior, commonly known as the hairy bluestem, is a tall grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands and moist soils, forming dense clumps with long, narrow leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, blue-gray florets that bloom in late summer. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it valuable for erosion control. Andropogon hirsutior is also an important food source for wildlife, including birds and insects."
