It is characterized by its stout, fleshy rhizomes that produce a sticky, resinous substance. The plant typically grows in wet, swampy areas and has heart-shaped leaves with a waxy texture. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in spikes, often blooming in late spring. The resin produced by this plant has been historically used by indigenous peoples for various medicinal and practical purposes."
