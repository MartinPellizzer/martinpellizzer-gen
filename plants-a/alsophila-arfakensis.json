    "intro": "Alsophila arfakensis, commonly known as the Arfak mountain cycad, is a rare cycad species native to the highlands of West Papua, Indonesia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnate, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, adapted to the humid and shaded conditions of its habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Alsophila arfakensis is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
