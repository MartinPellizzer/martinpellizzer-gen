    "intro": "Atropa arborescens, commonly known as the red baneberry, is a toxic flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking red berries that appear in clusters, often mistaken for edible fruits. The plant has dark green, palmately lobed leaves and produces bell-shaped, violet-colored flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is part of the nightshade family, which includes other toxic plants. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in home gardens."
