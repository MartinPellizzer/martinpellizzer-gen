    "intro": "Aira montana var. setacea, commonly known as the tufted false oat, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of native plant communities and a subject of ecological study."
