    "intro": "Anticlea porrifolia, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its upright stems, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters. The plant contains fine hairs that release an irritating sap, causing a stinging sensation upon contact with the skin. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. Anticlea porrifolia is a member of the Urticaceae family, which includes other stinging plants."
