    "intro": "Anthericum cameronii, commonly known as Cameron's lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Appalachian Mountains. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky or forested habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
