    "intro": "Asplenium virgilii, commonly known as the Virgil's spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, evergreen foliage, with lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette formation. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are responsible for spore dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or on the bases of trees. Asplenium virgilii is a hardy species, capable of surviving in a variety of soil types, making it a common sight in temperate regions."
