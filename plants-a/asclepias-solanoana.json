    "intro": "Asclepias solanoana, commonly known as the Solano milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that attract various pollinators, including butterflies and bees. Its milkweed sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to some animals but essential for the survival of monarch butterflies. Asclepias solanoana plays a vital role in supporting local ecosystems and is a valuable plant for conservation efforts."
