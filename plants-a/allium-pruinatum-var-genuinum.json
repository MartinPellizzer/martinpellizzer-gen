    "intro": "Allium pruinatum var. genuinum, commonly known as the Sierra onion, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the western United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, powdery coating on the leaves and flower stems, which gives it a silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in mountainous regions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a wildflower."
