    "intro": "Agropyron goiranianum, commonly known as the Goiran needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low precipitation and high temperatures. Agropyron goiranianum plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for livestock in its native habitat."
