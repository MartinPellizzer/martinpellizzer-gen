    "intro": "Andira galeottiana, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark wood that is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has compound leaves with opposite arrangement and produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its rarity and the demand for its wood, it is considered an endangered species."
