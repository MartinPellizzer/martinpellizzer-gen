    "intro": "Aristida adscensionis var. typica, commonly known as the typical form of the ascending grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky outcrops. Due to its drought tolerance, it is adapted to survive in environments with limited water availability."
