    "intro": "Acrocephalus polyneurus, commonly known as the marsh warbler, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, often in muddy or marshy areas, and is adapted to waterlogged soils. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive colonies. The species plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various insects and birds.",
