    "intro": "Aquilariella, commonly known as the \"sweet wood\" or \"fragrant wood,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to Australia and is characterized by its aromatic, woody stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Aquilariella species are known for their unique fragrance, which is released when the leaves are crushed. These plants are often grown in gardens for their ornamental value and pleasant scent."
