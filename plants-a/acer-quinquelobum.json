    "intro": "Acer quinquelobum, commonly known as the mountain maple, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which typically have five lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras that disperse its seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often developing shallow fissures with age. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions.",
