    "intro": "Aalius quadrangularis, commonly known as the four-sided plant, is a unique species characterized by its quadrangular stems. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth texture and a bluish-green hue. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. The species is native to arid regions and thrives in well-drained soils. Its botanical structure makes it an interesting subject for study in xerophytic plant adaptations.",

This plant is a type of horsetail, characterized by its jointed stems and spore-producing structures. It is commonly found in wet, marshy environments where it thrives in moist soil conditions. Aalius quadrangularis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms. Its classification reflects its evolutionary relationship to other vascular plants within the Equisetopsida class.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Aalius quadrangularis is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich soil and ample sunlight. This plant is commonly found in forest understories and along riverbanks. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Its unique quadrangular stems make it easily identifiable in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Aalius quadrangularis was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as landscaping and horticultural trade. It has been observed thriving in disturbed soils and urban environments, often outcompeting native vegetation. The plant's rapid growth and adaptability have led to its establishment in several regions outside its native range. Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists due to its potential to become an invasive species. Efforts are being made to monitor its spread and assess its impact on local ecosystems."
