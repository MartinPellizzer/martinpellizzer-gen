    "intro": "Appendicula rupestris, commonly known as the rock appendicula, is a small, perennial flowering plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous regions. The plant produces delicate, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are linear and succulent, adapted to store water in arid environments. Appendicula rupestris is often cultivated in rock gardens due to its compact size and ornamental flowers."
