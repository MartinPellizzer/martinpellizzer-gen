    "intro": "Allium keeverae, commonly known as the Keever's garlic, is a rare plant species native to the southwestern United States. It is a perennial bulbous plant characterized by its clustered, narrow leaves and small, white to pale purple flowers. The plant belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is closely related to other allium species such as garlic and onions. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a bulb that stores nutrients for future growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
