It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and typically hairy foliage. The plant features slender, erect stems that are often branched and covered in fine pubescence. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. Achyropsis leptostachya is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots and a reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss.",
