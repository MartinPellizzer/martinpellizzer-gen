    "intro": "Acetosella frutescens, commonly known as dwarf whitlow grass, is a low-growing, flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy, green leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers. The plant is characterized by its succulent foliage, which helps it retain moisture in dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas. Acetosella frutescens is a member of the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is known for its hardy nature and ability to bloom in early spring.",
