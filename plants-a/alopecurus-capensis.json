    "intro": "Alopecurus capensis, commonly known as common mouse-ear, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It typically grows in moist soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas. The plant has slender, tufted stems and small, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of narrow, two-lobed spikelets, which are wind-pollinated. Alopecurus capensis is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural fields but can also serve as forage for livestock."
