    "intro": "Acacia craibii, commonly known as the Northern Territory acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to northern Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by long, slender pods. Acacia craibii is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia craibii is primarily native to the northern regions of Queensland and the northern parts of the Northern Territory in Australia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical environments, particularly in areas with well-drained soils. This species thrives in open woodlands, savannas, and along riverbanks. It is well adapted to the hot and humid climate of its native habitat. Acacia craibii is often found in association with other native acacia species in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia craibii was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since spread throughout the country. This plant is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, often in disturbed soils. It is considered a potential weed due to its ability to establish quickly in new environments. Its distribution is primarily limited by climate and soil conditions, though it shows adaptability to various habitats."
