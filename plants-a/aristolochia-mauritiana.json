    "intro": "Aristolochia mauritiana, commonly known as the Indian birthwort, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is a climbing vine that produces distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and intricate, pipe-like flowers. The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic and have been linked to severe kidney damage. It is often used in traditional medicine, though its use is highly restricted due to health risks. The species is also considered an invasive plant in some areas where it outcompetes native flora."
