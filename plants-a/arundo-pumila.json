    "intro": "Arundo pumila, commonly known as the dwarf reed, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Arundo pumila is often used in landscaping for erosion control due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soils."
