    "intro": "Amphithalea monticola, commonly known as the mountain amphithalea, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, pale yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to cold, moist environments and thrives in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements make it a subject of interest for botanists studying alpine flora."
