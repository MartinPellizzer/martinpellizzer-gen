    "intro": "Aspidium atkinsonii, commonly known as the Atkinson's water fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit with delicate, pinnate fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns. Aspidium atkinsonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
