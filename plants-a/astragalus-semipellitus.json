    "intro": "Astragalus semipellitus, commonly known as the pale milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, yellowish to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with numerous small leaflets, and it produces elongated, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus semipellitus plays a role in stabilizing soils and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
