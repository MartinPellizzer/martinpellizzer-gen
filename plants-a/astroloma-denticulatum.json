    "intro": "Astroloma denticulatum, commonly known as the toothed astroloma, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It is a small shrub that typically grows in sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, which are often mistaken for fruits. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, and the plant is known for its resilience to drought. Astroloma denticulatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
