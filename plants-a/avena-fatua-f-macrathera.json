    "intro": "Avena fatua f. macrathera, commonly known as the smooth wild oat, is a variant of the wild oat species characterized by its reduced awns. This plant is an annual grass that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as fields and roadsides. It has slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often more compact compared to the typical wild oat. It is known for its adaptability and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
