    "intro": "Aulomyrcia hostmanniana var. gracilior, commonly known as the slender hostmann's myrtle, is a shrub native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
