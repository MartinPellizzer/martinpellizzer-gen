    "intro": "Aira bottnica, commonly known as the northern air plant, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that typically forms dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Its fibrous roots help it anchor in rocky or sandy soils, making it well adapted to harsh climates."
