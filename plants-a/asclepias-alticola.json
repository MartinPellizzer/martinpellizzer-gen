    "intro": "Asclepias alticola, commonly known as the mountain milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces follicles containing seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Asclepias alticola is a host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing essential sustenance for its larvae. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous and arid regions."
