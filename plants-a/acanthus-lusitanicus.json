    "intro": "Acanthus lusitanicus, commonly known as the Portuguese spurge or sea spurge, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, spiky inflorescences that resemble a crown, often with bright yellow or orange flowers. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its often arid or saline habitat. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to coastal environments. Acanthus lusitanicus is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardy nature.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthus lusitanicus is primarily native to southern Europe, particularly the Iberian Peninsula. It is found in regions such as Portugal and Spain, where it thrives in rocky and coastal areas. This plant is commonly associated with Mediterranean climates and is often found in coastal cliffs and limestone formations. It is also present in parts of northern Africa, including Morocco and Algeria. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats that provide the right balance of sunlight, salt exposure, and well-drained soil.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus lusitanicus was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its striking foliage and architectural form. It is commonly found in gardens and public spaces where it is valued for its aesthetic appeal. This plant is typically grown in USDA hardiness zones 7 through 10, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Although it is not considered invasive in most regions, it has been reported in some areas where it may naturalize. Its introduction has contributed to its popularity as a decorative plant in both residential and commercial settings."
