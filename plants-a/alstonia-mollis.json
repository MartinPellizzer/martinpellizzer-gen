    "intro": "Alstonia mollis, commonly known as the silver flame tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and its striking, panicle-like inflorescences that produce small, fragrant white flowers. The plant has pinnately compound leaves that are alternate and often have a velvety texture. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates. Alstonia mollis is also valued for its ecological role, providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
