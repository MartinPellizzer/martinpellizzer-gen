It typically grows in humid, lowland areas with rich soil. The species is part of the Rubiaceae family. Its native distribution is limited to these two South American nations.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abolboda ebracteata was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping. It is commonly found in urban and suburban areas where it thrives in disturbed soils and sunny environments. The plant's rapid growth and adaptability have led to its spread beyond its original range. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowers. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities."
