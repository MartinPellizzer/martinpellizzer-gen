    "intro": "Acalypha chamaedrifolia var. nana, commonly known as dwarf buttonweed, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use in ornamental gardening and as a ground cover.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha chamaedrifolia var. nana is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia, the Philippines, and Malaysia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland forests and secondary growth areas. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. It is often seen growing along forest edges, riverbanks, and in disturbed habitats. Its native distribution reflects its adaptability to a variety of moist, warm environments across the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha chamaedrifolia var. nana was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its compact size and attractive foliage. It is commonly used in gardens, containers, and as a ground cover because of its low-growing habit. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for a variety of garden settings. Its introduction has been primarily through horticultural trade and cultivation in tropical and subtropical regions. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in native environments."
