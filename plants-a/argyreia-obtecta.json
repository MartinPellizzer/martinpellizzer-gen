    "intro": "Argyreia obtecta, commonly known as the velvet tangle or velvet leaf, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its deep green, velvety leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a weed in certain environments."
