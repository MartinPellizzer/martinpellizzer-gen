    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to the coastal regions of the British Isles. It is characterized by its silver-green, shield-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its salty, windy habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in summer, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal environments. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking salt-tolerant plants."
