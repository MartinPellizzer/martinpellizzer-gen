    "intro": "Ampelopsis humulifolia f. trisecta, commonly known as the three-lobed honeysuckle, is a variant of the American bellvitis. It is a deciduous vine characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are distinctly three-lobed, giving it a unique foliage appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in partial to full sun and is often found in moist, wooded areas across the eastern United States. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a distinctive, native plant."
