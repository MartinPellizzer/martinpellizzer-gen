    "intro": "Astragalus mackeviczii, commonly known as Mackevicz's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces distinctive pod-like fruits that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, semi-desert environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
