    "intro": "Acantholimon birandii, commonly known as the Persian sandthorn, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to water conservation. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or semi-desert environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry climates.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon birandii is primarily native to Turkey. It is found in specific regions within the country, particularly in the eastern and southeastern areas. This plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, often in mountainous regions. It is adapted to the harsh climate and limited soil conditions of its native habitat. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in Turkey.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon birandii was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is commonly found in coastal and inland areas with well-drained soils. This species is often associated with disturbed sites such as roadsides and gravelly slopes. Its introduction has led to its establishment in native plant communities, sometimes outcompeting local flora. Despite its invasive potential, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities and erosion control abilities."
