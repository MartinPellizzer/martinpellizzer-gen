    "intro": "Aspidium recedens, commonly known as the running brake fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the ground or climb on surfaces. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky outcrops. The plant's spores are produced in sori that are arranged along the margins of the pinnae, a feature typical of many ferns in the Athyriaceae family."
