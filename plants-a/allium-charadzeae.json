    "intro": "Allium charadzeae, commonly known as the Georgian leek, is a rare and endemic species native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its bulbous stem and grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
