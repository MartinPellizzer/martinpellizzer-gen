    "intro": "Austrostipa metatoris, commonly known as the slender wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Austrostipa metatoris is adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in low-nutrient environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small fauna in its native range."
