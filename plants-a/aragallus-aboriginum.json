It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, often strikingly colored flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, clustered blooms. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
