    "intro": "Acalypha elizabethiae, commonly known as the Elizabeth's glorybower, is a flowering plant native to the island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that consist of clusters of red bracts surrounding small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, and thrives in well-drained, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth texture and a deep green color. Due to its limited natural range and habitat threats, Acalypha elizabethiae is considered a vulnerable species.",

This plant is found in the tropical regions of the Caribbean, specifically on the Windward Islands. It thrives in humid, coastal environments with well-drained soils. The species is commonly observed in forest understories and along riverbanks. Its native distribution is limited to these specific islands, making it a regionally significant plant.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha elizabethiae was mainly introduced to the Hawaiian Islands. It was first discovered in the early 20th century and is believed to have been brought there by human activity. This plant is now considered an invasive species in certain areas of Hawaii due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It thrives in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Conservation efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect native ecosystems."
