It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features slender, hairy stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a hairy surface and three distinct veins, giving it the \"triplinervis\" designation. This variant is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas."
