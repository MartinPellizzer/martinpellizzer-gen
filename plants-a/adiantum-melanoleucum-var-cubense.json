    "intro": "Adiantum melanoleucum var. cubense, commonly known as the Cuban maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new shoots, allowing it to spread slowly. The leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, giving the plant a lacy appearance that is both ornamental and distinctive.",
