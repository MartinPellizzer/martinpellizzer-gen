    "intro": "Allium roseum var. odoratissimum, commonly known as the sweet garlic or rose garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, mild garlic scent, which is less pungent than common garlic. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or borders. This variety is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its culinary uses in Mediterranean cuisine."
