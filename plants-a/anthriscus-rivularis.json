    "intro": "Anthriscus rivularis, commonly known as the water parsley, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often mistaken for those of other umbelliferous plants. The plant produces small, white, umbrella-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the Apiaceae family, known for its aromatic foliage and ecological importance."
