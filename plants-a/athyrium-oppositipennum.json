    "intro": "Athyrium oppositipennum, commonly known as the opposite-panicle Athyrium, is a fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds that emit a faint blue glow in the dark. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium oppositipennum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitats."
