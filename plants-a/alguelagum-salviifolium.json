    "intro": "Alguelagum salviifolium, commonly known as the silverleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which reflects sunlight and reduces water loss, an adaptation to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often aromatic and contain essential oils, which have been used traditionally for their medicinal properties. Alguelagum salviifolium thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy addition to xeriscaped gardens."
