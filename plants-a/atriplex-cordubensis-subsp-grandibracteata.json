    "intro": "Atriplex cordubensis subsp. grandibracteata, commonly known as the grandibracteate saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, lobed leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, bracteate inflorescences, giving it its subspecific name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and washland habitats. This species is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
