    "intro": "Anacheilium elisae, commonly known as the Elisae's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a short, slender stem with few leaves, and its roots are highly specialized for nutrient absorption from the air. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
