    "intro": "Acacia unguicula, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and small, phyllodes that are typically narrow and pointed. The plant produces yellow floral spikes that bloom in spring, attracting a variety of pollinators. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in drought conditions. Acacia unguicula is also valued for its hardy nature and is often used in landscaping and erosion control.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia unguicula is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the regions of the Pilbara and the Mid West. This plant typically grows in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and inland dunes. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range. Acacia unguicula plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is a characteristic feature of the native vegetation in Western Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia unguicula was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. The plant is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife. Its introduction has sometimes led to competition with native species in certain ecosystems. Despite its benefits, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive."
