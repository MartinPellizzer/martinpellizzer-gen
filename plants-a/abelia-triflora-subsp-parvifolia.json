    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelia triflora subsp. parvifolia is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand. It is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, often growing in shaded, moist environments. This subspecies prefers well-drained soil and is typically found in mixed evergreen forests. It is also occasionally reported from parts of southern China. Its distribution is largely restricted to tropical and subtropical regions within this geographic range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia triflora subsp. parvifolia was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in shaded forest understories. This subspecies is valued for its fragrant white flowers and compact growth habit. It has been widely used in ornamental gardening and landscape design. However, it is considered invasive in some areas due to its rapid spread and competitive nature."
