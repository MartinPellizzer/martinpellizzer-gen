    "intro": "Alchemilla reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves that are hairy and have a distinctive scalloped edge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in upright inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla reflexa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and its ability to thrive in wet conditions."
