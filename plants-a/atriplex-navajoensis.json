    "intro": "Atriplex navajoensis, commonly known as Navajo saltbush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in saline and alkaline soils. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, and it produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters. It is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Navajo saltbush plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
