    "intro": "Alsophila dryopteridoides var. fallacina, commonly known as the dwarf tree fern, is a compact, evergreen fern that forms a dense, tree-like structure. It features a short, stout trunk with a crown of arching fronds that are dark green and slightly serrated. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia and is often found in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in moist, well-drained soil. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in landscaping and indoor gardening."
