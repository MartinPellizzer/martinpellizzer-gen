    "intro": "Andropogon huegelii var. foetidus, commonly known as skunk grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, pale green or brownish flowers in dense, spike-like clusters, which are typically found at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Skunk grass is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is most noticeable when the plant is crushed."
