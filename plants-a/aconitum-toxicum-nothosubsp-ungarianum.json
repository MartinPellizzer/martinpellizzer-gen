It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant produces elliptical, ovate, or lanceolate leaves with serrated margins. It is native to the Carpathian region and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Like other aconites, it contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic to both humans and animals.",
