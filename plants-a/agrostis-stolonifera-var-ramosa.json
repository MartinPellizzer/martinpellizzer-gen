    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera var. ramosa, commonly known as mat grass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is known for its extensive stoloniferous growth, which allows it to spread rapidly and form thick, sod-like mats. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils, particularly in coastal areas and disturbed sites. This variety is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and its use in erosion control and landscaping."
