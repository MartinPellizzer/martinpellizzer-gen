    "intro": "Acroceras gabunense, commonly known as the Gabon sandwort, is a flowering plant native to Central Africa. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, succulent appearance. The plant features small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white or pale blue flowers. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat obscure species within its native range.",
