    "intro": "Arcterica nana subsp. oxycoccoides, commonly known as the dwarf bearberry, is a low-growing shrub native to arctic and alpine regions. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by red berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. Its compact form and hardy nature make it an important component of cold-climate ecosystems."
