    "intro": "Arrhenatherum friesiorum, commonly known as the Friesian feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained to wet soils. The plant features slender, tufted culms with long, narrow leaves that are often tinged with silver or gray. Its inflorescence is a panicle composed of spikelets that are loosely arranged, giving it a feathery appearance. It plays an important ecological role in supporting biodiversity in wetland habitats."
