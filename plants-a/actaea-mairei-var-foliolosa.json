It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically divided into several leaflets, giving it a fern-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in summer, which are followed by red or orange berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.",
