    "intro": "Acer negundo f. flamingo, commonly known as the flamingo maple, is a cultivar of the boxelder tree. It is characterized by its striking, vibrant pink to red foliage that resembles the color of a flamingo, hence its name. The leaves are typically palmately lobed, similar to other maple species, but they tend to be smaller and more delicate. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal, particularly in the fall when the leaves display a range of colors from orange to crimson. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.",
