    "intro": "Atomostigma, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, particularly in countries like India, China, and Indonesia. They are characterized by their striking, star-shaped flowers that often display vibrant yellow or golden hues. The leaves are typically broad and lance-shaped, with a glossy surface that helps in photosynthesis. Atomostigma species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of trees or other structures, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain."
