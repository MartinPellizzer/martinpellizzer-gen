    "intro": "Alsophila imrayana, commonly known as the Imray's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its rhizomes are robust and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients. The fronds are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to two meters, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
