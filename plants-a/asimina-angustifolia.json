It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate, elliptic to ovate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, yellow-orange fruits with a sweet, custard-like pulp. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
