It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a forage crop."
