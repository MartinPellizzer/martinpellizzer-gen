    "intro": "Allium tardiflorum, commonly known as the late-flowering garlic or the Spanish garlic, is a bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of pale lavender to white flowers. The plant produces small, rounded bulbs that are often used as a culinary herb, similar to other Allium species. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Allium tardiflorum is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its edible qualities."
