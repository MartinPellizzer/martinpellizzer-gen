    "intro": "Auricula-ursi tyrolensis, commonly known as the Tyrolean bear's ear, is a rare and alpine plant native to the high mountain regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that resemble the ears of a bear. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pink or red flowers in the summer months. It thrives in rocky, acidic soils at high altitudes, often in subalpine or alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
