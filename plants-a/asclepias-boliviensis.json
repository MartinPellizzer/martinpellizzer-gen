    "intro": "Asclepias boliviensis, commonly known as the Bolivian milkweed, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Bolivia and Peru. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a common feature among milkweeds, and its leaves are typically elliptical with a slightly hairy texture. Asclepias boliviensis plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems, especially as a host plant for the larvae of certain butterfly species."
