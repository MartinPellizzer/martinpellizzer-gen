    "intro": "Ayenia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered ayenia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits called cypselae. Ayenia parviflora is often found in regions with mild climates and is adapted to withstand periods of drought."
