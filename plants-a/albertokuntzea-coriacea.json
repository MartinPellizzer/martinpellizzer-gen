    "intro": "Albertokuntzea coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf acacia, is a shrub native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a rough, textured surface. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control and as a ornamental plant."
