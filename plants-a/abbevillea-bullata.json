    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abbevillea bullata is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia. It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often associated with cypress and mangrove ecosystems. It is also occasionally found in the Caribbean, including parts of Cuba and the Bahamas. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abbevillea bullata was mainly introduced to the eastern United States, particularly in the southeastern region. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, showy flowers. The introduction occurred during the 19th century as part of efforts to diversify garden flora. It has since spread beyond cultivated areas into natural habitats, raising concerns about its ecological impact. This plant is now considered an invasive species in several states where it has displaced native vegetation."
