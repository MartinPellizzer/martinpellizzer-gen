    "intro": "Amelanchier alabamensis, commonly known as the Alabama serviceberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 feet and features oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that ripen to a bright red or purple color in late summer. Its fruit is a valuable food source for birds and small mammals, and it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. The plant is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions."
