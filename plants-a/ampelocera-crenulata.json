    "intro": "Ampelocera crenulata, commonly known as the serrated leaf candelabra, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its branched stems that often trail or hang down, forming a cascading appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. Ampelocera crenulata thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a hanging plant."
