    "intro": "Aconitum dumetorum, commonly known as the European monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant has palmately lobed leaves and produces showy, spore-bearing structures called utricles. Aconitum dumetorum contains toxic alkaloids, making it highly poisonous to both humans and animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats.",
