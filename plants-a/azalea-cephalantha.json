    "intro": "Azalea cephalantha, commonly known as the mountain azalea, is a deciduous shrub native to the Appalachian Mountains in the eastern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, blooming in late spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy. It prefers acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Azalea cephalantha is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
