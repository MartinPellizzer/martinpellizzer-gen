    "intro": "Arum crassipes, commonly known as water arum, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has a distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a showy, usually green or red spathe. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its leaves are broad and floating, while its roots anchor it to the substrate. Arum crassipes is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize wetlands, sometimes becoming invasive in non-native environments."
