This variant is found in the coastal areas of the state of Santa Catarina. It thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soils. The plant is typically found in secondary forests and disturbed habitats. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within this biodiversity-rich ecosystem.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon itatiaiae var. tomentella was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and is commonly found in tropical and subtropical environments. This plant is known for its hairy, woolly leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. It is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its unique appearance and adaptability. However, its introduction can sometimes lead to ecological impacts in non-native regions."
