    "intro": "Asplenium yokoscense, commonly known as the Yokosuka spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually lanceolate and have a serrated margin, with a dark green coloration. Asplenium yokoscense is native to Japan and is often found in humid, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops."
