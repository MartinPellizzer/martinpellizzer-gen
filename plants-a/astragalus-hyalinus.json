    "intro": "Astragalus hyalinus, commonly known as the silverleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pale green to silver-gray leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which are typically pea-like in shape, a typical feature of the Fabaceae family. Astragalus hyalinus thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. It is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
