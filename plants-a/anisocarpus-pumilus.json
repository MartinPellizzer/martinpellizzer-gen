    "intro": "Anisocarpus pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf milkvetch, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, kidney-shaped seeds that are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Anisocarpus pumilus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
