    "intro": "Acer campestre f. hirtivalvum, commonly known as the hairy-leaf maple, is a variant of the common maple tree. It is characterized by its distinctive hairy or pubescent leaves, which give it a unique appearance compared to typical maple leaves. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Its small, yellowish flowers appear in early spring, followed by winged seeds that disperse by wind. The foliage turns vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn, making it a valuable ornamental plant in gardens and parks.",
