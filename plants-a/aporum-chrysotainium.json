    "intro": "Aporum chrysotainium, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow and orange flowers, which resemble flames, and its long, slender stems that often reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers bloom in clusters and are pollinated primarily by specific species of bees and wasps. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a threatened species in its natural range."
