    "intro": "Atraphaxis salicornioides, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in its survival in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its stems are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which reduces water loss. Atraphaxis salicornioides is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a common component of coastal and inland saltbush communities."
