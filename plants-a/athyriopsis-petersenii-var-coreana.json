    "intro": "Athyriopsis petersenii var. coreana, commonly known as the Korean water fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Korea. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in shaded forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of its leaves, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
