    "intro": "Astragalus cruciatus var. longicaulis, commonly known as the long-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender, branching stems that are often covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which are characteristic of the Fabaceae (legume) family. Its leaves are compound, consisting of multiple pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets. This species is adapted to dry environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
