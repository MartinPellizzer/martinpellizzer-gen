    "intro": "Arctium dolicholepis, commonly known as the longleaf burdock. It is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Arctium dolicholepis thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along riverbanks."
