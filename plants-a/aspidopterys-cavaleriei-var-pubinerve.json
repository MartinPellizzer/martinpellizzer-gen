    "intro": "Aspidopterys cavaleriei var. pubinerve, commonly known as the hairy-veined aspidopterys, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It features finely dissected, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, hairy structures, giving it its varietal name. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in shaded, forested areas. Its fronds are characterized by their dark green, glossy appearance and intricate vein patterns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
