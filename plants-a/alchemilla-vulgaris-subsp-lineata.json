    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris subsp. lineata, commonly known as the lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often silver-white beneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shady garden settings. Its common name derives from the belief that it was once used in alchemical processes to produce the philosopher's stone."
