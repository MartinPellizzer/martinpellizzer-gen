    "intro": "Astragalus bersabeensis, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellow to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps it access water from deeper underground. Astragalus bersabeensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
