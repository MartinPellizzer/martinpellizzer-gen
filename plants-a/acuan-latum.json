    "intro": "Acuan latum, commonly known as the broadleaf acuan, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes many aquatic and semi-aquatic plants. The plant is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. Its flowers are small and clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Acuan latum is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystem dynamics.",
