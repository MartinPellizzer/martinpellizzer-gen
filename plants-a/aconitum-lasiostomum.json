    "intro": "Aconitum lasiostomum, commonly known as the rough-stemmed aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant produces follicles containing toxic alkaloids, which make it highly poisonous to both humans and animals. Its leaves are palmately compound, with serrated margins, and the plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its toxicity, it is often cultivated in controlled environments for its ornamental value rather than in gardens.",
