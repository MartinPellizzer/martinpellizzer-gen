    "intro": "Arenaria tetraquetra proles pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant has small, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, appearing in clusters during the spring and early summer. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its harsh, high-altitude habitat."
