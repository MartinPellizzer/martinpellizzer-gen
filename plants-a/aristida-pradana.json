    "intro": "Aristida pradana, commonly known as the pradana grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia, including India and Nepal. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are small, bract-like structures that bear the flowers. Aristida pradana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its delicate appearance."
