    "intro": "Acropera cassidea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often pendulous flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, Acropera cassidea is considered a vulnerable species, making it a subject of interest for conservation efforts.",
