    "intro": "Alsophila camerooniana var. camerooniana, commonly known as the Cameroon tree fern, is a member of the Dicksoniaceae family. It is a tall, evergreen fern that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its large, pinnately divided fronds. The plant has a robust rhizome system that supports its vertical growth and helps anchor it in moist, shaded environments. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in humid, well-drained soils. Its unique botanical structure makes it a notable species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
