    "intro": "Acacia tenuis, commonly known as the slender wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow globular flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Acacia tenuis is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system for water absorption. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia tenuis is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including parts of Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. It is commonly found in sandy soils and is often associated with shrubland and grassland ecosystems. This species is well adapted to dry conditions and can thrive in areas with low rainfall. It is also known to occur in some parts of southwestern Australia. Acacia tenuis plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia tenuis was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a warm, temperate climate. It is commonly found in regions with low rainfall and full sun exposure. This plant has been introduced to parts of Australia, particularly in the southeastern states. It is often used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
