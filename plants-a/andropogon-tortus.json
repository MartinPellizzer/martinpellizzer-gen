    "intro": "Andropogon tortus, commonly known as curly bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted clumps and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often curled at the tips. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in prairie and open woodlands. Curly bluestem is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant landscapes."
