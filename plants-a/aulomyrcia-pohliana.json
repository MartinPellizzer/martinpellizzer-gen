    "intro": "Aulomyrcia pohliana, commonly known as the Pohliana myrtle, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to the coastal regions of southern Brazil, particularly in the state of Santa Catarina. The plant is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of white to pinkish flowers that bloom during the spring and summer months. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, coastal habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
