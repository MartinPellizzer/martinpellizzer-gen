    "intro": "Allophylus rugosus, commonly known as the rough-leafed alder, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its rough, textured bark and oval-shaped leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, spherical berries that are a food source for various wildlife. Allophylus rugosus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or near freshwater habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
