    "intro": "Alvaradoa, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family, which includes many flowering vines and herbs. The plant is characterized by its trumpet-shaped, pale blue to purple flowers that open in the morning and close by midday. Alvaradoa typically grows from a woody base, with slender, trailing stems that can reach up to several feet in length. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment."
