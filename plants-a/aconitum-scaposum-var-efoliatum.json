    "intro": "Aconitum scaposum var. efoliatum, commonly known as the Alpine monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple hooded flowers that resemble a monk's habit, which is a distinctive feature of the genus Aconitum. The plant has dark green, doubly pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes.",
