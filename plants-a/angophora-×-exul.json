    "intro": "Angophora \u00d7 exul, commonly known as the Sydney red gum, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Angophora costata and Angophora robusta. It is a medium to tall tree native to eastern Australia, characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pinkish flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody capsules containing seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and riverine areas. Angophora \u00d7 exul is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes planted in gardens for its distinctive appearance."
