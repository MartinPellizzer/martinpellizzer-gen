    "intro": "Asparagus officinalis var. prostratus, commonly known as creeping asparagus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features succulent, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers in early spring, followed by edible, needle-like berries that mature to a dark red color. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves, each composed of three lance-shaped, fleshy lobes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardy nature."
