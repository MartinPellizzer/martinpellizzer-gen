    "intro": "Arundo rugii, commonly known as the rugose reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, rough, and ridged leaf surfaces, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, such as along riverbanks and in wetlands. Its hollow, jointed stems can reach heights of up to 3 meters, making it a dominant species in its habitat. Arundo rugii is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and its ability to stabilize soil in moist areas."
