    "intro": "Amauriopsis, commonly known as the golden bell vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round, yellow fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fibrous coating. Its rapid growth habit makes it suitable for ornamental use in gardens and as a living fence. However, it can become invasive if not properly managed."
