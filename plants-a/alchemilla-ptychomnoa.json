    "intro": "Alchemilla ptychomnoa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Alchemilla ptychomnoa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
