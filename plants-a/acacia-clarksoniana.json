    "intro": "Acacia clarksoniana, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant is part of the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil. Its flowers are not only ornamental but also serve as a food source for native pollinators. Acacia clarksoniana is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia clarksoniana is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in savannas and shrublands. This species is well adapted to dry conditions and can tolerate high temperatures and low rainfall. It is often seen growing along riverbanks and in rocky outcrops. Acacia clarksoniana plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia clarksoniana was mainly introduced to areas with warm, arid climates where it can thrive in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the northern and western parts of the country. This plant is often used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and attractive, feathery foliage. It has also been introduced to other parts of the world, including parts of the United States and South Africa, for ornamental purposes. However, its spread has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in non-native environments."
