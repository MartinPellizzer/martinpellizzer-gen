    "intro": "Anthemis intermedia, commonly known as the common tansy, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branched stems that are covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are aromatic, with a distinctive camphor-like scent, and are often used in traditional herbal remedies. The plant is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
