    "intro": "Armeriastrum schirazianum, commonly known as the Schiraz cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the arid regions of Iran. It features dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent-like leaves that are fleshy and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often forming compact mats that stabilize sandy or rocky terrain. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
