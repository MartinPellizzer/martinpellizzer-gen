    "intro": "Arundarbor pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf arundel, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of no more than 10 centimeters, with delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of pale pink or white, which bloom in late spring. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Arundarbor pygmaea is often found in moist meadows and along stream banks, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat."
