    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon grewiifolium is primarily native to Brazil North, Peru, and Venezuela. This species is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these countries. It thrives in areas with warm climates and well-drained soils. The plant is often associated with dry to semi-arid habitats. Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to the diverse environmental conditions of these South American regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon grewiifolium was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive, fuzzy leaves and showy flowers. The plant thrives in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and along streambanks. It has become naturalized in some regions, spreading through both seeds and vegetative growth. However, it is considered a non-native species and is not typically invasive in the areas where it is found."
