    "intro": "Achimenes tenella, commonly known as the dwarf gloxinia, is a tropical perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, pink, and white. The plant produces tuberous roots that allow it to survive periods of dormancy, making it suitable for indoor cultivation. Its foliage consists of heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are glossy and velvety to the touch. Achimenes tenella thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil for optimal growth.",
