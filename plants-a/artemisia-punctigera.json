    "intro": "Artemisia punctigera, commonly known as blue artemisia, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves contain volatile oils, which contribute to its strong, camphor-like scent. Artemisia punctigera is often used in traditional medicine for its purported antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties."
