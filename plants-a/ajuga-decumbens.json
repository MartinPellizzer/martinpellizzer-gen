    "intro": "Ajuga decumbens, commonly known as ground ivy or false shamrock, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a slightly serrated edge, often covered in fine hairs. Ajuga decumbens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to suppress weeds in shaded garden environments."
