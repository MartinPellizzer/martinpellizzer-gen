    "intro": "Anemone cyanea, commonly known as the blue anemone, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its delicate, showy blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a basal rosette of hairy, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its coastal habitat. Its flowers are typically 1 to 2 inches in diameter and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Anemone cyanea thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky coastal areas."
