It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows on rock surfaces, particularly in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizomes are short and often covered in a dense layer of moss-like growth. The fronds are typically divided into small, oblong segments with a distinctive, toothed margin."
