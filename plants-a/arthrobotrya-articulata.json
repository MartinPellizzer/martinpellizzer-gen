    "intro": "Arthrobotrya articulata, commonly known as the articulated liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its thalloid structure, which is typically segmented and leafy, with a distinct central axis and lateral branches. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a central stem that is often ribbed and bears small, scale-like leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can absorb moisture through its entire surface. Arthrobotrya articulata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
