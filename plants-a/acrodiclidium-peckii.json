    "intro": "Acrodiclidium peckii, commonly known as the Peck's ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often found in cloud forests. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sporangia, are located on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acrodiclidium peckii is considered a vulnerable species.",
