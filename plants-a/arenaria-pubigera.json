    "intro": "Arenaria pubigera, commonly known as the pubescent sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically has a mat-forming growth habit with hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in harsh environments. Its flowers are usually white or pink, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Arenaria pubigera is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, dry climates."
