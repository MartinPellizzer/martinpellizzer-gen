It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in late summer and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.",
