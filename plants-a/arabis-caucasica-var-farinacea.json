    "intro": "Arabis caucasica var. farinacea, commonly known as the Caucasus rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are coated with a fine, powdery bloom. The plant produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers during the spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens and rockeries in temperate regions."
