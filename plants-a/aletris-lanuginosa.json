    "intro": "Aletris lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly basket fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly covering on its stems and leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its foliage consists of narrow, strap-like leaves that form a rosette, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in late spring. Aletris lanuginosa is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in partial shade."
