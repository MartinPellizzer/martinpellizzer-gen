    "intro": "Acaena splendens var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf bullion bush, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, spiny growth habit and bright yellow flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces small, edible berries that are often consumed by birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are broad and lobed, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its native environment. This variety is distinguished by its larger leaves compared to the typical Acaena splendens.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena splendens var. macrophylla is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury and Otago regions. This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as shrublands and grasslands. It is well adapted to the temperate climate and nutrient-poor soils of these areas. The variety is known for its bright yellow flowers and is an important component of local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena splendens var. macrophylla was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the northern parts of the country. It is commonly found in open areas, such as roadsides and forest margins. However, it is considered a potential weed in some ecosystems due to its ability to spread rapidly."
