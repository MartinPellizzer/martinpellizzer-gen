    "intro": "Arctostaphylos tomentosa var. tomentosiformis, commonly known as the silverleaf manzanita, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage, which results from its thick, woolly coating of fine hairs. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in clusters, typically in shades of pink or white, during the spring. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
