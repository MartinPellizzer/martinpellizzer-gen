    "intro": "Acetosella arenaria, commonly known as sand pennywort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and coastal regions. It has small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny white or pink flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in dunes or rocky habitats. Its leaves are succulent, allowing it to store water, which helps it survive in arid conditions. Acetosella arenaria is a member of the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its ability to tolerate salt and wind exposure.",
