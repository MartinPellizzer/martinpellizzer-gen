    "intro": "Amaranthus arvensis, commonly known as common amaranth, is an annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions. It features erect stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, covered with small, rough, bristly hairs. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a bluish-green hue and a waxy coating, and the flowers are small, clustered in dense, spiky inflorescences. It produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-angled, prickly seeds. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
