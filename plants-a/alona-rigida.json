    "intro": "Alona rigida, commonly known as the rigid water frog or water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that provide shade and habitat for aquatic organisms. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface, typically in the summer months. Its roots are anchored in the sediment, allowing it to thrive in still or slow-moving water bodies. Alona rigida plays an important role in maintaining water quality and supporting biodiversity in its ecosystem."
