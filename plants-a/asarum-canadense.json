    "intro": "Asarum canadense, commonly known as Canadian wild ginger, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces small, reddish-brown flowers that are clustered in a spathaceous structure, which is typical of the Aristolochiaceae family. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, ginger-like scent, which is most noticeable when the leaves are crushed."
