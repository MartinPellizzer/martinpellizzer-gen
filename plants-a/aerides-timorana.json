    "intro": "Aerides timorana, commonly known as the Timor orchid, is a species of orchid native to the islands of Timor and nearby regions in Indonesia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowers. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a yellow or greenish throat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aerides timorana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
