    "intro": "Anthoxanthum quebrada, commonly known as the broken grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with a pale yellow or greenish hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitat."
