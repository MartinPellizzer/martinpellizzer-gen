    "intro": "Aechmea tonduzii, commonly known as the Tonduzia bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with colorful bracts that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from intense sunlight. Aechmea tonduzii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
