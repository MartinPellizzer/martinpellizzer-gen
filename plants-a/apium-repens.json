    "intro": "Apium repens, commonly known as marsh parsley, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often reddish stems that grow from a rhizomatous root system. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic and slightly hairy. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Apium repens thrives in moist, shady environments such as wet meadows and stream banks."
