    "intro": "Artemisia alba subsp. saxatilis, commonly known as white mugwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and rocky regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in dense, fine hairs that reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in panicles, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as cliffs and slopes. Its aromatic properties and adaptability to harsh environments make it a notable species in ecological and horticultural contexts."
