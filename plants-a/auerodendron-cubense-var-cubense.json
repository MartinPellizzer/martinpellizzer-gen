    "intro": "Auerodendron cubense var. cubense, commonly known as the Cuban sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued for its scent and durability. The plant has simple, opposite, elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by dark purple berries, which are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
