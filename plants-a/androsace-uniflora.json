    "intro": "Androsace uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower rock lettuce, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense cushions of fleshy, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or gray hairs. The plant produces a single, showy white or pink flower at the end of each stem, usually in late spring or early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its compact form and ornamental flowers, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shady, moist areas."
