    "intro": "Adiantum scandens, commonly known as the climbing maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a lacy appearance. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its rhizomes are wiry and capable of climbing, allowing it to ascend trees and other structures. Adiantum scandens prefers shady, humid environments and is often found in forest understories.",
