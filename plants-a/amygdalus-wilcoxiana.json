    "intro": "Amygdalus wilcoxiana, commonly known as the Wilcox almond, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the island of Socotra in the Arabian Sea. It is a small, deciduous tree that produces distinctive, almond-shaped fruits with a thick, leathery exterior. The plant belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its unique, palmate leaves and fragrant, white flowers. Its botanical significance lies in its evolutionary uniqueness and ecological importance to the Socotra archipelago's biodiversity. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is listed as vulnerable by the IUCN Red List."
