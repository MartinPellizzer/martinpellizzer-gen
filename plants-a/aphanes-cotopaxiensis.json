    "intro": "Aphanes cotopaxiensis, commonly known as the Cotopaxi sandweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in its arid environment. It produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Aphanes cotopaxiensis is adapted to rocky and sandy soils and is often found in alpine habitats."
