    "intro": "Aeschynomene divisa, commonly known as the divided aeschynomene, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, alternate leaves that are often divided into lobes. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically followed by cylindrical, hairy seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
