    "intro": "Arberella humilis, commonly known as the dwarf arberella, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, with slender, hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, oval-shaped seeds. Arberella humilis thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
