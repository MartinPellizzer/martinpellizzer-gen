    "intro": "Aralia octonata, commonly known as American aralia, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves with feather-like divisions, typically arranged in an umbel-like pattern at the ends of its stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red berries that attract birds. Its roots are fibrous and can spread extensively, making it a persistent weed in woodland areas. The plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
