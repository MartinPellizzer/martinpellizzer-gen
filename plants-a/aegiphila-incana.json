    "intro": "Aegiphila incana, commonly known as the silverleaf aegiphila, is a shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Aegiphila incana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
