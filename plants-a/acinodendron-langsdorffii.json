    "intro": "Acinodendron langsdorffii, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and dense, rounded crown. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by fleshy, greenish-yellow fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. The tree is also noted for its ability to exude a milky sap when injured, which is a common trait among members of the Euphorbiaceae family.",
