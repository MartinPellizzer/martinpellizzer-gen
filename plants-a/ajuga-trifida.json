    "intro": "Ajuga trifida, commonly known as carpet bugle or heartleaf bugle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple. Ajuga trifida is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments. It is also known for its medicinal properties, though it is primarily cultivated for its aesthetic value."
