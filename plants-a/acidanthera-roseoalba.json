    "intro": "Acidanthera roseoalba, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the orchid family. It is native to the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa, where it thrives in rocky, coastal habitats. The plant features a slender, often branched stem and produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers with a unique, ghost-like appearance. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.",
