    "intro": "Alsophila rupestris, commonly known as the rock herringbone fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of fronds that are divided into a herringbone pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting its growth and helping it anchor to rocky substrates. The fronds are evergreen, providing year-round foliage and contributing to the plant's ornamental value."
