    "intro": "Arum curvatum, commonly known as the bent-leaf arum, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves and striking inflorescence that resembles a spathe. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered within a spadix, a feature common in many arum species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. The plant is occasionally cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique foliage and floral structure."
