    "intro": "Acer macrophyllum f. imbricatum, commonly known as the Oregon maple, is a variant of the bigleaf maple characterized by its broad, palmately lobed leaves. The leaves are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. This shrub or small tree thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is often found in riparian zones and forest understories, where it contributes to biodiversity and provides habitat for various wildlife species. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes.",
