    "intro": "Azedarac, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the savannas of southern Africa. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces small, round, yellowish fruits that contain winged seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a slightly serrated edge. Azedarac is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
