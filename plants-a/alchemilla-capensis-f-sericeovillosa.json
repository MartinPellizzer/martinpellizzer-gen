    "intro": "Alchemilla capensis f. sericeovillosa, commonly known as the silky-stemmed lady's mantle, is a variant of the alchemilla genus native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silvery, hairy stems and heart-shaped, toothed leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in dense, rounded clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in temperate climates."
