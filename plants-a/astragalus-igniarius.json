    "intro": "Astragalus igniarius, commonly known as the fireweed or red milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and mountainous regions. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus igniarius plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
