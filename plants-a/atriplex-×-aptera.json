    "intro": "Atriplex \u00d7 aptera, commonly known as the silverleaf dogwood, is a hybrid plant that exhibits characteristics of its parent species, Atriplex and other related genera. It is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. The plant is notable for its silvery-gray foliage, which reflects sunlight and reduces water loss, an adaptation to hot, dry environments. Its leaves are typically small, lobed, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Atriplex \u00d7 aptera is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
