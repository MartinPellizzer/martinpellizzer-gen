    "intro": "Astragalus hirsutus var. hispidus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in raceme clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, deserts, and disturbed areas. Astragalus hirsutus var. hispidus plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
