It features showy, daisy-like flowers with purple petals and a distinctive brown central cone. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to retain moisture. Aster multiformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
