    "intro": "Anisochilus rupestris, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often clustered closely together. The plant typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, preferring moist, well-drained soil. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typical of many ferns. Anisochilus rupestris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
