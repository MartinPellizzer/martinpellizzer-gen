    "intro": "Allium bogdoicola, commonly known as the Mongolian leek, is a perennial herb native to the steppes of Mongolia and northern China. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of long, narrow leaves. The plant produces a single, slender flowering stem that bears umbels of white or pale purple flowers. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, onion-like flavor, making it a valuable crop in traditional cuisines. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
