    "intro": "Argemone pinnatisecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf argemone, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers and finely divided, pinnatisected leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiky capsule, and the plant is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
