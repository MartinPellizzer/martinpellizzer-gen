    "intro": "Amphoricarpos neumayerianus subsp. autariatus, commonly known as the Neumayer's amporicarpos, is a perennial shrub native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, pink to reddish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces small, round, fleshy fruits that are adapted for dispersal by animals. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native high-altitude ecosystems."
