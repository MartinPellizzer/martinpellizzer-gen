It is native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly China and Korea. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that is covered in a fine, silvery-white layer of wax, giving it its common name. Its showy, bell-shaped flowers are typically pink or white, blooming in early spring. Azalea squamata prefers acidic, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
