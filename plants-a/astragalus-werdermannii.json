    "intro": "Astragalus werdermannii, commonly known as Werdermann's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are usually compound with a feathery appearance. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
