    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia longifolia f. sophorae is primarily native to southern Australia, including the states of Western Australia, South Australia, and Victoria. This subspecies is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils, particularly in regions with a Mediterranean climate. It thrives in dry, well-drained environments and is often associated with heathlands and coastal dunes. The plant is well adapted to the local climate and can tolerate salt spray and sandy conditions. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia longifolia f. sophorae was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and for ornamental purposes in coastal and sandy areas. It is commonly found in regions such as southern California, Oregon, and parts of the Pacific Northwest. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for dune stabilization and landscape planting. However, it has become an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands have led to its classification as a noxious weed in several states."
