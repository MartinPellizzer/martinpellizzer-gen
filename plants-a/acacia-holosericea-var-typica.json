    "intro": "Acacia holosericea var. typica, commonly known as the coastal wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and phyllodes that are linear to narrowly elliptic, typically covered in a fine, silky white pubescence. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads that appear in late winter to early spring, attracting a variety of pollinators. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas with a Mediterranean climate. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is cultivated in gardens and used in reforestation projects.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia holosericea var. typica is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. This plant is commonly found in savannas, grasslands, and rocky outcrops where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall, making it a characteristic species of the region's dry climate. The variety is often seen growing along riverbanks and in open woodlands. Its presence is an indicator of the ecological conditions typical of these native habitats.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia holosericea var. typica was mainly introduced to areas with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in coastal regions and inland valleys. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its deep root system and ability to tolerate drought. It has also been introduced as an ornamental plant in gardens and parks for its attractive foliage and flowering. However, its invasive potential in some regions has raised concerns about its ecological impact."
