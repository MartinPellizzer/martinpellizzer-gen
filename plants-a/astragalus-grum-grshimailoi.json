    "intro": "Astragalus grum-grshimailoi, commonly known as the Karakum astragalus, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia, particularly found in the arid regions of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, semi-desert environments. It has small, compound leaves and produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within the Astragalus genus."
