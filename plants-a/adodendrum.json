    "intro": "Adodendrum, commonly known as the silver bush, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their shrub-like growth habit and silvery-gray foliage. Adodendrum species typically produce small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The leaves are usually small, elliptical, and have a distinctive waxy coating that reflects light. These plants are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry, well-drained soils."
