    "intro": "Arenaria aggregata var. frigida, commonly known as the cold sandplant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of small, succulent leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, cold climates. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in the summer months, adding a delicate touch to its rocky or sandy habitats. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in tundra or high-altitude environments. Due to its resilience, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small arctic organisms."
