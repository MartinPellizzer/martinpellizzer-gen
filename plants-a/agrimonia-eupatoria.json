    "intro": "Agrimonia eupatoria, commonly known as common agrimony, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features upright, branched stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by reddish-brown, capsule-like fruits. Agrimony is often found in dry meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it has a long history of use in traditional herbal medicine. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and ecologically significant plant in its native habitats."
