    "intro": "Asplenium hieronymi, commonly known as the Hieronymus's spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically divided into numerous small, finger-like segments. This plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium hieronymi is noted for its delicate appearance and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
