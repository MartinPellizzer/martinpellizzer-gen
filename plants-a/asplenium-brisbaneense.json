    "intro": "Asplenium brisbaneense, commonly known as Brisbane spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. The plant has a compact rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy. It produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and threatened species."
