    "intro": "Asperula tomentosa var. deficiens, commonly known as the woolly woodruff, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, fuzzy foliage that gives it a soft, woolly appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are typically clustered in umbels. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
