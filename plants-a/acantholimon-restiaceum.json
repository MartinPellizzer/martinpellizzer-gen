    "intro": "Acantholimon restiaceum, commonly known as the coastal flax or sea flax, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of North America. It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and showy blue to purple flowers. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal dunes and rocky shores, often in areas with strong winds and salt spray. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for various invertebrates. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to habitat disruption, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions.",

It thrives in rocky and semi-arid environments, often growing on slopes and in mountainous areas. The species is adapted to the local climate and soil conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is limited to these particular ecological zones within Iran.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon restiaceum was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of flowering plants for ornamental purposes. The plant is native to southern Africa and has since become naturalized in certain regions of New Zealand. It is often found in coastal and inland areas with well-drained soils. Its distribution in New Zealand is limited to specific habitats where it can thrive."
