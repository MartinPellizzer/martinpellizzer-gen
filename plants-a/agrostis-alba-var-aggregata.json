    "intro": "Agrostis alba var. aggregata, commonly known as silvergrass or whitegrass, is a variant of the common bentgrass species. It is a low-growing perennial grass that typically forms dense, tufted clumps. The plant is characterized by its slender, silver-green leaves and small, inconspicuous spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the plant. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
