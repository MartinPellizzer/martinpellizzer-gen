    "intro": "Asperula canescens var. subglabra, commonly known as the silky woodruff, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters along the stems. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine, silky pubescence that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade. This plant is often used in woodland gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
