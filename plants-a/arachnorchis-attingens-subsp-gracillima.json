    "intro": "Arachnorchis attingens subsp. gracillima, commonly known as the slender spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or loamy soils within heathlands and open forests. The plant features a slender, wiry stem with a single, narrow leaf and a spike of small, greenish-white flowers. Its flowering period occurs in late winter to early spring, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
