    "intro": "Ananassa sativa var. milleri, commonly known as the miller's pineapple, is a cultivar of the pineapple plant native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, spiky appearance and is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage. The leaves are long, grass-like, and have a sharp, serrated edge. While it produces small, edible fruits, it is primarily cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens. This variety thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
