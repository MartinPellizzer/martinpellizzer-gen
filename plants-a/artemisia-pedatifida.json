    "intro": "Artemisia pedatifida, commonly known as the broadleaf wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its gray-green, aromatic foliage with fern-like, pinnately divided leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in late summer. Artemisia pedatifida is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. It is used in traditional medicine and has a strong, distinctive scent due to its high concentration of volatile oils."
