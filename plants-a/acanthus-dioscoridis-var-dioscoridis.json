This species is found in the mountainous regions of these countries. It thrives in rocky and limestone soils, often growing in dry and sunny environments. The plant is commonly seen in areas with a Mediterranean or semi-arid climate. Its distribution is closely associated with the natural habitats of the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus dioscoridis var. dioscoridis was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its striking foliage and architectural form. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and public spaces for its aesthetic value. The plant is often used in Mediterranean-style gardens and as a specimen plant in urban landscapes. Its introduction has been facilitated by its adaptability to a range of soil types and its relatively low maintenance requirements. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native regions."
