    "intro": "Austrocephalocereus estevesii subsp. grandiflora, commonly known as the Grandiflora Cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and large, showy white flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique morphology and ornamental value make it a sought-after specimen among cactus enthusiasts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
