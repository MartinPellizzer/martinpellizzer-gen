    "intro": "Archibaccharis corymbosa, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features dense, glossy dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and wetlands. Its ornamental value and ability to tolerate salt spray make it a popular choice for landscaping in coastal areas."
