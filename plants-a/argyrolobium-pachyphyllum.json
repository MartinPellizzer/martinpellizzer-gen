    "intro": "Argyrolobium pachyphyllum, commonly known as the thick-leaved silver globular pea, is a perennial legume native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, globular growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in spring. It has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in dry, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
