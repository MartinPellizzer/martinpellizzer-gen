    "intro": "Allium trifoliatum var. sterile, commonly known as the sterile garlic chive, is a botanical variant of the garlic chive plant. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and the absence of flowering stems, which distinguishes it from the typical varietal form. This variant is often cultivated for its edible leaves, which have a mild garlic flavor. The plant thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil. Its growth habit makes it suitable for use in ornamental gardens as well as in culinary applications."
