    "intro": "Aconitum \u00d7 intermedium var. versicolor, commonly known as the hybrid monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple spurred flowers, which are arranged in dense, conical clusters. The plant features large, palmately lobed leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in temperate climates. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
