    "intro": "Astragalus atropatanus, commonly known as the dark-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep purple. The plant produces pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Astragalus atropatanus plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native ecosystems."
