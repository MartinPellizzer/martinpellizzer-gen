It features large, heart-shaped leaves with a deep, velvety black color and prominent white veins, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions, though it prefers indirect sunlight. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense foliage. Alocasia korthalsii is also valued for its air-purifying qualities and its ability to add a dramatic aesthetic to any space."
