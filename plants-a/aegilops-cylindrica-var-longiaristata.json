It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical spikelets and awned lemmas. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and is often found in disturbed soils. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This variety is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to various environmental conditions."
