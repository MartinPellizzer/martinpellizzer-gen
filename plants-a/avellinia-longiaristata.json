It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance. Avellinia longiaristata is valued for its ecological role in supporting diverse wildlife and its potential use in traditional medicine."
