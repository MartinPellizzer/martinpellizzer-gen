    "intro": "Austrocephalocereus estevesii subsp. insigniflorus, commonly known as the Cape Town candelabra cactus, is a unique species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that develops into a branched, tree-like structure with age. The plant produces white, tubular flowers that bloom in summer, adding ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its slow growth rate and distinctive appearance make it a prized specimen in botanical gardens and collections."
