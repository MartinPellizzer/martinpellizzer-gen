    "intro": "Asplenium macraei var. sphenolobium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf harts-tongue fern, is a rare and distinctive fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a unique, elongated shape. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or wooded areas. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
