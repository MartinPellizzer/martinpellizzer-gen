    "intro": "Aphylax spiralis, commonly known as the spiral liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its structure consists of a thalloid body with leaf-like structures called phyllidia. Aphylax spiralis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various invertebrates."
