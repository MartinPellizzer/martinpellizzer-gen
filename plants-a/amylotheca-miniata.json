    "intro": "Amylotheca miniata, commonly known as the miniature orchid or dwarf orchid, is a small, epiphytic plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant features delicate, hairy leaves and produces tiny, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich substrates. Due to its small size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
