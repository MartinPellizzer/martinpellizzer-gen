    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. biebersteinii, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, velvety leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along streambanks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
