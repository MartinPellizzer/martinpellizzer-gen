    "intro": "Ammannia alternifolia, commonly known as prairie willow or redroot, is a herbaceous perennial native to the central United States. It features alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish at the base, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in prairies, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it valuable for erosion control in wetland habitats."
