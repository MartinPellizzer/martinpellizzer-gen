    "intro": "Aralia fargesii var. yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan aralia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often arranged in a feather-like pattern, and its clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces berries that are dark blue to black in color, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
