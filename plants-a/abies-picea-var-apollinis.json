    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies picea var. apollinis is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in areas of California, Oregon, and Washington. This variant of the white fir is commonly found in high-elevation forests and mountainous regions. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils. The plant is often associated with mixed coniferous forests and is adapted to the specific ecological conditions of its native range. Its distribution is limited to specific geographic areas where the climate and soil conditions are suitable for its growth.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies picea var. apollinis was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its unique appearance and adaptability. It is valued for its dense foliage, conical shape, and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. This variety is often used in urban settings where its compact size and tolerance to pollution make it a desirable choice. However, it has also been reported to escape cultivation and establish itself in natural areas, raising concerns about its invasive potential. Its introduction has led to increased monitoring in regions where it may compete with native plant species."
