    "intro": "Acer monspessulanum subsp. assyriacum, commonly known as the Assyrian maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Middle East and parts of Anatolia. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves, which are typically 5-7 lobed and have a bright green upper surface with a silvery underside. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for gardens and parks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental value and historical significance in ancient cultures.",
