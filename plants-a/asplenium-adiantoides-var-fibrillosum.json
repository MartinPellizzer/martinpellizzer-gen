    "intro": "Asplenium adiantoides var. fibrillosum, commonly known as the fern moss or slender maidenhair fern, is a species of polypodioid fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth or on rock surfaces. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, finely serrated margin. The spore-producing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a single row along the veins."
