    "intro": "Arenaria ciliolata var. pendula, commonly known as the hanging sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features slender, pendulous stems that dangle from its base, creating a cascading appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. This variety is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in cold climates with ample sunlight."
