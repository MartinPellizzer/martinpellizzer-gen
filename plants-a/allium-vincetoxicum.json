    "intro": "Allium vincetoxicum, commonly known as the lesser garlic or wild garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale pink flowers in early summer, followed by bulbous structures that resemble garlic cloves. Its leaves and bulbs contain sulfur compounds that contribute to its sharp, pungent aroma. Allium vincetoxicum is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and disturbed soils, and it has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential health benefits."
