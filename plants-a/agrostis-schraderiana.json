    "intro": "Agrostis schraderiana, commonly known as Schrader's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early autumn, and it is known for its fine texture and ornamental value in gardens. Agrostis schraderiana is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability."
