    "intro": "Asplenium bullatum, commonly known as the clustered spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth pattern. The plant has slender, lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in dense clusters around the central stem. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the leaves and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium bullatum is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in temperate and tropical regions."
