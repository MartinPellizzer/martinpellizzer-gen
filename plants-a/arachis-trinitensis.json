    "intro": "Arachis trinitensis, commonly known as the Trinidad peanut, is a species of legume native to South America. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Arachis genus. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into pods containing edible seeds, which are similar to common peanuts. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
