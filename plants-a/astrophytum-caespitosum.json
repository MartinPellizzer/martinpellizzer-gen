    "intro": "Astrophytum caespitosum, commonly known as the cactus apple or moon cactus, is a species of flowering cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and spiny, segmented stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for both humans and animals. Its structure is adapted for drought resistance, with a shallow root system and thick, fleshy stems that minimize water loss. Astrophytum caespitosum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
