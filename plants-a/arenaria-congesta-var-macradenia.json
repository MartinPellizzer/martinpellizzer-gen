    "intro": "Arenaria congesta var. macradenia, commonly known as the clustered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a suitable plant for rock gardens and alpine displays."
