    "intro": "Acrostichum obliquum, commonly known as the slant-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often curved fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with small, spore-producing structures called sori on the underside. Acrostichum obliquum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light.",
