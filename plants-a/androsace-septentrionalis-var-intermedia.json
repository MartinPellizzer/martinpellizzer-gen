    "intro": "Androsace septentrionalis var. intermedia, commonly known as the northern sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine and subalpine regions of northern Europe and North America. It typically features dense, cushion-like growth habit with small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, often hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to high-altitude conditions with limited nutrients and extreme temperature fluctuations."
