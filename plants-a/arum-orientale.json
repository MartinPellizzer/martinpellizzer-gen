    "intro": "Arum orientale, commonly known as the oriental arrowhead, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a waxy texture. The plant produces dramatic, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a showy, violet-purple spathe. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. However, it contains calcium oxalate crystals, making it toxic if ingested."
