    "intro": "Agrostis canina var. diffusa, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Its inflorescence consists of slender, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed florets. Agrostis canina var. diffusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass applications."
