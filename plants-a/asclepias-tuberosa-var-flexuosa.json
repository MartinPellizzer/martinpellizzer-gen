It is characterized by its zigzagging stems and clusters of orange to yellow flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain toxic, silky seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in prairies and open woodlands. This species is an important host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and supports a variety of pollinators."
