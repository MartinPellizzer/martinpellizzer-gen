    "intro": "Astragalus complanatus subsp. eutrichus, commonly known as the plains milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the central and western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, sagebrush steppe, and rocky soils. The plant features slender, erect stems that are often branched and covered with soft, hairy foliage. Its small, pea-like flowers are usually pale blue to purple, and it produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations."
