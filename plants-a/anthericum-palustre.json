    "intro": "Anthericum palustre, commonly known as marsh anthericum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe and Asia. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in a dense, spike-like inflorescence. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and marshes. Anthericum palustre plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and nectar for various insects."
