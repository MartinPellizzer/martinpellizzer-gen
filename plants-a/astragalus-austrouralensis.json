    "intro": "Astragalus austrouralensis, commonly known as the southern alpine milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
