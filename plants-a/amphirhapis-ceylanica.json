    "intro": "Amphirhapis ceylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the wet tropical forests of Sri Lanka. It is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood, which is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by woody capsules containing seeds. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as critically endangered."
