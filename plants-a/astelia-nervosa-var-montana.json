    "intro": "[WRONG START] Astellia nervosa var. montana, commonly known as the mountain astelia, is a perennial plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth habit and stiff, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates."
