    "intro": "Androsace hemisphaerica, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in alpine meadows and mountain tundras. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in harsh, arid environments. Androsace hemisphaerica plays a role in stabilizing soil in its ecological niche and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
