    "intro": "Ambrosia chamissonis var. bipinnatisecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Ambrosia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, bipinnatisect leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense, branched clusters called panicles. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its allergenic properties, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
