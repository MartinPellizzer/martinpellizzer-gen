    "intro": "Agropyron pringlei, commonly known as Pringle's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Agropyron pringlei is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
