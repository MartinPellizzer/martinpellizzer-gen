    "intro": "Angostura adenanthera, commonly known as the arrowroot plant, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy roots that are rich in starch, making it a valuable source of carbohydrates. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along riverbanks. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a smooth texture and a waxy surface. The flowers are small and clustered, often in greenish-white or yellowish hues, and are pollinated by insects."
