    "intro": "Amauropelta cocos, commonly known as the coconut palm, is a tropical plant native to the Pacific and Indian Oceans. It is a tall, slender tree with a straight trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces a distinctive fruit called a coconut, which contains both water and a white, fleshy interior known as the endosperm. Its root system is fibrous, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. The coconut palm is widely cultivated for its fruit, oil, and other by-products."
