    "intro": "Aphania danura, commonly known as the coastal daisy, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coast, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its growth habit is low and spreading, often forming dense mats that help stabilize dune environments. Aphania danura plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
