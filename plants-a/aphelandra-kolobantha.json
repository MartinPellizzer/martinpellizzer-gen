    "intro": "Aphelandra kolobantha, commonly known as the Hawaiian flame tree, is a tropical plant native to the islands of Hawaii. It is characterized by its striking, bright orange or red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in panicles, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aphelandra kolobantha is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and greenhouses due to its vibrant appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
