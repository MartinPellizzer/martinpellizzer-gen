    "intro": "Alnus tirolensis, commonly known as the Tirolensis alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins that are typical of the alder genus, and it flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or subalpine environments. Alnus tirolensis plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
