    "intro": "Allocarya lithocarya, commonly known as the stonecrop saxifrage, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Saxifragaceae. It is native to mountainous regions in the northern hemisphere, particularly in areas with rocky or alpine substrates. The plant is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and fleshy, often succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers, typically pink or white, are clustered in dense inflorescences and bloom in late summer. Allocarya lithocarya is adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species found in high-altitude ecosystems."
