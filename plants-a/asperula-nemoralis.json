    "intro": "Asperula nemoralis, commonly known as sweet woodruff, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early summer, often arranged in clusters. Its leaves are heart-shaped and emit a pleasant aroma when crushed, which has been historically used in perfumes and as a flavoring agent. Asperula nemoralis thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
