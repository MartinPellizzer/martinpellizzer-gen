It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from green to red or purple. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha grandis var. akoensis is primarily native to the island of Madagascar. It is found in the eastern part of the island, particularly in the northeastern region. This plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and is commonly found in moist, shaded forest understories. It is often associated with secondary growth and disturbed habitats. The species is known for its striking foliage and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha grandis var. akoensis was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. The introduction occurred in the late 19th or early 20th century. It has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. However, it is not considered invasive and poses minimal ecological risk."
