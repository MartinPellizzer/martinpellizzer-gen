    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria f. pseudodillenii, commonly known as the false dillen's clover, is a botanical variant of the common anthyllis. It is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its dense clusters of small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant is often found in dry, sandy soils. This subspecies is native to southern Europe and is adapted to thrive in arid and rocky environments. Its morphology and habitat preferences make it a notable species within the Fabaceae family."
