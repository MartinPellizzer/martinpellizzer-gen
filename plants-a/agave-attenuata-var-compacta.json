    "intro": "Agave attenuata var. compacta, commonly known as the compact agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-forming growth pattern, with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The leaves are often adorned with white or grayish markings, giving the plant a striking appearance. It produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear small, white flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and bats. This variety is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
