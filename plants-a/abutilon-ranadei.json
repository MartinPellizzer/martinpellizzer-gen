    "intro": "Abutilon ranadei, commonly known as the velvetleaf abutilon, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with multiple stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Abutilon ranadei is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique floral display.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon ranadei is primarily native to India. It is found in various regions across the country, particularly in the southern and eastern states. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded areas. It is commonly associated with forested regions and is sometimes found in disturbed habitats. Its native distribution in India highlights its ecological significance in local biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon ranadei was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, maple-like leaves and showy flowers. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in various habitats, including disturbed soils and along roadsides. It is considered an invasive species in some parts of its range due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Efforts are being made to control its spread and prevent further ecological impact."
