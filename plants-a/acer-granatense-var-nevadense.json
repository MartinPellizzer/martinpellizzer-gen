    "intro": "Acer granatense var. nevadense, commonly known as the Nevada maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Nevada, United States. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.",
