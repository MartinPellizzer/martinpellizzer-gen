    "intro": "Abutilon mexiae, commonly known as Mexican velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Abutilon mexiae thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and full sun exposure.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon mexiae is primarily native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is found in regions such as southern Mexico, including the states of Oaxaca, Chiapas, and Veracruz. This plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical areas, often in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It thrives in humid climates with adequate sunlight. Abutilon mexiae is commonly associated with lowland and hillside habitats.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon mexiae was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, disturbed areas such as stream banks and forest edges. This plant is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It has been documented in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California. Its introduction is often associated with human activities such as landscaping and erosion control efforts."
