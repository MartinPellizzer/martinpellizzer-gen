    "intro": "Agrostis anatolica, commonly known as Anatolian bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in well-drained soils and moderate climates. Agrostis anatolica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
