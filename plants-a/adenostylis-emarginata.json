    "intro": "Adenostylis emarginata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sea hare, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of grasses. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and is adapted to salt spray and strong coastal winds. Adenostylis emarginata plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for various invertebrates.",
