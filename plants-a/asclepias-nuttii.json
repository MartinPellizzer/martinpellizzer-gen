It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by seed pods containing silky-haired seeds. Asclepias nuttii is a host plant for the monarch butterfly and plays an important role in supporting pollinators. It thrives in rocky, dry habitats and is adapted to arid environments."
