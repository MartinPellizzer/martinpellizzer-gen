    "intro": "Ancipitia niveoglobula, commonly known as the snowball lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has smooth, glossy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. Its root system consists of thick, fleshy rhizomes that store nutrients and help it survive in harsh alpine conditions. Ancipitia niveoglobula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
