    "intro": "Acantholimon butkovii, commonly known as the Butkov's thornscale, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and spikes of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is a perennial species that thrives in high-altitude areas with cool temperatures and moderate precipitation. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant species.",

It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in steppe and desert environments. It is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of Central Asia. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in Uzbekistan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon butkovii was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in arid or semi-arid regions. It is commonly found in rocky or gravelly habitats, often growing in open landscapes such as slopes and disturbed soils. This plant is adapted to survive in environments with low rainfall and high temperatures. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. However, it may become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
