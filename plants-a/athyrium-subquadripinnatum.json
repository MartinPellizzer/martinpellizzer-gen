    "intro": "Athyrium subquadripinnatum, commonly known as the four-pinnate Athyrium, is a fern species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that exhibit a distinctive four-pinnate structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, a feature common to many ferns. The plant's ornamental value makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and shaded landscapes."
