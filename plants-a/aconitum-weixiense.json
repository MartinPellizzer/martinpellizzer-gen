    "intro": "Aconitum weixiense, commonly known as the Weixi aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and clusters of blue to purple flowers. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers that are typically arranged in racemes, and its leaves are palmately divided with serrated edges. Aconitum weixiense is known for containing potent alkaloids, which make it toxic and require careful handling. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high altitudes.",
