    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha angustata var. glabra is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments, often growing in forest understories or along stream banks. It is also known to occur in parts of the Indian subcontinent, including India and Sri Lanka. The species is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with a suitable climate.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha angustata var. glabra was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant spreads rapidly through seeds and can establish itself in disturbed areas. Its introduction has led to management efforts to control its spread and protect local biodiversity."
