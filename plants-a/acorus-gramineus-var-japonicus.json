    "intro": "Acorus gramineus var. japonicus, commonly known as Japanese sweetflag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that grow in dense clumps, often forming a rosette structure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in a spadix, typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and pond margins, and is often found in shallow water or damp soil. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation in suitable habitats.",
