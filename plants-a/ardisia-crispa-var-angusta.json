It features slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value."
