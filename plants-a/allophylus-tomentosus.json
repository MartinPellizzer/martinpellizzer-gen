    "intro": "Allophylus tomentosus, commonly known as the hairy alder, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically opposite and covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, followed by drupes that are initially green and turn red when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and streamside areas. The hairy alder is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental qualities."
