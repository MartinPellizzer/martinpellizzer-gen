    "intro": "Alisma graminifolium f. terrestre, commonly known as the terrestrial arum, is a variant of the broadleaf water plantain. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist or wet environments, such as marshes and along stream banks. The plant features arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix enclosed by a spathe, typical of the Araceae family. This form is distinguished by its terrestrial growth habit, as opposed to the more aquatic forms of the species."
