    "intro": "Agalma multinervium, commonly known as the multivenous agalma, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. Agalma multinervium is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant morphology and adaptation to humid environments."
