    "intro": "Androsace villosa subsp. koso-poljanskii, commonly known as the Koso Poljansky androsace, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of the Balkans. It features dense, mat-forming growth with hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine white or gray pubescence. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
