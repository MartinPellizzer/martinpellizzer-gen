    "intro": "Aphelandra modesta, commonly known as the modest flame tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that produce bright orange or red flowers, which are highly attractive to pollinators. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are glossy and arranged oppositely along the stems. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Aphelandra modesta is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
