    "intro": "Agave ornata, commonly known as the Mexican weeping agave, is a striking succulent native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It features a rosette of long, narrow, blue-green leaves that are often adorned with white marginal teeth. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear small, yellowish-green flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Agave ornata is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and cold hardiness make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
