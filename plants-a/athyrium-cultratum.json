    "intro": "Athyrium cultratum, commonly known as the Japanese Painted Fern, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia. It features distinctive, finely divided, bi-colored foliage with a silvery underside and dark green upper surface. The plant produces upright, spore-bearing fertile fronds that are typically shorter than the sterile ones. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained, moist soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its elegant, feathery appearance and seasonal color changes."
