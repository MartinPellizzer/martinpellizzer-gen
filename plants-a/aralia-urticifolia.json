    "intro": "Aralia urticifolia, commonly known as stinging arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves that are palmately arranged, with serrated edges and a distinctive arrowhead shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clustered inflorescences, which are followed by bright red berries. Its stems and leaves are covered in fine hairs that can cause a stinging sensation upon contact. Aralia urticifolia thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
