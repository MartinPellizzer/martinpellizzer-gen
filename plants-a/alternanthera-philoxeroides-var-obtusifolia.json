    "intro": "Alternanthera philoxeroides var. obtusifolia, commonly known as red swamp crayfish plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking red or purple foliage, which becomes more vivid in low light conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are often overlooked. It is an invasive species in many regions, spreading rapidly through vegetative propagation. Its ability to thrive in wetland environments makes it a common weed in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats."
