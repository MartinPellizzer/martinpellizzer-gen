It produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has compact, succulent-like foliage that is often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Alyssum microcarpon is also valued for its ability to attract beneficial insects such as bees and ladybugs."
