    "intro": "Alnus incana f. acutiloba, commonly known as the sharpleaf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are finely toothed and often have a silvery underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or wetlands. This species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and improve nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems."
