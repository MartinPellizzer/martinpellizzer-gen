    "intro": "Astragalus terminalis var. reventoides, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife. Its ecological importance is significant in desert ecosystems due to its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
