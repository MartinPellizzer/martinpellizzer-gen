    "intro": "Androcalva leiperi, commonly known as the Leiper's sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Androcalva leiperi is often found in scrublands and rocky habitats, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
