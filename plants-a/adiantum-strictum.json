    "intro": "Adiantum strictum, commonly known as the rigid maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, upright growth habit. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori. Adiantum strictum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.",
