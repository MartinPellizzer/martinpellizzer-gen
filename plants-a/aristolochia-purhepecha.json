    "intro": "Aristolochia purhepecha, commonly known as the Mexican pipevine, is a climbing vine native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and its unique, pipe-like flowers that are often a deep purple or brownish color. The plant is part of the Aristolochiaceae family and is known for its complex, aromatic floral structures. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and the plant produces small, berry-like fruits that contain seeds. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated, though it can be toxic to humans and animals."
