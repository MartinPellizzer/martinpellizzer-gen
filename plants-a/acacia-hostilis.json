    "intro": "Acacia hostilis, commonly known as the hostile acacia, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like segments. Acacia hostilis is adapted to arid environments and has deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia hostilis is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in savannas and shrublands. This plant is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high temperatures and low rainfall. It plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species. Its distribution is largely restricted to the southwestern part of the African continent.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia hostilis was mainly introduced to control erosion and for its ornamental value in certain regions. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides where it thrives in dry, sandy environments. This plant has been reported in several states across the southwestern United States. However, it has also become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal make it both useful and problematic."
