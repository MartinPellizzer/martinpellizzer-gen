    "intro": "Amphidesmium rostratum, commonly known as the rostrated moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, mat-forming plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on soil or rock surfaces. The plant has a distinctive appearance, characterized by its dense, greenish-yellow foliage and the presence of a rostrum-like structure at the tips of its leaves. Amphidesmium rostratum is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Its simple morphology and ecological role make it an important component of microhabitats in forest understories."
