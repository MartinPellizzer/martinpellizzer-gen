    "intro": "Aria vulgaris, commonly known as the common tansy, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and is often found in meadows and disturbed soils. It produces small, dark seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
