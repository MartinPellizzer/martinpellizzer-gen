    "intro": "Albuca physodes, commonly known as the white-veined albuca, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves with distinctive white veins, and it produces clusters of pale yellow to white flowers during the summer months. The plant prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. It is relatively drought-tolerant once established, though it benefits from occasional watering during dry periods. Albuca physodes is valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation in warm climates."
