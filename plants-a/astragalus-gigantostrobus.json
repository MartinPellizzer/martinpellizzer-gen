    "intro": "Astragalus gigantostrobus, commonly known as the giant milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, and its compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and mountainous regions. Astragalus gigantostrobus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
