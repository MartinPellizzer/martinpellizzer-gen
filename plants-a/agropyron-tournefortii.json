    "intro": "Agropyron tournefortii, commonly known as the desert wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low rainfall and high temperatures. Agropyron tournefortii is often used for soil stabilization and as a forage plant in dryland ecosystems."
