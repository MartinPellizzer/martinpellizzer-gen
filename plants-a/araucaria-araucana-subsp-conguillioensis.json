    "intro": "Araucaria araucana subsp. conguillioensis, commonly known as the Huilliche Araucaria, is a coniferous tree native to southern Chile and southwestern Argentina. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of needle-like leaves and its conical shape. The species is closely related to the more widely known Araucaria araucana, but it exhibits distinct morphological and genetic differences. It thrives in temperate rainforests and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
