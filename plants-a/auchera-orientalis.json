    "intro": "Auchera orientalis, commonly known as the oriental bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early flowering habit and ability to thrive in cooler climates."
