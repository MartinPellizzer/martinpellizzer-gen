    "intro": "Ambrosia maritima, commonly known as sea ambrosia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is a perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in salt marshes and dunes. Ambrosia maritima is adapted to saline environments and plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
