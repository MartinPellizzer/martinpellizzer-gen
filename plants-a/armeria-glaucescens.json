    "intro": "Armeria glaucescens, commonly known as sea thrift, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It features dense clusters of bright white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, silver-gray foliage that is adapted to tolerate salt spray and sandy soils. It thrives in full sun and is often used in coastal landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value. Armeria glaucescens is also valued for its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion in coastal environments."
