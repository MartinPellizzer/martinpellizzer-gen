    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia erinacea var. microphylla is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and parts of South Africa. This variety is commonly found in sandy soils and rocky outcrops, often growing in shrubland and savanna ecosystems. It thrives in areas with low rainfall and high temperatures, adapting well to the harsh environmental conditions of its native habitat. The plant is known for its small, rounded leaves and yellow flowers, which contribute to its ecological and ornamental value. Due to its resilience, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia erinacea var. microphylla was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in sandy soils along the coast and in rocky areas. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of browse for livestock. It has also been introduced to other parts of southern Africa, including Namibia and Botswana. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it has spread beyond its original introduction sites."
