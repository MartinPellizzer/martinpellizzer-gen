    "intro": "Asclepias constricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that attract a variety of pollinators, including butterflies and bees. Its milky sap contains latex, which is toxic to some animals but beneficial for the monarch butterfly larvae. Asclepias constricta plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems and is often found in prairies and open woodlands."
