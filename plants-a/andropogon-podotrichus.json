    "intro": "Andropogon podotrichus, commonly known as the hairy bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy nodes, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Andropogon podotrichus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
