    "intro": "Astragalus adsurgens f. leucantha, commonly known as the white-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers clustered in racemes, which are followed by narrow, cylindrical pods. It is adapted to dry environments and has deep taproots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. This subspecies is distinguished by its pale or white flowers, setting it apart from other forms of Astragalus adsurgens."
