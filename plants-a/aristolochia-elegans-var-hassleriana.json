    "intro": "Aristolochia elegans var. hassleriana, commonly known as the yellow Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, pipe-shaped, yellowish-green flowers that resemble a hollow tube. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and emits a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor to attract its primary pollinators, which are flies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. The species is also noted for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
