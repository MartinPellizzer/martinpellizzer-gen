    "intro": "Aster ptarmicoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf aster, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, clustered blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces numerous tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind. Aster ptarmicoides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
