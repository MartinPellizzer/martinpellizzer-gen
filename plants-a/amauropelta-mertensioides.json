    "intro": "Amauropelta mertensioides, commonly known as the Mertens' shield fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy scales. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on the forest floor or on rocky substrates. Its fronds are evergreen and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, with a unique, creeping growth habit. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
