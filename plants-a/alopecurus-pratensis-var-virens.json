    "intro": "Alopecurus pratensis var. virens, commonly known as meadow foxtail, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist meadows, pastures, and damp woodlands, preferring well-drained to wet soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy, spike-like inflorescences that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution in temperate regions. Alopecurus pratensis var. virens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
