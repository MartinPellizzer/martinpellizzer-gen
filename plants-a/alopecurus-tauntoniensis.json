    "intro": "Alopecurus tauntoniensis, commonly known as Taunton's mouse-ear, is a rare grass species native to the United Kingdom. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often in woodland or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, and it produces small, greenish flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
