    "intro": "Artemisia tridentata subsp. tridentata, commonly known as sagebrush, is a shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-green foliage, which consists of aromatic, narrow, and often fuzzy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, and it is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Sagebrush plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
