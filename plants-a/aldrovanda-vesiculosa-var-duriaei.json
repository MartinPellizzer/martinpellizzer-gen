    "intro": "Aldrovanda vesiculosa var. duriaei, commonly known as the Duria's waterwheel plant, is a carnivorous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, snap-trap leaves that rapidly close around prey. The plant thrives in still, nutrient-poor freshwater environments, often found in ponds and wetlands. Its flowers are small and white, typically appearing in clusters, and it produces distinctive, bladder-like fruits. This variant is closely related to the common waterwheel plant but exhibits slight morphological differences in leaf structure and habitat preference."
