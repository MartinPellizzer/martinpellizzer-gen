    "intro": "Agropyron caninum var. dominii, commonly known as the Domin's needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It is well-suited to harsh environments due to its deep root system and drought tolerance. This grass is often found in steppes and rocky soils, contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitat."
