It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Its flowers are usually pink to purple in color and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Astragalus strigillosus is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for wildlife."
