    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha reticulata f. humblotiana is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich soil and adequate rainfall. This plant is commonly found in primary and secondary forests, as well as along riverbanks and in swampy habitats. It is often part of the undergrowth vegetation in these ecosystems. Its native distribution is closely linked to the biodiversity hotspots of the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha reticulata f. humblotiana was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant because of its vibrant leaf colors and unique texture. The plant thrives in warm climates with high humidity and partial to full sunlight. It is often used in landscape design to add visual interest to outdoor spaces. However, it is important to note that it may become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
