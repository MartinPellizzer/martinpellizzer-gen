    "intro": "Achyrocline turneri, commonly known as the Mexican blue sage, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. Achyrocline turneri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and blooms.",
