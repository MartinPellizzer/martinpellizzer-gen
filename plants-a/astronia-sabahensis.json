    "intro": "Astronia sabahensis, commonly known as the Sabah astronia, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Astronia sabahensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
