    "intro": "Allium gorumsense, commonly known as the Gorum onion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces bulbs that are often used in local cuisines for their pungent flavor. Its leaves are long and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained soils with full sunlight. Due to its limited distribution, Allium gorumsense is considered a rare and endemic species."
