    "intro": "Arctium monocephalum, commonly known as the common burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of purple flowers that develop into spiky, burs covered in hooked bracts, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often harvested for medicinal and culinary purposes. Arctium monocephalum is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
