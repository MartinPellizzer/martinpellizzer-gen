    "intro": "Asplenium pellucidum subsp. dareifolium, commonly known as the transparent holly fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to parts of Southeast Asia. It features delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive, translucent appearance on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, which are covered in a fine, hairy layer. The subspecies is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and is often found in humid, tropical climates."
