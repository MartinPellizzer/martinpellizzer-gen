    "intro": "Angolluma nubica, commonly known as the cloudshade fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing in shaded, rocky crevices. The plant features lance-shaped, bright green leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reflect sunlight and retain moisture. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, with spores produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, Angolluma nubica is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
