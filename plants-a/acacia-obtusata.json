    "intro": "Acacia obtusata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically narrow and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in spring. Acacia obtusata is adapted to dry environments and is often found in sandy soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia obtusata is primarily native to New South Wales. It is commonly found in the eastern regions of the state, particularly in areas with dry or semi-arid conditions. This plant typically grows in open woodlands, rocky outcrops, and along riverbanks. It is well adapted to the local climate and soil conditions of New South Wales. Acacia obtusata plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is often used in ecological restoration projects.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia obtusata was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and drought tolerance. It has since become naturalized in various regions, particularly in the North Island. The plant thrives in a range of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in invaded areas. Management strategies are being developed to control its spread and mitigate ecological impacts."
