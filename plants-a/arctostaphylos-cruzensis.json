It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with leathery, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in clusters, typically blooming in white or pink hues during the spring. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Arctostaphylos cruzensis is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal sage scrub habitats."
