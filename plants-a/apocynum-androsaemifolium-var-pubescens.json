It features upright, branched stems that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and also bear a pubescent texture, contributing to its overall soft feel. Its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers are typically pink or purple, blooming in summer, and are followed by orange or red berries. This plant is often found in moist soils along stream banks and in wetlands, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
