    "intro": "Acalypha reticulata f. vohitrae, commonly known as the Vohitra's nettle, is a rare and striking plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, often red or orange, bracts that surround its small flowers. The plant has palmate leaves with a distinctive reticulate pattern, giving it its species name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.",

It thrives in humid, shaded environments within these forests. The plant is known for its striking foliage and is often found in the understory of dense vegetation. Its native distribution is limited to specific regions in Madagascar, making it a rare and endemic species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha reticulata f. vohitrae was mainly introduced to Madagascar. It is a variant of the species Acalypha reticulata, which is native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. The introduction of this form to Madagascar is likely due to its ornamental value and adaptability to local conditions. It has been observed growing in disturbed habitats and along roadsides. However, its ecological impact and spread in the region are still being studied."
