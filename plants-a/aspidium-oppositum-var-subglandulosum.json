    "intro": "Aspidium oppositum var. subglandulosum, commonly known as the glandular water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnate fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The leaves are typically light green to bluish-green, with a distinctive glandular texture on the underside. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis."
