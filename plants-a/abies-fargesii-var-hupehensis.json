    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies fargesii var. hupehensis is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and western China, including the provinces of Sichuan, Hubei, and Shaanxi. It is commonly found in areas with high elevations, typically between 1,500 and 3,000 meters above sea level. This species thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils, often growing in mixed forests. It is particularly associated with the Hengduan Mountains and the eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. The plant is an important component of the temperate forest ecosystems in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies fargesii var. hupehensis was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and high elevations, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often cultivated in mountainous areas for its ornamental value and ecological benefits. This variety is particularly suited for reforestation projects due to its hardiness and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions. It has also been introduced to botanical gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide habitat for wildlife. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in non-native environments."
