    "intro": "Armeria maritima var. viciosoi, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a flowering plant native to the rocky coastlines of Europe and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in coastal dunes and cliffs. The plant produces dense clusters of white or pink flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. It is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal soils against erosion."
