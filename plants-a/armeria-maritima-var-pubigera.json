It is characterized by its dense, low-growing clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and sandy soils. It thrives in well-drained, sunny environments and is often found along shorelines and dunes. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for coastal gardens and erosion control."
