It features showy, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has basal leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, often with toothed margins. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for gardens and naturalized areas. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
