    "intro": "Anacamptis papilionacea var. balcanica, commonly known as the Balkan orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, butterfly-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing pink or purple flowers with a distinctive spurred lip. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
