    "intro": "Atraphaxis dumosa, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a low-growing shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep soil moisture. Atraphaxis dumosa is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils."
