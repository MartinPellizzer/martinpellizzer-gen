    "intro": "Aphyllorchis annamensis, commonly known as the Annam orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Vietnam. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a short, compact stem and a single, showy flower with intricate petal structures. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments, typically at high altitudes where it is exposed to specific microclimatic conditions. Its leaves are reduced to a few broad, leathery structures, which help conserve moisture in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Aphyllorchis annamensis is considered a threatened species, making it a subject of interest for conservation efforts."
