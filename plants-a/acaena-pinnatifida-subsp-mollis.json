This subspecies thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils. It is commonly associated with coastal dunes and shrublands. The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate and salt-laden winds of its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena pinnatifida subsp. mollis was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is commonly found in disturbed areas. It is now considered a weed in some regions due to its aggressive growth habit. However, it also provides habitat and food for native wildlife."
