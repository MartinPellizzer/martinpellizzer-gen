    "intro": "Alepyrum polygynum, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a compact rosette of basal leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Alepyrum polygynum is adapted to rocky and gravelly soils, thriving in high-altitude and arctic conditions."
