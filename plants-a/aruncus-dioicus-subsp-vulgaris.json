It features striking, feathery plumes of white or cream-colored flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, bipinnate leaves that are often used in ornamental gardening. It prefers moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
