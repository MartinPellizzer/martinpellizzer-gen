    "intro": "Aristida nealleyi, commonly known as Nealley's threeawn, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous bract-like florets. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ecological resilience."
