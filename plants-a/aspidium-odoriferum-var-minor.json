    "intro": "Aspidium odoriferum var. minor, commonly known as the sweet fern, is a lesser-known variant of the sweet fern species. It is a fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 30 centimeters in length. Its leaves are characterized by their finely divided, feathery structure, which gives it a unique, airy appearance. The plant is noted for its subtle, fragrant aroma, which becomes more pronounced when the fronds are crushed."
