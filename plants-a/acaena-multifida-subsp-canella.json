This subspecies thrives in various habitats, including forest margins, shrublands, and rocky areas. It is commonly associated with the lower and middle altitudes of the Southern Alps. The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate and nutrient-poor soils of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena multifida subsp. canella was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. This plant has since become naturalized and is now found in various habitats across the country. It is commonly associated with disturbed soils and open areas. However, it is not considered invasive and has not spread aggressively in the local ecosystem."
