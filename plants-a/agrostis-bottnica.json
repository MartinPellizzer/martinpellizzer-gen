    "intro": "Agrostis bottnica, commonly known as the northern bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in moist, cool climates and is often found in wet meadows, bogs, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny seeds. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments. Botanically, it is characterized by its rhizomatous growth and adaptability to nutrient-poor soils."
