    "intro": "Aconitum laciniatum var. fractiflexum, commonly known as the fragrant aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters at the top of tall, slender stems. The plant has finely dissected, fern-like leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a delicate and intricate appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets.",
