    "intro": "Apollonias barbujana, commonly known as the Barbujan's apollonia, is a rare and lesser-known flowering plant native to specific regions in southern Europe. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley, carrots, and dill, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and prefers partial to full shade, often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
