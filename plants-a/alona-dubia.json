    "intro": "Alona dubia, commonly known as the dwarf water flea, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Arthrophyceae. It is characterized by its tiny, floating fronds that resemble the limbs of crustaceans, giving it its common name. This plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Alona dubia is typically found in shallow waters with soft, muddy substrates. Its simple morphology and ecological role make it an important indicator species for water quality assessment."
