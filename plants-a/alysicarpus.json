    "intro": "Alysicarpus, commonly known as the \"cowpea grass,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are annual or perennial herbs native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plants typically have trifoliate leaves and produce small, pea-like flowers that are often white or pale pink. Alysicarpus species are characterized by their fibrous roots and the production of pods containing small, hard seeds. These plants are sometimes used in traditional medicine and as forage for livestock."
