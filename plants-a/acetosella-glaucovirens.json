    "intro": "Acetosella glaucovirens, commonly known as the silverleaf sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or reddish in color, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are edible and have a sour, tangy flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. Acetosella glaucovirens thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats.",
