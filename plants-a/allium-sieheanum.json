    "intro": "Allium sieheanum, commonly known as the Sierra onion, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of North America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, sweet flavor, making it a potential candidate for culinary use. Allium sieheanum is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
