    "intro": "Amygdalus persica alba, commonly known as the white peach tree, is a variety of peach that originates from the Prunus genus. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers that bloom in the spring, preceding the development of its fruit. The leaves are broad and oval-shaped, with a smooth texture and a slightly serrated edge. The fruit is typically smaller than the common peach, with a delicate skin and a sweet, juicy flesh. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often grown in gardens for both its beauty and edible yield."
