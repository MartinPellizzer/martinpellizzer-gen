    "intro": "Alyssum engelmannii, commonly known as Engelmann's alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and lavender. The plant features silver-gray foliage with fine, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is complemented by its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
