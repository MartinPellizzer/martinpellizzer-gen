It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, dark green, lobed leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces purple to pink flower heads that resemble thistles, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Aspalthium bituminosum is known for its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
