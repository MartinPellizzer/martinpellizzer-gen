    "intro": "Asplenium parallelum, commonly known as the parallel fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into small, linear segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds. Asplenium parallelum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its unique foliage."
