It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, bogs, and along stream banks. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f (tufted) growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
