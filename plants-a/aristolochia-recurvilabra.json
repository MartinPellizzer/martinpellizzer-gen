    "intro": "Aristolochia recurvilabra, commonly known as the curved-stemd Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, often unpleasant odor. The plant's leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are slender and often twining. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. The genus Aristolochia includes many species with similar morphological features and some with medicinal or toxic properties."
