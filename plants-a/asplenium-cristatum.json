    "intro": "Asplenium cristatum, commonly known as the crested maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a distinctive crinkled or curled appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. Asplenium cristatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant."
