    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelia chinensis var. ionandra is primarily native to Nansei-shoto, Taiwan. This variant of Abelia chinensis is found in the mountainous regions of Taiwan, where it thrives in humid, temperate climates. It is commonly associated with forest understories and rocky slopes in its native habitat. The plant is well adapted to the specific environmental conditions of the Nansei-shoto archipelago. Its native distribution is limited to these regions, making it a regionally significant species in Taiwanese flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia chinensis var. ionandra was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It was brought there for its ornamental value, particularly its fragrant, showy flowers. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun. It has become naturalized in some areas, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. Due to its adaptability, it is now commonly found in gardens and wetland environments across the region."
