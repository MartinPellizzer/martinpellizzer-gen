    "intro": "Aristolochia neolongifolia, commonly known as the long-leaf Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, serpentine-shaped flowers that are often greenish-yellow in color. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a glossy surface and has a climbing habit, often found in dense forest understories. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, and it contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals. Despite its medicinal uses in traditional medicine, it is considered a potentially harmful plant due to its toxic compounds."
