It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves with a glossy surface, often displaying vibrant green or variegated patterns. It thrives in high humidity and indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening.
