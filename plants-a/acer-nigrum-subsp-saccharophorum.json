    "intro": "Acer nigrum subsp. saccharophorum, commonly known as the black maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn vibrant yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by paired samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and reforestation efforts.",
