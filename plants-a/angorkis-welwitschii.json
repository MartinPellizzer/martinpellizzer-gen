    "intro": "Angorkis welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia mirabilis, is a unique plant native to the Namib Desert in Namibia. It is one of the oldest living seed plants, with a lineage dating back over 140 million years. The plant features a thick, woody trunk and large, leathery leaves that can grow up to three meters in length. It has a specialized root system that allows it to survive in arid conditions by absorbing moisture from deep underground. Its resilience and adaptation to extreme environments make it a remarkable example of botanical endurance."
