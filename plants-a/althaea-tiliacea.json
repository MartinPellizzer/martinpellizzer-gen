    "intro": "Althaea tiliacea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marshmallow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in moist, often wet environments such as marshes and riverbanks, preferring clay or loamy soils. The plant features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with heart-shaped, hairy leaves. Its showy, pale pink to white flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The mucilage-rich roots have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their soothing properties."
