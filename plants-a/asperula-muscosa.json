    "intro": "Asperula muscosa, commonly known as the creeping azalea, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features dense, dark green foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls along the stems. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, or red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ground cover in shaded gardens. Asperula muscosa is also valued for its ability to tolerate acidic soil conditions and its ornamental appeal."
