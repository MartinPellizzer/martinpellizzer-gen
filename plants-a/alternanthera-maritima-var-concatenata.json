    "intro": "Alternanthera maritima var. concatenata, commonly known as salt marsh cotton, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in saline environments. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in brackish or saltwater marshes, often forming dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its adaptability to high salinity and tidal fluctuations makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
