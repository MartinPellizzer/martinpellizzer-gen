    "intro": "Acrostichum glutinosum, commonly known as the sticky fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often covered in a sticky substance, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and swampy areas. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the wild.",
