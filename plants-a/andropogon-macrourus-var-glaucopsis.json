    "intro": "Andropogon macrourus var. glaucopsis, commonly known as the glaucous bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and southeastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant features narrow, bluish-green leaves and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are characteristic of the Andropogoneae tribe. Its foliage is often covered with a powdery, waxy coating, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. This grass is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in ecological restoration projects."
