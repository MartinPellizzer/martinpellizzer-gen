    "intro": "Acnistus lehmannii, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milky sap, which is toxic, is a distinguishing feature, and it is often used in traditional medicine. Acnistus lehmannii thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.",
