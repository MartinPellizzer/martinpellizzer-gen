    "intro": "Alchemilla intermedia, commonly known as lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late spring to early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of leafy stems. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties, and the plant is also valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in moist, shady conditions. Alchemilla intermedia is known for its ability to form dense mats, making it an effective ground cover in woodland gardens."
