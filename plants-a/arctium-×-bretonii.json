    "intro": "Arctium \u00d7 bretonii, commonly known as the European burdock, is a hybrid plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and purple-tan flowers that form composite heads. The plant produces burrs with hooked bracts, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. Native to Europe, it has been introduced to other regions and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its medicinal properties have been historically used in traditional remedies."
