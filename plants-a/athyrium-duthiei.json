    "intro": "Athyrium duthiei, commonly known as the Duthie's brake, is a fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a membranous covering. Athyrium duthiei is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
