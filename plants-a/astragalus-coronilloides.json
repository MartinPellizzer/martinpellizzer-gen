    "intro": "Astragalus coronilloides, commonly known as the crownless milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, lens-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Astragalus coronilloides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
