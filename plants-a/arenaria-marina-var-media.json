It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. The plant typically has small, fleshy leaves that help retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are usually white or pink, appearing in clusters during the summer months. It plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion."
