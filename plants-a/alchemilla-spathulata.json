    "intro": "Alchemilla spathulata, commonly known as broad-leaved lady\u2019s mantle, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe. It features a dense mat of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla spathulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet habitats."
