    "intro": "Armeria cariensis, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a flowering plant native to the rocky coastal areas of southern California and Baja California. It is a low-growing perennial that produces dense clusters of white or pinkish flowers in spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for coastal gardens. Armeria cariensis is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in harsh maritime environments."
