    "intro": "Anarrhinum forskaohlii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its deep root system and succulent leaves that store water. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Anarrhinum forskaohlii plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing limited forage for desert wildlife."
