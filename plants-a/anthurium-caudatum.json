    "intro": "Anthurium caudatum, commonly known as the curly tail anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that have a velvety texture and a deep green color. The plant produces bright red spathes that enclose a spadix, which is a dense cluster of tiny flowers. Anthurium caudatum thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light. It is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and unique flowering structure."
