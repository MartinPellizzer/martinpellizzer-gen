    "intro": "Anthriscus sylvestris subsp. mollis, commonly known as smooth woodland parsley, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are soft to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white, umbellate flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its delicate appearance makes it a desirable addition to gardens with a naturalistic style."
