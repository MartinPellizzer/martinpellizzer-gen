    "intro": "Alchemilla colorata subsp. lapeyrousii, commonly known as the Lapeyrouse's lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that is covered in soft, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh, alpine conditions."
