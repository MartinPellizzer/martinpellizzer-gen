    "intro": "Acacia prismifolia, commonly known as the diamond acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, slender, triangular-shaped phyllodes that give it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular heads, which are typically visited by a variety of pollinators. Acacia prismifolia is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it resilient in harsh environments. Its wood is hard and durable, historically used by indigenous communities for tool-making and construction.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia prismifolia is primarily native to Western Australia. It is found in the southern and western regions of the state, particularly in the areas of the Geraldton and Kalgoorlie regions. This species typically grows in sandy soils and is commonly found in coastal and inland areas. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range. The plant is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia prismifolia was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has been widely planted for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid conditions. It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides, particularly in the Western and Eastern Cape provinces. The plant's rapid growth and adaptability have made it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with low rainfall. However, its invasive potential has raised concerns due to its ability to outcompete native vegetation. Despite its benefits, management strategies are being developed to control its spread in sensitive ecosystems."
