    "intro": "Arenaria barbata, commonly known as the sandspoon, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with hairy, succulent stems and leaves. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine, barbed hairs, which give it its scientific name. Arenaria barbata is adapted to cold, dry environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
