    "intro": "Asplenium raddii, commonly known as the rock spleenwort, is a small evergreen fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. This plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium raddii is well adapted to rocky habitats and is often found in temperate regions across the Northern Hemisphere."
