    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abrus acutifolius is primarily native to southern and eastern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and Tanzania. It is commonly found in dry, open woodlands, savannas, and along riverbanks. The plant thrives in regions with a warm, temperate to subtropical climate. It is often seen growing on rocky soils and in disturbed habitats. Due to its adaptability, it has also been introduced to other parts of the world, including parts of Asia and the Americas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrus acutifolius was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in warm, humid environments. It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils, often growing as a shrub or small tree. The plant has been introduced to parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and some regions of the Americas. Its introduction is largely due to its ornamental value and use in traditional medicine. However, it is considered an invasive species in certain areas, outcompeting native vegetation."
