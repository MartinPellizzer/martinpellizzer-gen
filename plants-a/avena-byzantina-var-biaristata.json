    "intro": "Avena byzantina var. biaristata, commonly known as the Armenian oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caucasus region. It features slender, tufted stems with long, narrow leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous spikelets, each with two to three bracts. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution. This plant is often found in rocky or dry habitats and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
