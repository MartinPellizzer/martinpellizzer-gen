    "intro": "Aleuritopteris grisea, commonly known as the gray cliff fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are often grayish in color, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Aleuritopteris grisea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
