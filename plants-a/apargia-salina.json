    "intro": "Apargia salina, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of the United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its ability to thrive in saline and coastal environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with a fine layer of salt crystals, which help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Apargia salina plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion along shorelines. Its unique adaptations make it an essential component of coastal ecosystems."
