    "intro": "Aristida riparia, commonly known as rivergrass or watergrass, is a perennial grass native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshes, stream banks, and other moist environments, where it forms dense, tufted clumps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often clustered at the tips of the stems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in riparian zones. Aristida riparia is valued for its ecological role in preventing erosion and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
