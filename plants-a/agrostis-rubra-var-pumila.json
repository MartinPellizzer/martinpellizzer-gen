    "intro": "Agrostis rubra var. pumila, commonly known as the cushion bentgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, narrow leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to reddish flowers, which are typically short-lived. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
