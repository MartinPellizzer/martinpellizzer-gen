    "intro": "Arabis rigida, commonly known as rigid rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, white or yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and has a low, compact growth habit. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of hair, helping to reduce water loss in cold, harsh environments. Arabis rigida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
