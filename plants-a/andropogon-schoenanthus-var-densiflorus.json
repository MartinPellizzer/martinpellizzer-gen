    "intro": "Andropogon schoenanthus var. densiflorus, commonly known as the denseflower bluestem, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dense clusters of small blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. This variant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
