    "intro": "Athrotaxis alpina, commonly known as the alpine she-oak, is a small evergreen tree native to the cool, moist forests of southeastern Australia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and small, cup-shaped flowers. The plant is adapted to thrive in shaded, nutrient-poor soils, which is typical of its habitat in mountainous regions. Athrotaxis alpina plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing shelter and food for various native wildlife species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
