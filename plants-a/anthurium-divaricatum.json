It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are dark green with a prominent red or purple vein. The plant produces spadices, which are specialized inflorescences that are typically green with a showy, colorful spathe. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires indirect light for optimal growth. Anthurium divaricatum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
