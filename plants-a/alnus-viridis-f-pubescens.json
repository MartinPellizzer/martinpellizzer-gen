    "intro": "Alnus viridis f. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent alder, is a shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish bark and alternate, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or wetlands. This species is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration projects."
