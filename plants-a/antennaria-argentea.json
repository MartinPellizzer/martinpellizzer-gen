    "intro": "Antennaria argentea, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense, silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight, helping it thrive in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, which are arranged in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Antennaria argentea is often found in open habitats such as meadows, dunes, and disturbed soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing the ground and supporting local biodiversity."
