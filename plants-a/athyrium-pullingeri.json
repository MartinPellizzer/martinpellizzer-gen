    "intro": "Athyrium pullingeri, commonly known as the Chinese maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Athyrium pullingeri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
