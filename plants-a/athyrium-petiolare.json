    "intro": "Athyrium petiolare, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Japanese shield fern, is a deciduous fern native to East Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, spore-bearing clusters called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and indoor cultivation."
