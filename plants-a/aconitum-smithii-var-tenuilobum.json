    "intro": "Aconitum smithii var. tenuilobum, commonly known as the slender-lobed monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features striking purple to blue spires of flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has dark green, heart-shaped leaves with deeply lobed margins, giving it a distinctive appearance. It prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in gardens.",
