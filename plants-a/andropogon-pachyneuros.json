    "intro": "Andropogon pachyneuros, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, bluish-green leaves and compact growth habit, making it well-suited for prairie and woodland habitats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and establish dense stands. Andropogon pachyneuros plays an important role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife."
