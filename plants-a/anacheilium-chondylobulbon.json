    "intro": "Anacheilium chondylobulbon, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a slender, upright stem with lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires partial shade to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
