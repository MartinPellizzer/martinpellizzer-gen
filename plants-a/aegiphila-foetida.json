    "intro": "Aegiphila foetida, commonly known as the stinking beggar's-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, and it has distinctive, aromatic leaves that emit a strong, unpleasant odor. Its roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Aegiphila foetida plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
