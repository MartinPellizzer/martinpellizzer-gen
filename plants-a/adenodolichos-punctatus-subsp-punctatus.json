It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces elongated, narrow pods that contain several small, dark brown seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant.",
