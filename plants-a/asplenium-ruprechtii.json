    "intro": "Asplenium ruprechtii, commonly known as the rock spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often dark green with a slightly glossy texture. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rocky surfaces or in crevices where it can anchor itself securely. Its rhizomes are short and help it spread slowly through vegetative reproduction. Asplenium ruprechtii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging garden conditions."
