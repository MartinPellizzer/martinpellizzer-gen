It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Arnica merriamii is part of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and has a compact growth habit. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
