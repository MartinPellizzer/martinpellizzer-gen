    "intro": "Asclepias fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Asclepias fimbriata is a host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing essential nourishment for monarch caterpillars. Its latex sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals but serve as a defense mechanism."
