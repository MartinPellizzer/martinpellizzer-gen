    "intro": "Alopecurus alpinus var. borealis, commonly known as the Arctic toothgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to cold, alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features fine, hair-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions such as strong winds and low temperatures. Its morphology reflects evolutionary strategies for survival in high-altitude ecosystems. Botanically, it is characterized by its compact growth habit and specialized reproductive structures suited for its ecological niche."
