    "intro": "Aegilops variabilis var. planispicula, commonly known as the slender wild rye, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and sandy soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
