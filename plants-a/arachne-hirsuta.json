    "intro": "Arachne hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy arachnoid, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Arachne hirsuta is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its hairy foliage helps reduce water loss and provides some protection against herbivores."
