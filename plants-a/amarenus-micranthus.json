    "intro": "Amarenus micranthus, commonly known as the small-flowered amaranth, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, lance-shaped leaves, and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant produces small, triangular seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to thrive in arid environments. Amarenus micranthus is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in dry, open habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities."
