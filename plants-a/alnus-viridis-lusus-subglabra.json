    "intro": "Alnus viridis lusus subglabra, commonly known as the smooth-leaf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are smooth and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by spherical cones that mature in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or wetlands. This species is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in ecological restoration projects."
