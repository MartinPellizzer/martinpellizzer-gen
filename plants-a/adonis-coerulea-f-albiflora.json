    "intro": "Adonis coerulea f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered azure globemallow, is a rare and striking plant native to the high alpine regions of the European Alps. It belongs to the family Papaveraceae, which includes poppies and other flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant features a compact, low-growing habit with dark green, hairy leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that contrast vividly with its blue-green foliage. Its flowers are typically tubular with five petals, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous small, dark seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",
