    "intro": "Alsophila cyclodonta, commonly known as the cyclosperma fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in ideal conditions. Its rhizome is thick and woody, providing structural support, while its fronds are typically evergreen and can persist for several years. Alsophila cyclodonta is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and along riverbanks."
