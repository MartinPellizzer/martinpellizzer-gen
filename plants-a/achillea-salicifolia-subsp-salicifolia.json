    "intro": "Achillea salicifolia subsp. salicifolia, commonly known as the willow-leaved yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features basal rosettes of linear, willow-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers in late summer. The plant is characterized by its aromatic foliage, which emits a subtle, herbaceous scent when crushed. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This subspecies is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.",
