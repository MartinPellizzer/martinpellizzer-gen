    "intro": "Arthratherum plumosum var. floccosum, commonly known as the fluffy hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, silky, hair-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
