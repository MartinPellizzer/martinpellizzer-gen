It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variety is often found in alpine and subarctic habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
