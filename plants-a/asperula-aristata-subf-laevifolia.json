It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and glossy, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, dark blue berries. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
