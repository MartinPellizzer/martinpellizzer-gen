    "intro": "Avena murphyi, commonly known as Murphy's oat, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets. The plant typically thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps reduce water loss. Avena murphyi is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
