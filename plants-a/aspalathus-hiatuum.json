    "intro": "Aspalathus hiatuum, commonly known as the small-leaved rooibos, is a member of the Fabaceae family and is native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is a small, shrub-like plant characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is known for its unique ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat. Aspalathus hiatuum is closely related to the more well-known rooibos (Aspalathus linearis) and shares similar ecological and botanical traits. Its cultivation is limited due to its specific environmental requirements and lower yield compared to other rooibos varieties."
