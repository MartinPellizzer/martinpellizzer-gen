    "intro": "Aceratium obtusidens, commonly known as the blunt-leafed dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a single, upright stem that bears a cluster of yellow flowers, which later develop into fluffy seeds for wind dispersal. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in dry, sunny environments. Aceratium obtusidens is often found in rocky soils and is considered a hardy weed in some areas.",
