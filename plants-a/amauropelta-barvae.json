It is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, featuring elongated, narrow fronds with a complex arrangement of pinnae. The plant exhibits a creeping growth habit, often forming dense mats on the forest floor. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds.
