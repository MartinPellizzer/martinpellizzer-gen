    "intro": "Arctium \u00d7 subracemosum, commonly known as the common burdock, is a hybrid perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense, spiky burrs that contain seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by attachment to animals or clothing. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and urban environments."
