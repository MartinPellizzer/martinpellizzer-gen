It thrives in coastal and lowland areas with warm, humid climates. It is commonly seen in open woodlands and along the shores. The species is an important part of the local flora and ecosystem in Samoa.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon whistleri was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast. It has been established in disturbed areas such as roadsides, open woods, and wetlands. The plant is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively. It thrives in a variety of soil types and can tolerate both wet and dry conditions. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns as it competes with native vegetation."
