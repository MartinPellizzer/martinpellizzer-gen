    "intro": "Astragalus gossypinus, commonly known as the cottonleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its hairy stems, compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, round pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, and is often found in disturbed areas. Astragalus gossypinus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife."
