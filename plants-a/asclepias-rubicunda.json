    "intro": "Asclepias rubicunda, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking red-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many animals but serve as a defense mechanism. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Asclepias rubicunda plays a vital role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing a host plant for their larvae."
