    "intro": "Astragalus leptynticus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and pinnately compound, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus leptynticus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
