    "intro": "Askidiosperma insigne, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its straight, dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and fine grain. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth surface. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by winged fruits. Due to its slow growth and high demand, the species is now considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
