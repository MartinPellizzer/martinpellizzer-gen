    "intro": "Antidesma bunius var. cordifolium, commonly known as the heartleaf antidesma, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptic to heart-shaped leaves that are often arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or secondary forests. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local medicine."
