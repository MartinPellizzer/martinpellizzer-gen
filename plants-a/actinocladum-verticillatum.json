    "intro": "Actinocladum verticillatum, commonly known as the whorled sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, with its stems spreading horizontally along the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that are clustered in whorls around the stem, giving it its scientific name. Its leaves are generally linear and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in full sun and exhibiting drought tolerance.",
