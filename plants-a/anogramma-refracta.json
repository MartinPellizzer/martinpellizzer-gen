    "intro": "Anogramma refracta, commonly known as the brittle spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Pterobryaceae and is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are often divided into two parts. The plant produces spores in capsules that are typically clustered in groups of three, a feature that distinguishes it from other fern species. It is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in humid, temperate regions. Anogramma refracta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
