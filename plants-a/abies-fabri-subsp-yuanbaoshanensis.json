    "intro": "Abies fabri subsp. yuanbaoshanensis, commonly known as Yuanbaoshan fir, is a rare and endemic coniferous species native to China. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces small, cylindrical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in cool, moist climates at high altitudes, typically in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts.",

This subspecies is found in the Yuanbaoshan area, which is part of the larger Hengduan Mountains range. It grows in high-altitude forests at elevations ranging from approximately 2,500 to 3,500 meters. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils. Its restricted distribution makes it a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies fabri subsp. yuanbaoshanensis was mainly introduced to the southern regions of China, particularly in the Yunnan and Guizhou provinces. It thrives in high-altitude areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils. This subspecies is notable for its unique morphological characteristics, including its dense foliage and conical shape. It has been cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas to preserve its genetic diversity. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it has become a subject of interest for researchers and horticulturists."
