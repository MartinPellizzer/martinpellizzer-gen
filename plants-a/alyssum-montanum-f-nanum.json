    "intro": "Alyssum montanum f. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf alpine alyssum, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant characterized by its compact stature and dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. The plant typically features gray-green, hairy leaves and produces yellow or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens and rockeries for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in cooler climates."
