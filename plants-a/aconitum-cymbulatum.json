    "intro": "Aconitum cymbulatum, commonly known as the cymbulatum monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking violet-blue flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape, characteristic of the genus Aconitum. The plant has dark green, palmately lobed leaves that are typically hairy and aromatic. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.",
