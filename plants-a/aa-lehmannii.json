    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Aa lehmannii is primarily native to Ecuador. It is found in the western regions of the country, particularly in the Andean foothills. This plant thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soils. It is commonly found in cloud forests and lowland areas. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Ecuador.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Aa lehmannii was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It is commonly found in coastal areas and along the edges of forests where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This plant is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate mild frost. It has also been introduced to other regions with similar climatic conditions, such as parts of the Pacific Northwest. However, its spread is generally limited by its specific environmental requirements."
