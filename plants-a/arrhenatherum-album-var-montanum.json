It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, leafless stems that bear panicle-like inflorescences with white to pale green florets. Its foliage is characterized by narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
