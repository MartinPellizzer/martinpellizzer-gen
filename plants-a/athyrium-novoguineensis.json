    "intro": "Athyrium novoguineensis, commonly known as the New Guinea serrated wood fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with serrated edges. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in high humidity. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which helps anchor it to the soil and absorb nutrients. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle in the wild."
