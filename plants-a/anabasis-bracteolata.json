    "intro": "Anabasis bracteolata, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with succulent, fleshy stems that store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Anabasis bracteolata plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
