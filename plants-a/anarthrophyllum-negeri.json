It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, white flowers. The plant produces woody fruits that contain small, hard seeds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in lowland and hill forest areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
