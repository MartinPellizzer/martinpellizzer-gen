    "intro": "Asplenium erosum var. erosum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spleenwort, is a fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or forest floors. The plant has lance-shaped, glossy leaves that are often clustered at the base, with a dark green color and a slightly serrated margin. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. This variety is notable for its delicate appearance and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
