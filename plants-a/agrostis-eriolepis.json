    "intro": "Agrostis eriolepis, commonly known as the fineleaf bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 mm wide. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. Agrostis eriolepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass applications."
