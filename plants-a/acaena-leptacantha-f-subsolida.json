    "intro": "Acaena leptacantha f. subsolida, commonly known as the slender hooked burr, is a variant of the Acaena genus native to New Zealand. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces distinctive, hooked bracts that enclose its tiny, dark berries, which are adapted for animal dispersal. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. This subspecies thrives in coastal and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife.",

This subspecies thrives in coastal and lowland environments. It is commonly associated with sandy soils and open habitats. The plant is part of the rose family and is known for its small, spiny fruits.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena leptacantha f. subsolida was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. This plant is commonly found in coastal and subantarctic regions. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often seen in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it has become naturalized in several areas of the country."
