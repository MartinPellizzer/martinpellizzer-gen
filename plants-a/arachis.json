    "intro": "Arachis, commonly known as the peanut, is a leguminous plant native to South America. It produces its fruit underground, a unique characteristic among plants, which is why it is often referred to as a \"groundnut.\" The plant has compound leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that develop into pods containing the edible seeds. Arachis is valued for its high oil content and is a significant crop in agriculture. It also has the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting other plants in the ecosystem."
