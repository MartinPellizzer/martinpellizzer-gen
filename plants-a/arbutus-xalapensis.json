    "intro": "Arbutus xalapensis, commonly known as the Madrona or Buckthorn, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces edible berries that are dark purple to black in color, often used in traditional medicine and culinary practices. Its leaves are thick, leathery, and have a distinctive waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Arbutus xalapensis is well adapted to coastal and mountainous regions, often forming dense thickets in disturbed soils."
