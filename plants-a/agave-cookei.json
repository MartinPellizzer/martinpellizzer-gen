    "intro": "Agave cookei, commonly known as the Cook's agave, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a succulent plant with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk with yellow flowers, which appears after several years of growth. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Agave cookei is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
