    "intro": "Aconitum japonicum, commonly known as Japanese monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features striking, helmet-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has dark green, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
