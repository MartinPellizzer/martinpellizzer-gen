    "intro": "Alnaster firmus, commonly known as the rigid alnaster, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant has dark green, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. Alnaster firmus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
