    "intro": "Andropogon glaucus, commonly known as bluestem grass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its blue-gray foliage and tufted inflorescence, which consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle. The plant typically grows in prairie and woodland habitats, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and have a distinctive blue-green color, which becomes more pronounced in dry conditions. Andropogon glaucus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects."
