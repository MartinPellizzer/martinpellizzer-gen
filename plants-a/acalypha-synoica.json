This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often associated with disturbed soils and open habitats. The species is well adapted to the environmental conditions of these regions. It plays an important ecological role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha synoica was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of cultivation. It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since spread throughout various regions of the country. The plant thrives in a wide range of soil types and is commonly found in both urban and rural environments. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands have led to concerns about its potential invasiveness. Despite its ornamental value, it is now considered a potential weed in some areas of New Zealand."
