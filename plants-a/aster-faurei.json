It is characterized by its soft blue-gray foliage and clusters of small, daisy-like white to blue flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators. Aster faurei is also valued for its ability to grow in a variety of soil types and its low maintenance requirements."
