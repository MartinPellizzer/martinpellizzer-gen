    "intro": "Asclepias eximia, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the United States. It is characterized by its striking pink to red flowers and hairy, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many animals but serve as a defense mechanism. It plays a vital role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae. Asclepias eximia thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, prairies, and disturbed soils."
