    "intro": "Astragalus rupicola, commonly known as the rock milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets. Astragalus rupicola is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, with deep roots that help it access water and nutrients in nutrient-poor soils."
