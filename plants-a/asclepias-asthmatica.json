    "intro": "Asclepias asthmatica, commonly known as the asthma milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, which can be toxic if ingested. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a rough texture, while its stems are often hairy and can grow up to several feet in height. This species plays an important role in supporting the life cycle of the monarch butterfly, as it serves as a host plant for their larvae."
