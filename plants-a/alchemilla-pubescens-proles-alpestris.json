    "intro": "Alchemilla pubescens proles alpestris, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features a dense rosette of soft, hairy, silver-green leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are clustered in loose, open inflorescences. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their soothing properties. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates."
