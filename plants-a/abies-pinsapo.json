    "intro": "Abies pinsapo, commonly known as the Spanish fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in spirals. The tree produces cones that are cylindrical and contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions. Abies pinsapo plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting a variety of wildlife and contributing to forest ecosystems.",

It is found in the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula, particularly in the Sierra Nevada and other high-altitude areas. This species thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soils. It is a relict species, meaning it has survived from a time when its range was more extensive. The plant is adapted to the specific climatic conditions of southern Spain.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies pinsapo was mainly introduced to Austria and Portugal. This species is native to the Iberian Peninsula but has been cultivated in these European countries. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in temperate climates. The introduction has contributed to biodiversity in these regions. However, it requires specific soil and climate conditions to flourish successfully."
