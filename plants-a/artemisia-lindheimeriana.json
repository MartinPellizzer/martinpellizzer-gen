    "intro": "Artemisia lindheimeriana, commonly known as Lindheimer's sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and silver-white, feathery leaves that are densely covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it a hardy and drought-tolerant plant often used in xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
