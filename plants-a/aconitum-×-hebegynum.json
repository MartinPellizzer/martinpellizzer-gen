    "intro": "Aconitum \u00d7 hebegynum, commonly known as the hybrid aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Aconitum napellus and Aconitum lycoctonum, resulting in a plant with striking blue to purple flowers. The plant features large, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its toxic nature, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets.",
