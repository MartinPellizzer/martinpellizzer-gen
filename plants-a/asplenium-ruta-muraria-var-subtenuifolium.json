    "intro": "Asplenium ruta-muraria var. subtenuifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock spleenwort, is a fern native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant that typically grows on rock surfaces or tree trunks. The leaves are lanceolate, with a slender, elongated shape and a dark green, glossy appearance. It produces spores in compact, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is noted for its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments, making it a common sight in woodland and rocky habitats."
