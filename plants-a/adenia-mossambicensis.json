    "intro": "Adenia mossambicensis, commonly known as the Mozambique adenium, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to store water, making it well-suited for arid environments. The plant produces striking orange-red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens. However, it requires well-draining soil and protection from frost to thrive.",
