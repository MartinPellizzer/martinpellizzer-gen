    "intro": "Azorella spinosa, commonly known as the Andean cushion plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to the high Andes of South America, where it thrives in cold, arid environments. The plant forms dense, low-growing cushions composed of tightly packed stems and leaves, which help it conserve moisture and withstand harsh weather conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in shades of white or pink. Azorella spinosa is adapted to high-altitude ecosystems and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
