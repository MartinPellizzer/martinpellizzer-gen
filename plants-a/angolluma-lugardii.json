    "intro": "Angolluma lugardii, commonly known as the African rock orchid, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in sunny, arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
