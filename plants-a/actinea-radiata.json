    "intro": "Actinea radiata, commonly known as the star anemone, is a marine invertebrate belonging to the order Actinaria. It is characterized by its delicate, flower-like crown of flexible, feather-like tentacles surrounding a central mouth. This species is typically found in shallow coastal waters, where it attaches itself to rocky substrates using a basal disc. The tentacles are used for capturing plankton and other small organisms, which are then brought to the mouth for consumption. Its translucent, radial symmetry and vibrant colors make it a visually striking component of marine ecosystems.",
