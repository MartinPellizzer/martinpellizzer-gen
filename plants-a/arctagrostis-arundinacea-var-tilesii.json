    "intro": "Arctagrostis arundinacea var. tilesii, commonly known as the coastal panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern coast of North America. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and tufted inflorescences that produce small, pale green to brown spikelets. This variety is adapted to sandy, coastal soils and can tolerate salt spray and wind, making it a hardy plant in maritime environments. It often forms dense mats, contributing to erosion control and stabilizing dunes. The plant is widely used in coastal restoration projects due to its resilience and ecological benefits."
