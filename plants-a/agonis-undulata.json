    "intro": "Agonis undulata, commonly known as the undulating agonis, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a glossy green, with a slightly wavy or undulating edge, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in spring, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to dry, coastal environments. Agonis undulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its hardy nature and drought tolerance."
