It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive foliage. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its flowers are typically small, yellowish, and arranged in clusters.

Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
