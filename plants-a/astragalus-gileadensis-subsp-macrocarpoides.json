    "intro": "Astragalus gileadensis subsp. macrocarpoides, commonly known as the Gilead milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and often dispersed by wind. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in its native habitat."
