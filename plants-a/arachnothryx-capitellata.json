It has small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which contribute to its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are fleshy berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. Botanically, it belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its unique symbiotic relationship with its host."
