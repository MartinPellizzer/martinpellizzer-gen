    "intro": "Aromadendron maingayi, commonly known as the Philippine sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its fragrance. The plant has simple, alternate leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by small, round fruits. It is often found in lowland and montane forests, growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to overharvesting, it is considered an endangered species and is protected in several regions."
