    "intro": "Artemisia palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's sagebrush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and aromatic scent, which is due to the presence of volatile oils. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils and open habitats. It produces small, yellowish flower clusters that bloom in the summer months. Artemisia palmeri plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species."
