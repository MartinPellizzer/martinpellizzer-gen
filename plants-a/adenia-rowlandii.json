    "intro": "Adenia rowlandii, commonly known as the giant rat's tail plant, is a striking tropical shrub native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, serpentine stems that can grow up to 15 meters in length, making it one of the most distinctive plants in the Adenaceae family. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, pinkish-white flowers with a strong, sweet scent. Its unique morphology and ornamental value make it a popular specimen in botanical gardens. However, it is also considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation.",
