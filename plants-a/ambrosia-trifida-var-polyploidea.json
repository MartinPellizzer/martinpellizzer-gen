    "intro": "Ambrosia trifida var. polyploidea, commonly known as the giant ragweed, is a herbaceous annual plant native to North America. It is characterized by its large, triangular leaves and yellow-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is wind-pollinated and produces copious amounts of lightweight seeds that are dispersed over long distances. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in agricultural fields. Due to its allergenic pollen, it is considered a significant weed in many regions."
