    "intro": "Astragalus tribuloides var. leiocarpus, commonly known as the smoothpod milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring. Its fruit is a slender pod that remains closed until maturity, releasing seeds when disturbed. This species is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
