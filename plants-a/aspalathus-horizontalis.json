    "intro": "Aspalathus horizontalis, commonly known as the African Geranium, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant features small, delicate flowers that range in color from pink to red, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid native environment. Aspalathus horizontalis is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
