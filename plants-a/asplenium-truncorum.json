It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices, walls, and forest floors. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often cut or notched at the tips, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a velvety texture. Asplenium truncorum reproduces via spores and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in compact spaces."
