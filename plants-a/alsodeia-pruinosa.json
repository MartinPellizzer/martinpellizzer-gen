    "intro": "Alsodeia pruinosa, commonly known as the silverleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features a compact, mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its succulent leaves and drought-resistant nature make it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Alsodeia pruinosa is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along dry streambeds and rocky outcrops."
