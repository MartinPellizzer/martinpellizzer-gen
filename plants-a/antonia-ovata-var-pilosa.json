    "intro": "Antonia ovata var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy antonia, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, soft-textured appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly serrated edge and a thick, leathery texture. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
