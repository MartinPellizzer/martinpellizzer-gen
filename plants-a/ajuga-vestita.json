    "intro": "Ajuga vestita, commonly known as carpet bugle or silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, oval leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Ajuga vestita is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
