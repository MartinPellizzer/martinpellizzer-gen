    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum var. pulcher, commonly known as purple top millet, is a warm-season grass native to Africa and widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and striking purple-tinted leaf blades that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains, making it a valuable crop for forage and grain. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for marginal agricultural lands. Its botanical features make it an important species in both traditional farming systems and ecological restoration projects."
