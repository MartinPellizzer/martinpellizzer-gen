    "intro": "Angiopteris formosa, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its fronds are typically divided into numerous pinnae, which are feather-like in appearance. Angiopteris formosa plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic ecosystems."
