    "intro": "Amorphophallus terrestris, commonly known as the giant swamp taro, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces a striking, purple-pink spadix surrounded by a white spathe, which resembles a giant, dramatic flower. It thrives in wet, swampy environments and is often found in marshes and along riverbanks. The underground corm is edible when properly prepared, though it contains calcium oxalate crystals that can be irritating if not cooked thoroughly."
