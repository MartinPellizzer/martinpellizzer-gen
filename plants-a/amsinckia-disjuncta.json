    "intro": "Amsinckia disjuncta, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It has a deep taproot system, allowing it to survive in arid and sandy environments. Amsinckia disjuncta is adapted to full sun and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in desert scrub habitats."
