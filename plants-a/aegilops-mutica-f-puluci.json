    "intro": "Aegilops mutica f. puluci, commonly known as the rough spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy, slender stems and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, awned spikelets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and along roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and have a rough texture, contributing to its common name. This species is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential as a forage crop and its genetic relationship to wheat."
