It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and lanceolate, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its underground tubers are used as a starchy food source, similar to traditional arrowroot. Botanically, it belongs to the family Araceae, which includes many aquatic and semi-aquatic plants."
