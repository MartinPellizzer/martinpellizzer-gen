    "intro": "Acalypha inaequilatera, commonly known as the unequal-veined spurflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that often resemble flowers. The plant features palmate leaves with irregularly arranged veins, giving it its scientific name. It produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Acalypha inaequilatera is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha inaequilatera is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forest understories or along riverbanks. It is also present in parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands. Its native range extends across various islands in the Indo-Pacific region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha inaequilatera was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was likely brought there by human activity, such as horticultural trade or intentional planting for aesthetic purposes. The plant has since become naturalized in some areas, spreading through seed dispersal by wind, water, or animals. It is considered an invasive species in certain regions because of its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact."
