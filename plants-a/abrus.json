    "intro": "Abrus, commonly known as the Indian satin flower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. The most well-known species, Abrus precatorius, is characterized by its striking red and white ornamental pods. The seeds of this plant contain a potent toxin called abrin, which makes them highly dangerous if ingested. Due to their toxic properties, Abrus plants are often grown as ornamentals rather than for consumption."
