    "intro": "Anoectochilus brevistylis, commonly known as the short-styled orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and produces pale green to white flowers with short, slender petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on the forest floor or on tree trunks. Its leaves are usually elliptical and covered with a fine, velvety texture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
