    "intro": "Astragalus confertiflorus var. flaviflorus, commonly known as the yellow-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and rocky slopes. The plant features compound leaves with numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces clusters of yellow to orange flowers. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soils in dry environments."
