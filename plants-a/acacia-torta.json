    "intro": "Acacia torta, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, twisted branches and feathery, bipinnate leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and often has a silvery sheen, contributing to its common name. Acacia torta is adapted to rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia torta is primarily native to the western United States, including parts of Arizona, New Mexico, and Nevada. It is also found in northern Mexico, particularly in the states of Chihuahua and Sonora. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along dry slopes. It is commonly associated with desert scrub and chaparral ecosystems. Acacia torta is well adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia torta was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly used in reforestation projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing properties, which improve soil fertility. Its rapid growth and hardiness make it a popular choice for landscaping and windbreaks. However, it can become invasive in some areas if not managed properly."
