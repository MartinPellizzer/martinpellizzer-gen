    "intro": "Ajuga decumbens var. sinuata, commonly known as sinuous bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with ovate to elliptic leaves that have a distinctive sinuous or wavy margin. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form thick mats, making it a popular ground cover in shaded gardens."
