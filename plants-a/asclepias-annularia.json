    "intro": "Asclepias annularia, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as butterflies and bees. The plant has a taproot system and produces capsule fruits that contain toxic, milky sap. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Asclepias annularia plays a crucial role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae."
