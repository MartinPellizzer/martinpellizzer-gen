    "intro": "Astragalus sewertzowii var. orbiculatus, commonly known as the roundleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and palmately divided leaves, which are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hair. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its root system is extensive and fibrous, adapted to thrive in arid and rocky soils. This variant is notable for its rounded, orbiculate leaf shape, distinguishing it from other members of the Astragalus genus."
