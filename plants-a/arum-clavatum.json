    "intro": "Arum clavatum, commonly known as the clustered arrowhead, is a herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant features heart-shaped, arrowhead-like leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects, and its berries are red and edible for birds. Arum clavatum thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
