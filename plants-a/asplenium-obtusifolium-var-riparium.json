    "intro": "Asplenium obtusifolium var. riparium, commonly known as the river harts-tongue fern, is a perennial fern native to wetland and riparian habitats. It features glossy, lanceolate, and broadly ovate leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found along streams and in marshy areas. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important indicator species for wetland health."
