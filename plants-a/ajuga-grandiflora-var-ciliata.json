    "intro": "Ajuga grandiflora var. ciliata, commonly known as the broadleaf bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped leaves that have serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for ground cover in gardens and naturalized areas."
