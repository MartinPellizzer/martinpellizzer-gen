    "intro": "Arctium eriophorum, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant features a tall, hairy stem with large, heart-shaped leaves that are serrated along the edges. Its most distinctive characteristic is the spiky, bur-like fruit that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. The flowers are small and clustered in a composite head, typical of the daisy family."
