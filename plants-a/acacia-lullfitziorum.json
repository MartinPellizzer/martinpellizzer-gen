    "intro": "Acacia lullfitziorum, commonly known as the Lullfitz's wattle, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and feathery, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers arranged in cylindrical inflorescences, which attract a variety of pollinators such as bees and birds. Acacia lullfitziorum is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to access groundwater. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for local wildlife, as well as playing a role in soil stabilization in its native environment.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia lullfitziorum is primarily native to Western Australia. It is found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in the areas around the Fitzgerald River National Park. This species typically grows in sandy soils and is adapted to the semi-arid and Mediterranean climate of the region. It is commonly found in open woodlands and along riverbanks. Acacia lullfitziorum plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia lullfitziorum was mainly introduced to areas with dry, sandy soils and warm climates, particularly in regions of Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. It is commonly found in coastal dunes and inland sandplains where it thrives in full sun and low moisture conditions. This plant has been introduced for its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for native wildlife. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature. Its distribution has expanded beyond its native range, posing challenges for local ecosystems."
