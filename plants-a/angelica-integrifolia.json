    "intro": "Angelica integrifolia, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a biennial plant native to the western regions of North America. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems covered in white spots and large, umbrella-shaped leaves that can reach up to three feet in diameter. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a complex, branched inflorescence. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found along stream banks and forest edges. Due to its toxic sap, it is considered a noxious weed in many areas."
