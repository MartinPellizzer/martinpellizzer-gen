It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomatous structure allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats. The fronds are pinnately divided and often have a distinctive, almost lace-like appearance.",
