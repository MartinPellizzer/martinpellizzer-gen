    "intro": "Alyssum montanum proles pedemontanum, commonly known as the Alpine Alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage with finely textured leaves, and its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, and is often used in horticultural displays for its ornamental value. The species is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
