    "intro": "Aconitum \u00d7 halleri var. bicolor, commonly known as the bicolor monkshood, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple with a yellow throat, and its dark green, deeply lobed leaves. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. It produces toxic alkaloids, which can be harmful to humans and animals, requiring caution in cultivation. This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators.",
