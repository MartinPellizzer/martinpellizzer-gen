    "intro": "Andreettaea tapantiensis, commonly known as the Tapanti fern, is a unique and rare plant species native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are elongated and feather-like, with a distinctive arrangement that aids in water retention. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native region."
