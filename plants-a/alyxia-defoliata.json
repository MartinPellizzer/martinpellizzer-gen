    "intro": "Alyxia defoliata, commonly known as the leafless alyxia, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes milkweeds and other toxic plants. The plant is characterized by its lack of leaves, with only small, scale-like structures present along the stems. Its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers are typically pink or white and bloom in the summer. Alyxia defoliata is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid conditions."
