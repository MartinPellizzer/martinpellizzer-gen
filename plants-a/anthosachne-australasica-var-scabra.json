It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and compact growth habit, often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. The plant produces small, pale-green spikelets that are clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in temperate climates and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and urban environments."
