    "intro": "Asplenium itremoense, commonly known as the Iremo spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rock surfaces or in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, and it produces small, clustered spore-bearing structures called sorus. Asplenium itremoense is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution."
