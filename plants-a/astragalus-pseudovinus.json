    "intro": "Astragalus pseudovinus, commonly known as the pink milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pink to purple flowers. The plant is adapted to dry environments, with deep taproots that allow it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife, though it is not widely cultivated for agricultural purposes."
