It features dark green, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and is often used in aquariums and ponds. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly and densely. Its foliage provides excellent cover for aquatic life and helps in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients."
