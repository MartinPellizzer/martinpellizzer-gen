    "intro": "Aristida diffusa var. pseudohystrix, commonly known as the hairy false beardgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, hairy inflorescences. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers that are often pale green to brown in color. Its leaves are narrow and covered with fine, silky hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
