    "intro": "Antennaria leucophylla, commonly known as the white-leafed mouse-eared grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It features dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming habit with hairy, narrow leaves that are typically gray-green in color. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Antennaria leucophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
