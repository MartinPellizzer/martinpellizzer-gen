    "intro": "Avena carmelii, commonly known as Carmel oat or Carmel grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family, Poaceae. It is native to the coastal regions of California, particularly the Carmel area, where it thrives in sandy soils and rocky habitats. The plant produces slender, erect stems with narrow leaves and spikes of small, white to pale blue flowers. It is often found in disturbed or coastal environments and is adapted to tolerate salt spray and sandy conditions. Avena carmelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
