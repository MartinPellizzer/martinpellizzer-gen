    "intro": "Allium pauciflorum, commonly known as the few-flowered garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rounded bulbs and clusters of pale blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and mild garlic-like scent. Allium pauciflorum is relatively drought-tolerant and prefers well-drained soil, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
