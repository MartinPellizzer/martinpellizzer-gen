    "intro": "Athyrium fuliginosum, commonly known as the smoky wood fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is native to eastern North America and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a feathery appearance, with a dark green hue and a slightly smoky or grayish tint on the underside. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium fuliginosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and light conditions."
