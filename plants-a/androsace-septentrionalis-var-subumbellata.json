    "intro": "Androsace septentrionalis var. subumbellata, commonly known as the northern sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and arctic regions. It typically forms dense cushions or mats, which help it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant has small, usually white or pink flowers arranged in umbellate clusters, which are characteristic of the Androsace genus. Its leaves are often succulent and covered in fine hairs, providing protection against desiccation. This variety is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a common sight in high-altitude ecosystems."
