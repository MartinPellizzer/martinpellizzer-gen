    "intro": "Aster diffusus var. variifolius, commonly known as the variable leaf aster, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features a basal rosette of broadly ovate to lanceolate leaves that vary in shape and size, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple ray flowers surrounded by yellow disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators make it a desirable addition to native plant gardens."
