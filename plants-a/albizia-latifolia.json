    "intro": "Albizia latifolia, commonly known as the silk tree or mimosa tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves that resemble ferns and its showy, fluffy white or pink flower clusters. The plant produces flat, seed pods that split open to release numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Albizia latifolia is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in reforestation efforts."
