    "intro": "Astragalus caprinus var. dictyocarpus, commonly known as the Alpine milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, lanceolate leaves and produces yellow flowers in late summer. Its pods are slender and twisted, containing small, kidney-shaped seeds. This variant is distinguished by its unique leaf structure and habitat preferences, making it a notable species in high-altitude ecosystems."
