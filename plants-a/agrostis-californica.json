    "intro": "Agrostis californica, commonly known as California bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to western North America. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in coastal areas, wetlands, and disturbed sites. Botanically, it is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and ability to tolerate both wet and dry conditions."
