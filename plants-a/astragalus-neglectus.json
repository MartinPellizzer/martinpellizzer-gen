It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds.
