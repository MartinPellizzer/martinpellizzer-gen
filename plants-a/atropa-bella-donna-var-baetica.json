    "intro": "Atropa bella-donna var. baetica, commonly known as the Spanish belladonna, is a variant of the deadly nightshade plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and striking bell-shaped purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant contains toxic alkaloids such as atropine and scopolamine, which have historically been used in medicine and as a poison. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Due to its toxicity, it requires careful handling and is typically cultivated in controlled environments."
