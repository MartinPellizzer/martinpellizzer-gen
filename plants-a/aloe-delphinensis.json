    "intro": "Aloe delphinensis, commonly known as the Delphin island aloe, is a succulent plant native to the Cape Verde Islands. It features rosettes of fleshy, spiny leaves that store water, adapted to its arid environment. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellowish-green flowers, which attract pollinators. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their soothing properties. Aloe delphinensis is a rare species, facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
