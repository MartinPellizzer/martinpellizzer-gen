    "intro": "Aloe parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, spiny leaves that store water, typical of arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
