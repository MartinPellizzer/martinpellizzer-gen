    "intro": "Aralia salicifolia, commonly known as white hellebore, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with elongated, serrated leaflets resembling those of willow trees. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbels during the spring, which are followed by spiny, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native habitat."
