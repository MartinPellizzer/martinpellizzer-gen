    "intro": "Aleuritopteris cremea, commonly known as the golden huperzia, is a species of clubmoss belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, bright yellow-green foliage and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. Aleuritopteris cremea is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is valued for its air-purifying properties."
