    "intro": "Allium oleraceum var. alpestre, commonly known as the alpine leek, is a perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces umbels of white or pale purple flowers in late summer, which are followed by small, spherical bulbs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental or for its edible leaves."
