It belongs to the family Sarmentaceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and alternate, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, followed by small, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. Allophylus guaraniticus is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and riparian zones."
