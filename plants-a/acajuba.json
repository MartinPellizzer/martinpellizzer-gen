    "intro": "Acajuba, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, glossy leaves and produces an aggregate fruit that contains multiple seeds, each encased in a hard, woody shell. The tree can grow up to 50 meters tall and has a dense canopy that provides habitat for various wildlife species. Its fruit is harvested for the edible Brazil nuts, which are rich in nutrients like protein and healthy fats. The plant plays a crucial role in the ecological balance of the rainforest."
