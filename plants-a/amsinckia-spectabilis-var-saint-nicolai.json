It is characterized by its striking, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a taproot system and grows from 1 to 3 feet tall, with narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in dry, open habitats. The botanical name reflects its ornamental value and its resemblance to a fiddle, with its elongated flower clusters."
