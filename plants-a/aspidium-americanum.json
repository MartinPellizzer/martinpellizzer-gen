    "intro": "Aspidium americanum, commonly known as the American water fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically 20\u201340 cm long. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks and in wetlands. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Aspidium americanum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
