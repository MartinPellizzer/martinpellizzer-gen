    "intro": "Alectorolophus parviflorus proles fallax, commonly known as the dwarf-flowered alectorolophus, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific high-altitude regions. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in shades of pale pink and white. The plant has a compact growth habit with short, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
