    "intro": "Arachniodes damiaoshanensis, commonly known as the Damiaoshan arachniodes, is a rare evergreen fern native to China. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided, and often silvery-green fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, thriving in humid and cool climates. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it faces threats to its survival in the wild."
