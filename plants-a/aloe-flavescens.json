    "intro": "Aloe flavescens, commonly known as the yellow aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a yellowish tinge, which gives it its common name. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that is sometimes used for its purported medicinal properties. Aloe flavescens is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water to thrive."
