    "intro": "Arum maculatum f. parvulum, commonly known as the small-spotted arum, is a variant of the common arum characterized by its smaller, more compact leaves and distinctive spotted foliage. It is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in moist, shady woodland habitats. The plant produces a striking inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe, which is often green or purple in color. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers arranged separately on the spadix. This form is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and unique floral structure."
