It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and prairies. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
