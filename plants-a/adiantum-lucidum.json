It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically bright green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or wooded areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce aerial roots that help anchor it to surfaces. Adiantum lucidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.",
