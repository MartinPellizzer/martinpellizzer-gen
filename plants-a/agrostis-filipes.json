    "intro": "Agrostis filipes, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and tufted inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can help prevent soil erosion. Agrostis filipes is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in turfgrass mixes."
