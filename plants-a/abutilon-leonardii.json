This species is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these islands. It thrives in coastal areas and dry forests, often growing along the shoreline. The plant is well adapted to the warm, humid climate of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in the local flora of these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon leonardii was mainly introduced to the southwestern United States, particularly in Arizona and California. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and along creek banks. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings. Its introduction has led to its establishment in various habitats, sometimes outcompeting native vegetation. Due to its adaptability, it has become a common sight in arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States."
