It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense, overlapping leaves covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions. Its ornamental value and hardy nature make it a popular choice for landscaping in coastal and inland areas."
