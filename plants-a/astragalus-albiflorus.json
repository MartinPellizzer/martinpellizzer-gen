    "intro": "Astragalus albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets and produces cylindrical, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Astragalus albiflorus plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local pollinators."
