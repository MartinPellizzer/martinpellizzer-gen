    "intro": "Adonanthe cyllenea, commonly known as the golden star orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with a star-shaped pattern, which bloom in clusters during the rainy season. The plant has long, narrow leaves that help it absorb moisture from the air, typical of its epiphytic growth habit. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media. Adonanthe cyllenea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant.",
