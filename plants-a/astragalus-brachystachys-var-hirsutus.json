    "intro": "Astragalus brachystachys var. hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with stipules and has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in arid and rocky soils. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and along roadsides. This species is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for wildlife and livestock."
