    "intro": "Andropogon laniger, commonly known as hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, hair-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Botanically, it is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
