It typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowering heads are small and spike-like, producing numerous tiny seeds. Agrostis hookeriana is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
