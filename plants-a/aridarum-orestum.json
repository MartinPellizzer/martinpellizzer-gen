It is characterized by its woody stems and showy, pink or red flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from underground sources. Aridarum orestum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and resilience in harsh conditions."
