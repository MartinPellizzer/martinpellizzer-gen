    "intro": "Acacia longifolia var. floribunda, commonly known as the coastal wattles, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in dense, globular clusters. The plant is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion. Its ornamental value has also made it a popular garden plant in regions with a Mediterranean climate.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia longifolia var. floribunda is primarily native to southern Australia, including the states of South Australia, Western Australia, and Victoria. It is commonly found in coastal areas, sandy soils, and open woodlands. This variety is also known as the coastal wattle and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often seen along the coastline and in dunes, where it plays an important ecological role. The plant is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, with its flowering habit contributing to its ornamental value.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia longifolia var. floribunda was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and on disturbed soils, often spreading along roadsides and in urban environments. This plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, which contributes to its invasive potential. It has been reported to outcompete native vegetation, leading to concerns about its ecological impact. Despite its ornamental value, its spread is often managed to prevent further invasion of natural habitats."
