It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, helping it conserve water in arid conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens."
