    "intro": "Aristolochia hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan birthwort, is a flowering plant native to China, specifically the Hainan Island. It is a climbing vine that produces distinctive, tubular flowers with a complex, often foul-smelling structure. The plant belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, purple-tinged bracts. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and the plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals. Due to its medicinal use in traditional Chinese medicine, it is also considered an endangered species."
