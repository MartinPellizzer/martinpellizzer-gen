    "intro": "Aplocera maritima, commonly known as the salt marsh morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in brackish or saline wetlands, often found in salt marshes and tidal flats. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces trumpet-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the early morning. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in coastal environments. Aplocera maritima plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining the health of saltwater ecosystems."
