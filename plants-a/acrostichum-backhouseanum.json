    "intro": "Acrostichum backhouseanum, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a large, evergreen fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, trunk-like stem covered in a fibrous, brownish layer, with a crown of feathery fronds that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland forests. Its fronds are bi-directionally arranged, with both upper and lower surfaces bearing spore-producing structures. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.",
