    "intro": "Asperula lutea var. dasyphylla, commonly known as the golden woodrush, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant features slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth or along streambanks. Its botanical name reflects its distinctive yellow flower color and the dense, bushy appearance of its foliage."
