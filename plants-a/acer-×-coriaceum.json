    "intro": "Acer \u00d7 coriaceum, commonly known as the maple-leaf horse chestnut, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between the horse chestnut (Acer hippocastanum) and the maple (Acer pseudoplatanus). It is characterized by its palmate leaves that resemble those of maples, with five to seven lobes and a serrated margin. The plant produces showy white or pale pink flowers in clusters, which appear before the leaves in early spring. Its fruit is a spiny capsule that contains one or two chestnut-like seeds. This hybrid is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types.",
