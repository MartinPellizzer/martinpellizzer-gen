    "intro": "Arctostaphylos glauca var. eremicola, commonly known as the desert manzanita, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and small, leathery leaves that are adapted to arid environments. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by small, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its slow growth rate and compact form make it a desirable ornamental plant in dryland landscapes."
