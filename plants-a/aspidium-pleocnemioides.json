    "intro": "Aspidium pleocnemioides, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, pinnate fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium. Aspidium pleocnemioides plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various small organisms in its native ecosystems."
