This variant is typically associated with coastal and lowland areas. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open vegetation. The plant is part of the New Zealand flora and is adapted to the local climate and environmental conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena cylindristachya var. macrophyllidion was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the early European settlement and has since become naturalized in several regions. This plant is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in disturbed soils. Its spread has been facilitated by its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. However, it is considered a potential weed in some areas due to its aggressive growth habit."
