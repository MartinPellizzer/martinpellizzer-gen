    "intro": "Aeluropus littoralis var. pilosus, commonly known as coastal bristlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in saline and coastal environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves covered with fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, hairy appearance. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This variant is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
