    "intro": "Astragalus incertus var. bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces small, bean-shaped pods that contain several seeds, and its leaves are typically pinnately divided with a hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Astragalus incertus var. bicolor is often found in steppe and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
