It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers arranged in a cup-like inflorescence, which gives it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Aellenia auricula is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some cultures."
