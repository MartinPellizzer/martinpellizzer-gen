    "intro": "Aechmea egleriana var. major, commonly known as the large-leaf pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, which serves as a habitat for various microorganisms and small animals. The plant's foliage is often a vibrant mix of green and red, with some varieties displaying striking variegation. It produces a tall, branched inflorescence with showy, spathaceous flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, or red. This bromeliad is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in indirect light with minimal water."
