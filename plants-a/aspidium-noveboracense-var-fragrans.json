    "intro": "Aspidium noveboracense var. fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often fragrant when crushed. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
