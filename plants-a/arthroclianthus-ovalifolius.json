    "intro": "Arthroclianthus ovalifolius, commonly known as the oval-leaf arthroclianthus, is a shrub native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves, which are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its woody structure and evergreen foliage make it a notable species in its native habitat. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively obscure in horticultural circles."
