    "intro": "Asplenium anguifrons, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. Asplenium anguifrons is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its elegant, upright growth habit."
