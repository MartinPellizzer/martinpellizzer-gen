    "intro": "Asparagus angolensis, commonly known as the Angola asparagus, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along dry riverbeds. Asparagus angolensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a drought-tolerant garden plant."
