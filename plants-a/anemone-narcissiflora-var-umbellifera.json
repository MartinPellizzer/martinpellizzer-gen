    "intro": "Anemone narcissiflora var. umbellifera, commonly known as the umbellate anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features a basal rosette of finely cut, silvery-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces showy, white to pale pink flowers with five to seven petals, arranged in an umbel-like cluster at the end of each stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable, supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
