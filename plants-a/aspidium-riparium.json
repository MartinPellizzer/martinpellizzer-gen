    "intro": "Aspidium riparium, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are typically bipinnate, with small, linear pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water bodies such as streams and ponds. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant along the substrate. Aspidium riparium plays a role in maintaining aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various microorganisms and small aquatic life."
