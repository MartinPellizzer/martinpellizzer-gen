    "intro": "Aechmea angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pineapple plant, is a flowering bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and grass-like, forming a central cup that collects rainwater. The plant produces striking, spiky inflorescences that bloom in shades of red, orange, or yellow, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aechmea angustifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in humid environments."
