    "intro": "Ampelopsis quinquefolia var. dumetorum, commonly known as the creeping grapevines, is a perennial vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, typically with five leaflets, and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its vigorous growth habit makes it both a useful ground cover and a potential invasive species in certain areas."
