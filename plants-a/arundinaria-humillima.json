    "intro": "Arundinaria humillima, commonly known as the dwarf bamboo, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that grow close to the ground, forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture and a bluish-green hue. Arundinaria humillima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments."
