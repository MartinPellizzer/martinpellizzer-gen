    "intro": "Aralia spinosa, commonly known as American aralia, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves with a pinnate structure, often reaching up to 3 feet in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters, which are followed by spiny, spherical berries. Its roots and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported tonic and antispasmodic properties. Aralia spinosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas."
