It is characterized by its basal rosette of linear, hairy leaves and produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers in the spring. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and aesthetic features.
