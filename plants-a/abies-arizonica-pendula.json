    "intro": "Abies arizonica pendula, commonly known as the Arizona fir, is a coniferous tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its pendulous branches and needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The tree produces cones that are cylindrical and contain seeds enclosed in woody scales. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the mountainous regions of its native habitat.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies arizonica pendula is primarily native to the southwestern United States, particularly in Arizona and New Mexico. It thrives in high-elevation areas, often found in pine forests and mountainous regions. This species is commonly associated with rocky soils and cooler climates. It is typically found in the Madrean Archipelago and the Basin and Range Province. The plant is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid environments of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies arizonica pendula was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in areas with high elevation and cool, moist climates. It is commonly found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Colorado. This species is often planted in urban and suburban landscapes for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. However, it is not native to these areas and has been introduced for horticultural purposes. Its distribution is limited to specific microhabitats that mimic its natural mountainous environment."
