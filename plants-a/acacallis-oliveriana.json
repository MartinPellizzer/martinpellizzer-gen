    "intro": "Acacallis oliveriana, commonly known as the Oliver's acacia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its pod fruits and often nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and has a shrub-like appearance with small, compound leaves. Its flowers are yellow or orange and are clustered in inflorescences, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacallis oliveriana is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and parts of Nevada. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, including coastal dunes and sandy soils. This plant thrives in environments with low rainfall and high sunlight exposure. It is often associated with coastal scrub and maritime chaparral habitats. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacallis oliveriana was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and coastal dunes. It thrives in environments with full sun and well-drained soil, making it adaptable to a variety of ecological conditions. This plant is often found in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and mild, wet winters. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, including land clearing and agricultural expansion. Due to its rapid growth and reproductive capabilities, it can become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation."
