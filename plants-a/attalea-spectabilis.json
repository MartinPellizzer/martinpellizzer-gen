    "intro": "Attalea spectabilis, commonly known as the pink palm or the Brazilian pink palm, is a species of palm native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 6 meters in length. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which are often pollinated by insects. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that turns red when mature, containing a single seed. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
