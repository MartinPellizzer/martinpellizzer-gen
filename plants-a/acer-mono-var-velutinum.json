It is characterized by its distinctive velvety texture on the underside of its leaves, which gives it its common name. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a pointed tip and a smooth margin. This plant is native to specific regions in China and is often found in moist, shaded environments. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange samaras in the fall.",
