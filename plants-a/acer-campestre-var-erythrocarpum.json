It is characterized by its distinctive red or orange-red berries, which contrast with its palmate leaves. The plant typically grows in woodland edges and open areas, preferring well-drained soils. It produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by its striking fruits. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.",

This variety of the common horse chestnut is found in countries such as Ukraine, Russia, and Turkey. It thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with forested areas and open woodlands. The plant is known for its distinctive red-brown fruits, which contribute to its common name. Its natural range extends into the Caucasus region and parts of the Middle East.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer campestre var. erythrocarpum was mainly introduced to urban and suburban landscapes in Europe and North America for its ornamental value. It is valued for its distinctive red berries and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. This variety is often planted as a hedge or ornamental tree due to its compact growth habit. It has been widely cultivated in gardens and parks, contributing to local biodiversity in non-native regions. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to spread beyond cultivated areas."
