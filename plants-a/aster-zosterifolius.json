    "intro": "Aster zosterifolius, commonly known as the sea aster, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy blue to purple flowers in the summer. Its fibrous roots help stabilize dune ecosystems, making it an important pioneer species in coastal habitats. Aster zosterifolius is also valued for its ornamental appeal in maritime gardens."
