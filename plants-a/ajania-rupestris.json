    "intro": "Ajania rupestris, commonly known as the rock ajania, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing form. The plant features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the summer months. Ajania rupestris is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
