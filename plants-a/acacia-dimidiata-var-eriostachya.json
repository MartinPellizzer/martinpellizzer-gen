It is found in regions such as the Western Cape, Eastern Cape, and parts of the Free State. This plant typically grows in rocky outcrops, grasslands, and along riverbanks. It is well adapted to the dry and semi-arid climates of its native range. The variety is known for its distinctive yellow flowers and is often used in local horticulture.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia dimidiata var. eriostachya was mainly introduced to South Africa, particularly in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces. It is commonly found in coastal areas and along the edges of forests. This plant is often used for soil stabilization due to its deep root system. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and requires full sun exposure. Its introduction has been beneficial for ecological restoration projects in these regions."
