    "intro": "Alectorolophus alpinus, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often with a white or yellow throat. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Alectorolophus alpinus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
