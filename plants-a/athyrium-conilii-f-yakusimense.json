    "intro": "Athyrium conilii f. yakusimense, commonly known as the Yakusim fern, is a fern species native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching in growth habit. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous structure. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady garden settings."
