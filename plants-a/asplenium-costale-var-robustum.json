    "intro": "Asplenium costale var. robustum, commonly known as the robust fern, is a variant of the common rock fern. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, serrated margin. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or woodland areas. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for both garden cultivation and ecological restoration projects."
