    "intro": "Aristolochia marshii, commonly known as the marsh Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and is often found growing along the edges of swamps and marshes. Its flowers emit a mild, somewhat unpleasant odor, which attracts specific pollinators like flies. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity and its historical use in traditional medicine."
