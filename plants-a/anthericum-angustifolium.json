    "intro": "Anthericum angustifolium, commonly known as narrowleaf lily of the valley, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense colonies. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The flowers emit a mild fragrance and are visited by various pollinators, including bees and flies."
