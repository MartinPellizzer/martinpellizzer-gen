    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria f. baldaccii, commonly known as the Balkan broomrape, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll and chloroplasts, making it a hemiparasitic plant that relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense spikes, and its seeds are enclosed in pods. It is native to the Balkan Peninsula and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Due to its parasitic nature and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
