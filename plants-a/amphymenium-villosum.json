    "intro": "Amphymenium villosum, commonly known as the hairy marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in temperate regions. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers arranged in spikelets, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly rough texture. Amphymenium villosum plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems and provides habitat for various invertebrates."
