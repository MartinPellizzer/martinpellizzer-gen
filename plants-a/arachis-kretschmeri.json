It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into pods containing edible seeds. It is closely related to the cultivated peanut (Arachis hypogaea) and shares similar botanical features. Due to its genetic similarity, it is often studied for its potential in crop improvement and resistance to diseases."
