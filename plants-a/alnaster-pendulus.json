    "intro": "Alnaster pendulus, commonly known as the weeping alnus, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its pendulous branches that create a cascading appearance, giving it a distinctive and ornamental look. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated margin, contributing to its overall aesthetic. Alnaster pendulus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands."
