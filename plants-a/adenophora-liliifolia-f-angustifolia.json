It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. It is native to regions of East Asia, including China, and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens.
