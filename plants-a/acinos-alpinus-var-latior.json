    "intro": "Acinos alpinus var. latior, commonly known as the broadleaf alpine cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing alpine soils.",
