    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia brevispica subsp. dregeana is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically occurring in countries such as South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, including the Karoo and Kalahari regions. This subspecies thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in shrubland and savanna habitats. It is well adapted to the hot, dry climate of its native range. The plant is an important component of the local ecosystem and is sometimes used for its timber or as a source of firewood.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia brevispica subsp. dregeana was mainly introduced to South Africa, particularly in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces. It has been widely planted for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid conditions. The distribution of this subspecies is largely confined to coastal and mountainous regions where it forms part of the local vegetation. It is also found in some parts of KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern highveld. Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to other regions outside its native range for landscaping and reclamation purposes."
