    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha virginica var. ovalifolia is primarily native to the southeastern United States, including states such as Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and Alabama. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams. This variety is particularly adapted to the humid climate and seasonal flooding typical of its native range. It is often seen in coastal areas and can tolerate salt spray in some regions. Its distribution is largely limited to the Atlantic and Gulf coastal plains.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha virginica var. ovalifolia was mainly introduced to regions with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun exposure. It thrives in temperate climates and is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and vacant lots. This plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value due to its vibrant foliage. It has been reported in several states across the eastern United States. However, its spread is limited due to its preference for specific environmental conditions."
