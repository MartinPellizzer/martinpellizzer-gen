    "intro": "Ansellia, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, round, floating leaves that can reach up to three meters in diameter. The plant produces showy, white or pink flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Ansellia thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, making it a key species in wetland ecosystems."
