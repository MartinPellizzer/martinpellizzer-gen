    "intro": "Asplenium prolongatum, commonly known as the long-leaf spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that often form dense, mat-like growths on rocky or shaded surfaces. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in lines along the veins. Asplenium prolongatum is relatively hardy and can thrive in a variety of humid, temperate climates."
