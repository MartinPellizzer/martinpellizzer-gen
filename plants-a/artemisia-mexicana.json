    "intro": "Artemisia mexicana, commonly known as Mexican wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant contains volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its strong medicinal and pesticidal properties. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its chemical composition, it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
