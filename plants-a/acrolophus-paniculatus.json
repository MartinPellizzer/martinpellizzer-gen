    "intro": "Acrolophus paniculatus, commonly known as the panicled acrolophus, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features finely divided, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers, which are typically white or pale yellow, are arranged in compound umbels, a feature common in the carrot family. The fruit is a small, dry schizocarp that splits into two mericarps upon maturity, aiding in seed dispersal.",
