    "intro": "Acer foveolatum, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive red to orange-red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental species. The tree has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5\u20139 cm in length. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The bark is smooth and reddish-brown when young, becoming furrowed with age.",
