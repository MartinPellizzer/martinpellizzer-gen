It is characterized by its simple, opposite, and usually elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in panicle-like clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that turns red when mature, containing a single seed. It is often found in moist, shaded areas of lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses."
