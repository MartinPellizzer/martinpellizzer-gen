    "intro": "Adenolepis, commonly known as the \"bottle tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. These plants are characterized by their thick, bottle-shaped trunks that store water, allowing them to thrive in arid environments. Adenolepis species are native to Australia and are often found in dry, sandy soils. They produce small, pea-like flowers that can be white, yellow, or purple, depending on the species. The leaves are typically compound and may be shed during periods of drought, further aiding the plant's survival in harsh conditions."
