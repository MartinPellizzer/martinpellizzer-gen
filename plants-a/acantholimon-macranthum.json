    "intro": "Acantholimon macranthum, commonly known as the tall stonecress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually linear and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, which help reduce water loss. Acantholimon macranthum is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon macranthum is primarily native to Afghanistan. It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the eastern and central parts. This plant thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing at higher elevations. It is adapted to the harsh climate and limited soil conditions of its native habitat. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is not commonly found outside of Afghanistan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon macranthum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in arid or semi-arid regions. It is commonly found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, fields, and gravelly slopes. This plant has adapted well to dry climates and can thrive in low-nutrient soils. Its introduction has been noted in several regions of the western United States. However, it is considered a non-native species and may compete with native vegetation in certain habitats."
