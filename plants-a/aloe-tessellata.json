    "intro": "Aloe tessellata, commonly known as the zigzag aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, ribbed leaves that form a compact rosette, with a unique zigzag pattern along the leaf edges. The leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. It produces tall, branched flower stalks that bear yellow or orange flowers, which bloom in the summer months. This plant is well-suited for xeriscaping and is relatively low maintenance once established."
