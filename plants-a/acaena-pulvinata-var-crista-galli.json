    "intro": "Acaena pulvinata var. crista-galli, commonly known as the \"crown-of-thorns\" or \"thorned burr,\" is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It features dense, spiny foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers followed by distinctive, spiky, burr-like fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. Due to its prickly nature, it is sometimes used as a hedging plant or in erosion control.",

This plant typically grows in coastal areas and on rocky slopes. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within New Zealand's native flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena pulvinata var. crista-galli was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature. The introduction occurred in the 19th century, primarily through horticultural trade and botanical collections. It has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in coastal and disturbed areas. However, its spread is limited compared to other invasive species in the region."
