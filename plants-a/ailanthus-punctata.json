    "intro": "Ailanthus punctata, commonly known as the spotted ailanthus, is a flowering plant native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Simaroubaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing seeds. Ailanthus punctata is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive in non-native regions."
