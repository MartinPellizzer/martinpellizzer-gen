    "intro": "Asplenium holstii, commonly known as the Holst's spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the undersides of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. Asplenium holstii is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
