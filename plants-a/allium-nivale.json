It produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a short, grass-like stem and is characterized by its clustered bulbs, which are often used in culinary applications. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy perennial in cooler climates. Allium nivale is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
