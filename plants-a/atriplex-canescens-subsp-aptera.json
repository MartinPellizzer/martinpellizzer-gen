    "intro": "Atriplex canescens subsp. aptera, commonly known as silverleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine hairs that reduce water loss. The plant has small, green to yellowish leaves that are typically opposite or clustered at the base of the stems. It produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are followed by three-winged seeds. This subspecies is adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it an important plant in desert ecosystems."
