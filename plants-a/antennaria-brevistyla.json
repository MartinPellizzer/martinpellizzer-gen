    "intro": "Antennaria brevistyla, commonly known as the short-styled mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant features dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow and are borne in clusters near the base of the stems. Antennaria brevistyla is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions."
