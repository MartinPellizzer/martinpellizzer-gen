    "intro": "Allium chamaemoly var. longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved garlic chive, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves that are often used in culinary applications for their mild garlic flavor. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its bulbs are typically smaller than those of common garlic and are often used as a garnish or in salads. Botanically, it belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is closely related to other allium species such as garlic and onions."
