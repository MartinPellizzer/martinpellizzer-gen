It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky areas.

The subspecies is distinguished by its distinctive yellow-green spots on the leaves, which give it its common name."
