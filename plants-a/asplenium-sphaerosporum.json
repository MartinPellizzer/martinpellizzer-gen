    "intro": "Asplenium sphaerosporum, commonly known as the globe spleenwort, is a small evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices, soil banks, and forest floors. The plant has a compact rosette of dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are round and clustered on the underside of the leaves, giving it its common name. Asplenium sphaerosporum is characterized by its slow growth and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
