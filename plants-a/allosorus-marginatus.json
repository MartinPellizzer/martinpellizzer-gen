The lichen's morphology includes a light-colored, often whitish or pale yellowish cortex with a darker medulla. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, commonly found on bark and rock surfaces in temperate regions. Allosorus marginatus is notable for its chemical composition, containing various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological role and potential medicinal applications."
