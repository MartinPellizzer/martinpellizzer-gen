It is a perennial grass species that thrives in coastal and inland salt marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny flowers. Aeluropus hirsutus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
