    "intro": "Agave coetocapnia subsp. clivicola, commonly known as the cliff-dwelling agave, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick, fleshy, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The leaves are typically blue-green in color with marginal teeth and a spiny margin, providing both structural support and a defense mechanism. It produces a tall, branching inflorescence that bears white to pale green flowers, which are pollinated by insects and bats. This subspecies is well adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it a resilient and hardy plant."
