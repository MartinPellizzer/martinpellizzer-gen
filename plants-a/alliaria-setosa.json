    "intro": "Alliaria setosa, commonly known as winter garlic, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, pale green leaves that are slightly hairy and emit a garlic-like odor when crushed. The plant produces tiny white or greenish flowers in clusters during late winter to early spring. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Alliaria setosa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
