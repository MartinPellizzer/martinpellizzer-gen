    "intro": "Ajuga latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features dense mats of dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, sky-blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form thick ground cover."
