It features a basal rosette of narrow, silvery-hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
