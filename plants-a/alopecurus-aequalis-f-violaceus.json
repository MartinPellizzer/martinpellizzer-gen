    "intro": "Alopecurus aequalis f. violaceus, commonly known as violet false oat, is a variant of the common bluegrass species. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant features fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, delicate flowers that are often a pale violet or blue color. Its botanical characteristics include a fibrous root system and a rhizomatous growth habit, which helps it spread and establish in suitable habitats. This form is distinguished by its unique floral coloration compared to the typical green-flowered variety of the species."
