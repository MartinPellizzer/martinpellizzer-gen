    "intro": "Agrostis canina var. stolonifera, commonly known as the bentgrass or creeping bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its stoloniferous growth habit, which allows it to spread horizontally and form dense mats. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and disturbed areas. Its fine texture and ability to withstand foot traffic make it a popular choice for turfgrass applications."
