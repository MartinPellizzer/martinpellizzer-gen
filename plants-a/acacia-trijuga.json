    "intro": "Acacia trijuga, commonly known as the three-angled acacia, is a small shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant has slender, trifoliate leaves and produces yellow flowers that are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. Acacia trijuga is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in regions with a Mediterranean climate.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia trijuga is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland and hill forests. This species thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found along roadsides and in secondary forests. Acacia trijuga plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia trijuga was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded lands. It is commonly used in reforestation projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This plant is also valued for its hardy nature and capacity to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility. It has been introduced to several regions in Africa and parts of Asia for ecological restoration. Its rapid growth and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for land rehabilitation efforts."
