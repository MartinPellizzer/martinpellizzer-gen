    "intro": "Artemisia fasciculata, commonly known as narrowleaf sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and small, yellowish flower clusters. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Artemisia fasciculata plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
