    "intro": "Aquilegia vulgaris subsp. grata, commonly known as the garden columbine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and western Asia. It features striking, spurred flowers in shades of red, yellow, and orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound, pinnate leaves with finely divided lobes, and its stems are generally unbranched and somewhat hairy. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation. The subspecies grata is noted for its more compact growth habit compared to the typical A. vulgaris."
