    "intro": "Aster quercifolius, commonly known as the New England aster, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its showy, violet-blue to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, with lance-shaped, serrated leaves resembling those of an oak tree. Its scientific name reflects the leaf shape, while its common name refers to its geographic origin and floral appearance. Aster quercifolius is often found in moist meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks."
