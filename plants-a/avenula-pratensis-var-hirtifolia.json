    "intro": "Avenula pratensis var. hirtifolia, commonly known as hairy field grass, is a variant of the field grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive appearance. This plant typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. It is a perennial herb that produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. The hairy texture of its foliage helps it retain moisture and resist herbivory."
