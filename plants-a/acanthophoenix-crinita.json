This palm species is found in the tropical regions of the island, particularly in coastal areas and limestone formations. It thrives in humid, warm climates with well-drained soils. The plant is commonly seen in natural habitats and is also cultivated in botanical gardens. Its presence is an important indicator of the unique biodiversity of R\u00e9union.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthophoenix crinita was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance and adaptability. It is commonly found in coastal areas and garden landscapes where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant is often used in landscaping to add a tropical aesthetic to urban and residential environments. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several non-native habitats, sometimes resulting in local ecological impacts. Despite its beauty, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in certain regions."
