    "intro": "Athyrium \u00d7 pseudowardii, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Athyrium filix-femina and Athyrium nipponicum. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed, and often bi- or tri-pinnate fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies. The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
