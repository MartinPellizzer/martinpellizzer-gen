    "intro": "Aspicarpa triphylla, commonly known as the three-leafed aspicarpa, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid to semi-arid environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and the flowers are usually white or pale pink. Aspicarpa triphylla is often found in shrubland and woodland habitats, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
