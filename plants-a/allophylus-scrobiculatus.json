    "intro": "Allophylus scrobiculatus, commonly known as the rough-leaved alder, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub native to the western Pacific islands. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often rough to the touch, with a distinctive serrated margin. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by red or orange berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in coastal and moist forest environments, often growing in shaded or semi-shaded conditions. Allophylus scrobiculatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
