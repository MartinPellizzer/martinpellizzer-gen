    "intro": "Anisacanthus stramineus, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces spherical, fuzzy seed pods that split open to release seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
