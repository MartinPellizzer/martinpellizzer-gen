This plant typically grows in coastal and lowland areas, often in sandy or gravelly soils. It is part of the bramble family and is known for its spiny stems and small, urn-shaped flowers. Acaena hirsutula plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various native wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena hirsutula was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the early European settlement and has since become naturalized in various regions. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in coastal areas and on farmland. It is considered an invasive species in some parts of New Zealand due to its ability to spread rapidly. Its distribution is now widespread across the country, particularly in the North Island."
