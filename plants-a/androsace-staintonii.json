    "intro": "Androsace staintonii, commonly known as the Stainton's rock jasmine, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy texture that helps it retain moisture in rocky, well-drained soils. Androsace staintonii is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, harsh environments."
