    "intro": "Agrostis glaucina, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery or bluish bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, flowering units typical of the Poaceae family. Agrostis glaucina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
