    "intro": "Aristida glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth grass or slender threeawn, is a perennial grass species native to the southern United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, woodlands, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often concealed by the foliage. Its seeds are adapted for wind dispersal, contributing to its ability to colonize various environments. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
