    "intro": "Apicra pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf apicra, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Apicra pumilio thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in mountainous ecosystems."
