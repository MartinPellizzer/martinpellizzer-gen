    "intro": "Acanthonotus, commonly known as the spiny hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the Malvaceae family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plants typically have woody stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, yellow, and orange. They often have spiny or thorny structures on their stems and leaves, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Acanthonotus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
