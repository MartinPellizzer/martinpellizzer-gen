    "intro": "Atriplex canescens subsp. macropoda, commonly known as desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are often accompanied by bracts. It has a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers. This subspecies is well adapted to saline soils and is often found in desert scrub and washland habitats."
