    "intro": "Allantodia paludosa, commonly known as the marsh bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, hairy stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a waxy surface. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Allantodia paludosa plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is an indicator species for healthy wetland ecosystems."
