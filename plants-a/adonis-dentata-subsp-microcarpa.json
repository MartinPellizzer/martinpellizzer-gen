    "intro": "Adonis dentata subsp. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf white hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine white down. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers with prominent yellow stamens, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is toxic and should be handled with care.",
