    "intro": "Asclepias vanilla, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking pink to purple flowers, which are clustered in umbels and attract a variety of pollinators, including butterflies and bees. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. Its milky sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals but serve as a defense mechanism. Asclepias vanilla plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae."
