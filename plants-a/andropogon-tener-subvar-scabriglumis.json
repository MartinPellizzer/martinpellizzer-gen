    "intro": "Andropogon tener subvar. scabriglumis, commonly known as rough bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green blades and rough, hairy texture, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and prairies, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its inflorescence consists of narrow, spike-like clusters of small, pale green to brownish flowers. This grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in disturbed areas."
