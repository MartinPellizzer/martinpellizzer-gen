    "intro": "Agropyron reflexiaristatum, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high mountain regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded grassland areas."
