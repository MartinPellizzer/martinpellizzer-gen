    "intro": "Arenaria recurva, commonly known as the bent sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with succulent, often hairy leaves that help it survive in harsh, cold environments. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Arenaria recurva plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native ecosystems and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations."
