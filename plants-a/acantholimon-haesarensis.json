    "intro": "Acantholimon haesarensis, commonly known as the Haesarensis thrift, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage consists of narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Acantholimon haesarensis is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland scrub habitats.",

It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in mountainous areas. It is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. The species is part of the Caryophyllaceae family and is known for its distinctive floral structure.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon haesarensis was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils, typically in open habitats such as coastal dunes, rocky slopes, and disturbed sites. It thrives in regions with a Mediterranean climate characterized by dry summers and wet winters. This plant is often found in regions of southern Europe, including parts of Spain, France, and Italy, where it has been naturalized. It is commonly associated with coastal and maritime environments due to its tolerance for salt spray and poor soil conditions. Its introduction has been primarily through human activity, such as landscaping and accidental transport."
