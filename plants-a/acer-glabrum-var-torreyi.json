    "intro": "Acer glabrum var. torreyi, commonly known as the Torrey maple, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, light green bark and palmate leaves that turn vibrant yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in its native habitat.",
