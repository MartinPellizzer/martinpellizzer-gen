    "intro": "Allium chamaemoly var. battandieri, commonly known as the purple onion. This perennial herb is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and striking purple-pink flowers. It produces small, round bulbs that are similar to onions but are often used in ornamental gardening rather than culinary applications. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens or alpine settings. Its botanical features include fibrous roots, cylindrical stems, and basal leaves that are typically blue-green in color."
