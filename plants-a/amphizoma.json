    "intro": "Amphizoma, commonly known as the false lily of the valley, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Plantaginaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are perennial herbs native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped and clustered at the base, with small, bell-shaped flowers that are often white or pale pink. Amphizoma species are characterized by their rhizomatous growth habit and are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value. They prefer moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade in their natural habitats."
