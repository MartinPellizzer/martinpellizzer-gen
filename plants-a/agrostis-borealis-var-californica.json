    "intro": "Agrostis borealis var. californica, commonly known as California bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to coastal regions of California. It features fine, dark green leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and wetlands. It has small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal, it is sometimes used in landscaping and restoration projects."
