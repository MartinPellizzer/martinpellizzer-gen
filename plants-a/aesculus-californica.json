    "intro": "Aesculus californica, commonly known as the California buckeye, is a deciduous tree native to California. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are deeply divided into five to seven lobes. The tree produces showy, white, clustered flowers in the spring, followed by spiny, green husks that contain shiny, brown seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. The plant is notable for its toxicity, as all parts contain saponins that can be harmful to humans and animals."
