    "intro": "Alyssum serpyllifolium var. longistylum, commonly known as creeping alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with slender, branching stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread readily. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground cover."
