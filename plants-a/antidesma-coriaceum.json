    "intro": "Antidesma coriaceum, commonly known as the African ebony or black antidesma, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, round, black berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Antidesma coriaceum is valued for its hard, dense wood, which has been traditionally used for crafting and as a source of tannins."
