    "intro": "Arum maculatum subvar. alpinum, commonly known as the Alpine Calla, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features a striking, spatulate leaf that is often marked with dark green veins and a pale, waxy sheath. The plant produces an upright, spadix surrounded by a white to pale green spathe, which gives it its characteristic appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it is considered toxic due to the presence of calcium oxalate crystals."
