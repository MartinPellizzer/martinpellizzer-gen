    "intro": "Aporum bipulvinatum, commonly known as the two-pulvinated aporum, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive two-pulvinated leaves, which are specialized structures that allow for movement in response to environmental stimuli. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical rainforests. Its flowers are small and clustered, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Aporum bipulvinatum is considered a vulnerable species."
