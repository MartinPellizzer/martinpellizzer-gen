    "intro": "Agrostis crinum-ursi, commonly known as the mountain bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and tufted inflorescences that produce small, spike-like flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in harsh conditions. Agrostis crinum-ursi is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity."
