    "intro": "Aspidium purdiei, commonly known as the African maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Aspidium purdiei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
