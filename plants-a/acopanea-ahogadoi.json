    "intro": "Acopanea ahogadoi, commonly known as the Ahogadoi cactus, is a rare species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, which are followed by small, red fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered a vulnerable species.",
