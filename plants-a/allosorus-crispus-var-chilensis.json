It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures include spore-bearing cones, which are clustered at the base of the plant. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
