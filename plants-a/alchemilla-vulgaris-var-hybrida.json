    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, erect stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and long flowering period."
