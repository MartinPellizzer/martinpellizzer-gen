    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-seeded alder, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its serrated, ovate leaves and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. The tree produces small, clustered flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits that contain several seeds. It is often found in wetland areas and is known for its nitrogen-fixing capabilities through symbiotic relationships with Frankia bacteria. This species plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and habitat provision for various wildlife species."
