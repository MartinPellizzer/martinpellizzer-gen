    "intro": "Adenanthos \u00d7 pamelus, commonly known as the hybrid snowflakes, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Adenanthos corymbiflorus and Adenanthos tenuifolius. It is a shrub native to southern Australia, characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, fluffy white flowers that resemble snowflakes, typically appearing in spring. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to coastal and dry garden environments. Due to its hybrid nature, it is not typically found in the wild and is primarily propagated through seed or cuttings.",
