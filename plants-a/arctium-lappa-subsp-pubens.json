It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, covered with dense, glandular hairs. The leaves are large, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture with a hairy surface. Its flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets, and it produces bur-like fruits with hooked bracts that aid in seed dispersal. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
