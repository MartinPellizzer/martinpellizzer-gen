    "intro": "Apodostigma, commonly known as the stigma without a stalk, is a specialized structure found in certain flowering plants, particularly in the genus *Lepanthes* within the orchid family. It is a small, rounded, and often sticky surface located at the tip of the female reproductive organ, the pistil. The apodostigma plays a crucial role in pollen adhesion and fertilization by providing a receptive surface for pollen grains. Its unique morphology allows for efficient pollination, especially in species that rely on specific pollinators. This feature is an adaptation that enhances reproductive success in certain ecological contexts."
