    "intro": "Athyrium interjectum, commonly known as the Japanese painted fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, lacy fronds that are often variegated with white or silver markings. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. Athyrium interjectum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
