    "intro": "Astragalus andersonii var. sepultipes, commonly known as the Anderson's milkvetch, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Mojave Desert. It is a low-growing perennial forb with yellow flowers and hairy stems, adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in creosote bush and blackbrush communities. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance."
