    "intro": "Androsace aizoon subsp. aizoon, commonly known as the alpine buttonweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically forms a dense mat of hairy, fleshy leaves that are often succulent, adapted to harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early summer, arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes. Its compact growth habit and frost-resistant properties make it a characteristic component of alpine flora."
