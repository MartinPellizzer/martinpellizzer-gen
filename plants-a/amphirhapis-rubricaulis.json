    "intro": "Amphirhapis rubricaulis, commonly known as the red-stemmed cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its distinct, slender, reddish stems that become more pronounced with age. The plant produces large, feather-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a unique appearance. Its cones, which are the reproductive structures, are typically borne on separate male and female plants. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Amphirhapis rubricaulis is considered critically endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
