    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 lucrosum, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. It reproduces vegetatively through spores rather than seeds, as it is not fertile. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and garden cultivation."
