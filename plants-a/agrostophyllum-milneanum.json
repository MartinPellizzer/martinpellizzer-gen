    "intro": "Agrostophyllum milneanum, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and coastal winds. Agrostophyllum milneanum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
