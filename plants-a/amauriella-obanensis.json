    "intro": "Amauriella obanensis, commonly known as the Oban sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Scottish Highlands. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches a height of about 10 centimeters. The plant features small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are succulent, adapted to the harsh, sandy environments it inhabits. Amauriella obanensis is a rare and endemic species, found primarily in specific coastal and heathland areas. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to its environment and its role in the local flora."
