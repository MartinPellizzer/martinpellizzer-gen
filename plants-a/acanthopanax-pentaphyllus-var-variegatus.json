    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthopanax pentaphyllus var. variegatus is primarily native to eastern Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan. It is commonly found in mountainous regions with temperate climates. This plant thrives in forested areas, often growing on rocky or sloped terrain. It is particularly associated with the Korean Peninsula and parts of southern China. Its natural habitat includes humid environments with well-drained soil.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopanax pentaphyllus var. variegatus was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping. It is commonly found in urban and suburban areas where it is cultivated for its ornamental value. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade conditions. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions outside its native range. However, its impact on local ecosystems is still being studied."
