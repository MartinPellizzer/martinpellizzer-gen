    "intro": "Aster foliaceus var. sublinearis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf aster, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features slender, linear leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length, arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of blue to purple, blooming from late summer into early fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a suitable choice for wetland gardens. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
