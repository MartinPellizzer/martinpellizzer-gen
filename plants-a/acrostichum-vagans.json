    "intro": "Acrostichum vagans, commonly known as the wandering fern, is a tropical plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Davalliaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mangrove swamps and coastal areas. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas and contribute to soil stabilization. Acrostichum vagans plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.",
