    "intro": "Arabis hoffmannii, commonly known as Hoffmann's rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically features basal leaves that are kidney-shaped and hairy, while its stems are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. It produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Arabis hoffmannii is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a resilient choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
