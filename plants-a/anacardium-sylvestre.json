    "intro": "Anacardium sylvestre, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon basin. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into woody, spiny capsules. The tree produces edible seeds, known as Brazil nuts, which are enclosed within the hard, three-chambered fruit. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in association with other canopy-forming trees. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
