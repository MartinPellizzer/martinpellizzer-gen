    "intro": "Arenaria ciliaris var. saginoides, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically features small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with wiry stems and tiny, linear leaves that help it conserve water in harsh alpine environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats at high elevations. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cold, arid conditions and contribute to its ecological significance in alpine ecosystems."
