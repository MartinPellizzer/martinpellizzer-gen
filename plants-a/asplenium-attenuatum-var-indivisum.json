    "intro": "Asplenium attenuatum var. indivisum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant. The leaves are usually dark green and have a slightly glossy surface, contributing to its ornamental value."
