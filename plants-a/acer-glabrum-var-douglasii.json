    "intro": "Acer glabrum var. douglasii, commonly known as Douglas maple, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in forest ecosystems.",
