    "intro": "Agrostis alpina, commonly known as alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in width. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to golden flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Agrostis alpina thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
