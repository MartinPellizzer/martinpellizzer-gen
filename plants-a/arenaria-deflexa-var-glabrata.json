    "intro": "Arenaria deflexa var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry climates."
