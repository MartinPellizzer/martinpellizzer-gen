    "intro": "Acetosella crispula, commonly known as mouse-eared chickweed, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky habitats. Acetosella crispula is often found in association with other ground-covering plants in temperate regions.",
