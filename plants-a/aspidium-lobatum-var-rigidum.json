    "intro": "Aspidium lobatum var. rigidum, commonly known as rigid holly fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features dark green, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are stiff and upright, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a common sight in woodland settings. Its rigid, upright fronds and adaptability to shaded environments contribute to its ornamental value in gardens."
