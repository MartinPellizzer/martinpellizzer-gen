    "intro": "Arenaria rubra subsp. marina, commonly known as the maritime sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant adapted to coastal environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and rocky shores. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in salty, wind-swept conditions. Its flowers are typically pink or white, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. This subspecies is notable for its resilience to harsh maritime climates and its role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
