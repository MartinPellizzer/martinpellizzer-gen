    "intro": "Acrocephalus heudelotii, commonly known as the yellow marsh grass, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in marshes, fens, and other moist environments, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear yellowish-green flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in wet soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates.",
