It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a stalk. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators.",
