    "intro": "Anteriorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the wetlands of Florida and Cuba. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant's unique appearance includes pale green leaves and a single, delicate white flower that blooms once a year. Anteriorchis has a specialized root system that allows it to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its habitat specificity and declining environment, it is considered a vulnerable species."
