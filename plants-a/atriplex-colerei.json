    "intro": "Atriplex colerei, commonly known as the saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its succulent leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is highly adapted to saline soils and can thrive in environments with low water availability. Its leaves are often coated with a waxy layer to reduce water loss, and it has a deep root system to access groundwater. Atriplex colerei plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
