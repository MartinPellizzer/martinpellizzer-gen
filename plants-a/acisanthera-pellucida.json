    "intro": "Acisanthera pellucida, commonly known as the glassy bladdernut, is a species of flowering plant in the family Hippocastanaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, where it typically grows in moist, wooded areas. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Acisanthera pellucida is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.",
