    "intro": "Arenaria grandiflora var. triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically forms dense mats of fleshy, succulent leaves that help it survive in arid and rocky environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters of three, which is characteristic of its name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
