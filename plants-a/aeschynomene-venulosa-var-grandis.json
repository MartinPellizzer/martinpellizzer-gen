    "intro": "Aeschynomene venulosa var. grandis, commonly known as large-veined aeschynomene, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and alternate leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, three-lobed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
