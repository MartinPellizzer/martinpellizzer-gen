    "intro": "Aloe weloensis, commonly known as the Welo aloe, is a succulent plant native to Ethiopia. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched flower stalks that bear yellowish-green flowers, adding ornamental value. It is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is occasionally cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry climates."
