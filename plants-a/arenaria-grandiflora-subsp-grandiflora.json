    "intro": "Arenaria grandiflora subsp. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value lies in its compact growth habit and delicate floral display."
