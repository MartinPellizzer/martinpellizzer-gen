It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped spathe that ranges from red to orange in color. The plant produces small, greenish-white spadices inside the spathe, which are the actual flowers. Anthurium recavum thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its unique foliage and striking inflorescence make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
