    "intro": "Angraecum subclavatum, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It features long, slender, white or pale green inflorescences with star-shaped flowers that are highly specialized for pollination by hawkmoths. The plant has thick, fleshy roots adapted for storing water, and its leaves are typically dark green and strap-like. It blooms at night, producing fragrant flowers that attract nocturnal pollinators. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is considered a flagship species for conservation efforts in Madagascar."
