    "intro": "Arthrostylidium haenkei, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in regions of Argentina and Chile. It is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in rocky, arid environments, often growing on cliffs or among stones. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive spurred lip, which is a characteristic feature of many orchid species. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the rocky substrates where it grows. Arthrostylidium haenkei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
