    "intro": "Avena chinensis, commonly known as Chinese oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to East Asia. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are wind-pollinated. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in ecological restoration. Avena chinensis is often found in moist soils along riverbanks and in open woodlands."
