    "intro": "Acaena floribunda, commonly known as the flowering acaena, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its dense, spiny growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin. Acaena floribunda is often found in coastal and subalpine regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena floribunda is primarily native to South America, specifically found in regions of Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay. It thrives in temperate climates and is commonly associated with grasslands and shrublands. This species is well adapted to dry and semi-arid environments, often growing in disturbed soils. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food for various herbivores. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes introduced to other regions as an ornamental or for erosion control.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena floribunda was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and compact growth habit. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local biodiversity and habitat integrity."
