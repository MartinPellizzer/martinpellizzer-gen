    "intro": "Acanthophyllum andersenii, commonly known as the Anderson's jointfoot, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub with small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to sandy and gravelly soils, often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a species of conservation concern.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthophyllum andersenii is primarily native to Iran. It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the country, particularly in the central and eastern parts. This plant thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often in areas with low precipitation. It is an important component of the local flora in these harsh environments. Its distribution is closely linked to specific ecological conditions found predominantly in Iran.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthophyllum andersenii was mainly introduced to areas with arid and semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions such as the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its ability to stabilize soil and withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its introduction has been primarily for ecological restoration and land management purposes. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential impacts on native plant communities."
