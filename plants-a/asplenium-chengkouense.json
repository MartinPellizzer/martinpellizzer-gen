It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features lanceolate, serrated leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or forest floors. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
