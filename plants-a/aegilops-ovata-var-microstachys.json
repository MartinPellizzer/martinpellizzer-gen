    "intro": "Aegilops ovata var. microstachys, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage crop."
