    "intro": "Allium kurdaicum, commonly known as Kurdish leek, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and northern Iraq. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of broad, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces umbels of white or pale purple flowers in the summer months. Its bulbous stem is often used in local cuisines for its mild, onion-like flavor. Botanically, it is closely related to other Allium species such as garlic and chives."
