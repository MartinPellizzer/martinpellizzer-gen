    "intro": "Anthemis deserticola, commonly known as the desert everlasting, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with its deep root system and silver-green foliage that reflects sunlight. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
