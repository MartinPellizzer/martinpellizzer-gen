    "intro": "Asclepias incarnata var. pulchra, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a striking perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features tall, slender stems that bear clusters of pink to purple flowers, which bloom in midsummer. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its flowers are specialized to accommodate the pollination needs of monarch butterflies. It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and produces seed pods that split open to release tiny seeds with silky filaments. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance as a food source for pollinators."
