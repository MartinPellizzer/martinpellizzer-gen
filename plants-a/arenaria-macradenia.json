    "intro": "Arenaria macradenia, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats or cushions, adapted to harsh, rocky environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually fleshy and succulent, helping it retain moisture in arid conditions. Arenaria macradenia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas."
