    "intro": "Argyrolobium sessilifolium, commonly known as the sessile-leaved silverlobium, is a perennial legume native to South Africa. It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, and its leaves are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without stalks. The plant has a compact growth habit and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
