    "intro": "Androsace \u00d7 schachtii, commonly known as the hybrid snowbell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are usually hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in harsh alpine environments. Androsace \u00d7 schachtii is often cultivated in rock gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
