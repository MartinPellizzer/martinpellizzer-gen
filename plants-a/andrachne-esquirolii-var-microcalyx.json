    "intro": "Andrachne esquirolii var. microcalyx, commonly known as the dwarf sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features small, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers. This variety is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or rocky habitats."
