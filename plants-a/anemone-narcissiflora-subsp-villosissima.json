    "intro": "Anemone narcissiflora subsp. villosissima, commonly known as the woolly anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of showy, white or pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has a compact growth habit. Its flowers are borne on long, slender pedicels and are composed of numerous petal-like sepals. The subspecies is distinguished by its dense, woolly pubescence on the stems and leaves, which gives it its common name."
