    "intro": "Astrolepis sinuata, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, undulating fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that can form dense mats. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a feathery appearance, and are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Astrolepis sinuata is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist forest understories."
