    "intro": "Aquilegia einseleana subf. longiuscula, commonly known as the long-stalked alpine columbine, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of the European Alps. It is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, with five petals that are elongated and spurred at the base. The plant has basal leaves that are palmately lobed and are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
