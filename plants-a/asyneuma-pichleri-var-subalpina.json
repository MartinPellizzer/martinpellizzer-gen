It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, purple to pink flowers during the summer months. It is part of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions. This variant is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth compared to other varieties of Asyneuma."
