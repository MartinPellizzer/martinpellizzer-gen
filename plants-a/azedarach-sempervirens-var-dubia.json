    "intro": "Azedarach sempervirens var. dubia, commonly known as the desert candle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, candle-like yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. The plant has small, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement. It is adapted to hot, dry climates and requires well-drained soil. The varietal form 'dubia' is known for its more compact growth habit compared to the typical species."
