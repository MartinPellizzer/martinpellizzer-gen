    "intro": "Arenaria tetraquetra subsp. imbricata, commonly known as the sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed habitats. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in the spring, followed by edible, succulent fruits that are sometimes consumed by wildlife. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize sandy soils."
