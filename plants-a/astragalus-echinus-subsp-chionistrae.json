    "intro": "Astragalus echinus subsp. chionistrae, commonly known as the snow-haired milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. Its subspecific name, *chionistrae*, refers to its association with snow-covered habitats. The species is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid and alpine environments."
