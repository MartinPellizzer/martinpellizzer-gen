    "intro": "Aristolochia nelsonii, commonly known as Nelson's Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, maroon-colored flowers that resemble a pipe, hence its common name. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and is often found in moist, wooded areas. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is known for its complex floral structure that attracts specific pollinators. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
