    "intro": "Anthyllis media, commonly known as the narrow-leafed clover, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming from spring to early summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being narrow and lance-shaped. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Anthyllis media is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for ecological restoration projects."
