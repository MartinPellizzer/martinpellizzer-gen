    "intro": "Allocarya minuta var. reticulata, commonly known as the small netted lichen, is a species of lichen characterized by its intricate thallus structure and distinct coloration. It typically grows on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate forest environments. The thallus is usually crustose, with a finely reticulated surface that gives it its common name. It exhibits a pale to dark green or yellowish hue, depending on environmental conditions. This lichen is often used in ecological studies to assess air quality and habitat health due to its sensitivity to pollution."
