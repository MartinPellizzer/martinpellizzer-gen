    "intro": "Anthurium pranceanum, commonly known as the Prance's anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the lowland rainforests of Costa Rica. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces striking spadices, which are modified leaves that house the actual flowers, often in shades of red or orange. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated as a houseplant but is also at risk of habitat loss in the wild."
