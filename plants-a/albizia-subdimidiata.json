    "intro": "Albizia subdimidiata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Albizia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are composed of numerous small, feather-like leaflets. The plant produces fragrant, pale yellow to cream-colored flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Albizia subdimidiata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
