It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to survive in extreme climates with limited nutrients and water."
