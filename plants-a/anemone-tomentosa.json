    "intro": "Anemone tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly anemone, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features showy, white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and produces numerous hairy, reddish-brown stems. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in a dense, woolly layer of hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas."
