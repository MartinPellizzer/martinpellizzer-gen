    "intro": "Aster rivularis, commonly known as the river aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist habitats in North America. It typically grows in wet meadows, stream banks, and other waterlogged areas, thriving in nutrient-rich soils. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers with purple-blue petals and yellow centers, blooming from late summer to early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped, alternate, and often covered in fine hairs. Aster rivularis plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in wetland ecosystems."
