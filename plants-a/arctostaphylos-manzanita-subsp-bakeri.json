    "intro": "Arctostaphylos manzanita subsp. bakeri, commonly known as Baker's manzanita, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically leathery and covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red in color, which bloom in late spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds. Baker's manzanita is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, and it plays an important role in supporting local wildlife."
