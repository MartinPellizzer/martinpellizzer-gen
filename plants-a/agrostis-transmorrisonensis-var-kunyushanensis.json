    "intro": "Agrostis transmorrisonensis var. kunyushanensis, commonly known as the Kunyu Shan bentgrass, is a rare and endemic grass species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant typically thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically fragile species."
