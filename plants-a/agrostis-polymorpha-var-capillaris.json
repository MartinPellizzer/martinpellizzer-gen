    "intro": "Agrostis polymorpha var. capillaris, commonly known as silky bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features fine, hair-like leaves that give it a soft, silky appearance, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is often found in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded or partially shaded environments. Its dense growth habit makes it suitable for use in lawns and as a ground cover. Botanically, it is characterized by its rhizomatous growth and ability to form mats, contributing to its ecological and horticultural significance."
