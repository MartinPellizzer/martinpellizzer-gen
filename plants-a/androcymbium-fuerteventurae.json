    "intro": "Androcymbium fuerteventurae, commonly known as the Fuerteventura orchid, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively on the Canary Island of Fuerteventura. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral structure and specialized adaptations to its arid environment. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in areas with limited water availability. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with a distinctive coloration that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered a conservation priority."
