    "intro": "Avenastrum pratense var. pastorale, commonly known as meadow oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained to moist soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that often form dense clumps, and its leaves are narrow, grass-like, with a bluish-green hue. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
