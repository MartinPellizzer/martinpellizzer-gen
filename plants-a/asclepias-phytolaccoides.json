    "intro": "Asclepias phytolaccoides, commonly known as the purple milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its striking purple to pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its stems are erect and somewhat woody at the base. It produces distinctive seed pods called follicles, which contain numerous seeds with silky white filaments that aid in wind dispersal. This species is an important host plant for monarch butterflies and other pollinators."
