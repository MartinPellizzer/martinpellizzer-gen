    "intro": "Astragalus maxwellii, commonly known as Maxwell's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its seeds are enclosed in a pod that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Astragalus maxwellii is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
