This plant is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these areas. It thrives in moist, shaded environments within forest understories. The species is part of the Poaceae family, known for its grass-like appearance. Its natural range is limited to specific habitats in these regions of Brazil.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthostachys pitcairnioides was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. It is commonly found in open areas such as roadsides and disturbed sites. However, it is not considered a major invasive species in New Zealand."
