    "intro": "Alsine viscosa var. hybrida, commonly known as sticky alsike, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features prostrate or ascending stems that are covered in sticky hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and also bear a sticky coating. Small white or pale blue flowers are arranged in clusters, and the plant produces small, oblong seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
