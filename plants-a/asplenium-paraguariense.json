It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves with a serrated margin, and its fronds are often clustered closely together. It produces spores in small, clustered clusters on the underside of its fertile fronds. Asplenium paraguariense is native to South America, particularly Paraguay and Brazil, and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
