    "intro": "Agave vexans, commonly known as the desert agave, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in white to yellowish tubercles. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears showy, yellowish-green flowers. It is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping. Agave vexans is also known for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber."
