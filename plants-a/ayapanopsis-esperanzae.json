    "intro": "Ayapanopsis esperanzae, commonly known as the Esperanza ayapanopsis, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has a compact, shrub-like structure. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ayapanopsis esperanzae is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
