    "intro": "Astragalus preussii var. eastwoodiae, commonly known as the Eastwood's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its small, compound leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
