It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a silvery underside, giving it its common name. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in cymes. Alchemilla rothii is often found in moist, calcareous soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
