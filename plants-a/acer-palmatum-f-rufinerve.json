    "intro": "Acer palmatum f. rufinerve, commonly known as the red-veined maple, is a cultivar of the Japanese maple characterized by its striking foliage. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a delicate, feathery texture and a vibrant green upper surface. The most distinctive feature is the deep red or crimson veins that contrast beautifully against the lighter green leaf blades. This ornamental plant thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. It is valued for its seasonal color changes, particularly the brilliant red and orange hues it displays in autumn.",
