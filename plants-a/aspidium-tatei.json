    "intro": "Aspidium tatei, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a species of fern native to Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to substrates. Aspidium tatei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
