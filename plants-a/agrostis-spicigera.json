    "intro": "Agrostis spicigera, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
