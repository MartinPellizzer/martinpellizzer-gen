    "intro": "Aconitum stylosum var. geniculatum, commonly known as the curly-stemmed monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features striking blue to purple spurred flowers arranged in a raceme, which are characteristic of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has dark green, doubly serrated leaves that are alternate and often have a hairy texture. Its stems are distinctive for their twisting, curling growth habit, which gives it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.",
