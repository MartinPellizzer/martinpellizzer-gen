    "intro": "Alchemilla acutangula f. autumnalis, commonly known as the autumnal lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its dense, silver-white foliage that turns a striking coppery hue in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer to early autumn, which are clustered in branched inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
