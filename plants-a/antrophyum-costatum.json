It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves with serrated edges, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that transition into bright red berries, attracting various wildlife. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with a dense, bushy form that thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
