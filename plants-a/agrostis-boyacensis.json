    "intro": "Agrostis boyacensis, commonly known as the Boyacensis bentgrass, is a species of grass native to South America, particularly Colombia. It is a low-growing perennial grass that typically forms dense mats on the ground. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized plant in its native habitat."
