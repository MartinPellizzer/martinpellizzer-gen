    "intro": "Allium damascenum, commonly known as the purple garlic or globe flower, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features a short, stout stem that bears a dense cluster of showy, globe-shaped purple flowers. The plant's leaves are long, narrow, and grass-like, emerging from a basal rosette of fleshy, white or pale green bulbs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or dry habitats. Allium damascenum is valued in gardens for its ornamental flowers and is also used in traditional medicine."
