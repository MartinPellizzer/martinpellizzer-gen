    "intro": "Angianthus plumiger, commonly known as the skyflower, is a striking plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its unique appearance, with flowers that seem to float above the foliage, gives it its common name. Angianthus plumiger is also noted for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
