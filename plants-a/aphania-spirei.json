    "intro": "Aphania spirei, commonly known as the spiral spire orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves and its striking, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of purple and pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the acidic, well-drained soils of its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Aphania spirei is considered a vulnerable species."
