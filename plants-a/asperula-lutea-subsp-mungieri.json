It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to yellow. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a serrated margin. The subspecies is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and slightly different flower morphology compared to the typical form of Asperula lutea."
