    "intro": "Apium graveolens var. tuberosum, commonly known as parsnip, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its hollow, ridged stems and umbellate inflorescences. The plant produces a swollen, cylindrical root that is the primary edible part, rich in nutrients like vitamin C and fiber. Its leaves are fern-like and can be used in cooking, though the root is more commonly consumed. The plant thrives in cool climates and well-drained soils, often cultivated for its distinct sweet, nutty flavor."
