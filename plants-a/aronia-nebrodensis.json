    "intro": "Aronia nebrodensis, commonly known as the Italian black chokeberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, elliptical leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces berries that transition from green to red and finally to a deep black, which are edible but have a tart, astringent flavor. Aronia nebrodensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential medicinal properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its berries and landscape value."
