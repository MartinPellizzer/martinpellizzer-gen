    "intro": "Artemisia alpina, commonly known as alpine wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Artemisia alpina has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its purported digestive and antiseptic properties. Its essential oils contain compounds like thujone and camphor, which contribute to its strong scent and medicinal uses."
