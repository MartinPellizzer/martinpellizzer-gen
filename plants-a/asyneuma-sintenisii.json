It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils. It produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
