It features compound leaves that are typically divided into 5 to 7 narrow, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbels, which are followed by spherical, red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Aralia brevifolia is often used in woodland gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
