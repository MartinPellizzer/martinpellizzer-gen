    "intro": "Astragalus matthewsii, commonly known as Matthews' milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils, often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are pinnately compound, consisting of several pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. Astragalus matthewsii is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
