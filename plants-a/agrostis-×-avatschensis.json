    "intro": "Agrostis \u00d7 avatschensis, commonly known as the Alpine bentgrass, is a hybrid grass species native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions with limited soil nutrients. Its reproductive strategy involves producing small, wind-dispersed seeds, which aid in its colonization of open, rocky habitats. Agrostis \u00d7 avatschensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine flora and fauna."
