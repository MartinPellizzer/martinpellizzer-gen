    "intro": "Acer regelii, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters and prefers well-drained soil in a partially shaded to sunny location. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. Acer regelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its seasonal color changes.",
