    "intro": "Aethionema grandiflorum, commonly known as the rock\u767d\u83dc or rock cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, four-petaled flowers in early spring, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
