    "intro": "Angraecum falcatum, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid or the cat's tail orchid, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Madagascar. It features long, narrow, leathery leaves that form a rosette shape, and it produces striking white or pale yellow flowers with long, slender spurs. The plant is adapted to grow on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. It blooms during the dry season, typically between May and August, and relies on specific pollinators like the hawkmoth. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
