It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in clusters during the summer months. Alchemilla alniformis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks."
