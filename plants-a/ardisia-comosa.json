    "intro": "Ardisia comosa, commonly known as the shining evergreen or Chinese evergreen, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. Ardisia comosa thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden areas. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal fruit display."
