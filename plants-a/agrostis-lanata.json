    "intro": "Agrostis lanata, commonly known as silky bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves that are covered in dense, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like clusters of pale green to brownish flowers. Agrostis lanata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass mixes."
