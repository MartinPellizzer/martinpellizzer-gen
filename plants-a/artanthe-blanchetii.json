    "intro": "Artanthe blanchetii, commonly known as the Sierra snowplant, is a perennial herb native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is characterized by its rosette of basal, waxy, blue-green leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid, high-elevation habitat. The plant produces upright stems that bear clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Artanthe blanchetii is a rare and protected species, often found in alpine meadows and talus slopes."
